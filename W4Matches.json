  "abstract": "The heating of the solar chromosphere and corona to the observed high temperatures, imply the presence of ongoing heating that balances the strong radiative and thermal conduction losses expected in the solar atmosphere. It has been theorized for decades that the required heating mechanisms of the chromospheric and coronal parts of the active regions, quiet-Sun, and coronal holes are associated with the solar magnetic fields. However, the exact physical process that transport and dissipate the magnetic energy which ultimately leads to the solar plasma heating are not yet fully understood. The current understanding of coronal heating relies on two main mechanism: reconnection and MHD waves that may have various degrees of importance in different coronal regions. In this review we focus on recent advances in our understanding of MHD wave heating mechanisms. First, we focus on giving an overview of observational results, where we show that different wave modes have been discovered in the corona in the last decade, many of which are associated with a significant energy flux, either generated in situ or pumped from the lower solar atmosphere. Afterwards, we summarise the recent findings of numerical modelling of waves, motivated by the observational results. Despite the advances, only 3D MHD models with Alfvén wave heating in an unstructured corona can explain the observed coronal temperatures compatible with the quiet Sun, while 3D MHD wave heating models including cross-field density structuring are not yet able to account for the heating of coronal loops in active regions to their observed temperature.",

  "abstract": "Core accretion is the conventional model for the formation of the gas giant planets. The model may also apply to the icy giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, except that it may take upward of 50 Myr for them to form at their present orbital distances, which is beyond the maximum 5 Myr lifetime of the solar nebula. A plausible alternative is formation in the region of the gas giants, followed by migration to their present locations at 20 and 30 AU. Another alternative is the gravitational instability model, which is much faster and does not require the formation of a core first. In either scenario, heavy elements (mass &gt; helium) provide the critical observational constraints. Additionally, helium and neon abundances in the observable troposphere are indicators of the interior processes in the megabar region. We investigate the atmospheric regions most suitable for accessing the above elements. Volatiles containing some of the elements (C, N, S, O) undergo condensation on the icy giants. On the other hand, noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), which are chemically inert, non-condensible, and uniform all over the planet, can provide the best constraints to the formation and migration models of Uranus and Neptune. Only entry probes are capable of measuring the key elements and isotopic ratios. They are accessible at 5-10 bars, except for the condensibles. Data from an orbiter on gravity, magnetic field, upper atmospheric composition and the maps of ammonia and water with depth would be a valuable complement to the situ measurements.",

  "abstract": "Uranus and Neptune, and their diverse satellite and ring systems, represent the least explored environments of our Solar System, and yet may provide the archetype for the most common outcome of planetary formation throughout our galaxy. Ice Giants will be the last remaining class of Solar System planet to have a dedicated orbital explorer, and international efforts are under way to realise such an ambitious mission in the coming decades. In 2019, the European Space Agency released a call for scientific themes for its strategic science planning process for the 2030s and 2040s, known as Voyage 2050. We used this opportunity to review our present-day knowledge of the Uranus and Neptune systems, producing a revised and updated set of scientific questions and motivations for their exploration. This review article describes how such a mission could explore their origins, ice-rich interiors, dynamic atmospheres, unique magnetospheres, and myriad icy satellites, to address questions at the heart of modern planetary science. These two worlds are superb examples of how planets with shared origins can exhibit remarkably different evolutionary paths: Neptune as the archetype for Ice Giants, whereas Uranus may be atypical. Exploring Uranus' natural satellites and Neptune's captured moon Triton could reveal how Ocean Worlds form and remain active, redefining the extent of the habitable zone in our Solar System. For these reasons and more, we advocate that an Ice Giant System explorer should become a strategic cornerstone mission within ESA's Voyage 2050 programme, in partnership with international collaborators, and targeting launch opportunities in the early 2030s.",

  "abstract": "There are still many open questions regarding the nature of Uranus and Neptune, the outermost planets in the Solar System. In this review we summarize the current-knowledge about Uranus and Neptune with a focus on their composition and internal structure, formation including potential subsequent giant impacts, and thermal evolution. We present key open questions and discuss the uncertainty in the internal structures of the planets due to the possibility of non-adiabatic and inhomogeneous interiors. We also provide the reasoning for improved observational constraints on their fundamental physical parameters such as their gravitational and magnetic fields, rotation rates, and deep atmospheric composition and temperature. Only this way will we be able to improve our understating of these planetary objects, and the many similar-sized objects orbiting other stars.",

  "abstract": "The isotopic dichotomy between non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites indicates that meteorite parent bodies derive from two genetically distinct reservoirs, which presumably were located inside (NC) and outside (CC) the orbit of Jupiter and remained isolated from each other for the first few million years of the solar system. Here we review the discovery of the NC-CC dichotomy and its implications for understanding the early history of the solar system, including the formation of Jupiter, the dynamics of terrestrial planet formation, and the origin and nature of Earth's building blocks. The isotopic difference between the NC and CC reservoirs is probably inherited from the solar system's parental molecular cloud and has been maintained through the rapid formation of Jupiter that prevented significant exchange of material from inside (NC) and outside (CC) its orbit. The growth and/or migration of Jupiter resulted in inward scattering of CC bodies, which accounts for the co-occurrence of NC and CC bodies in the present-day asteroid belt and the delivery of presumably volatile-rich CC bodies to the growing terrestrial planets. Earth's primitive mantle, at least for siderophile elements like Mo, has a mixed NC-CC composition, indicating that Earth accreted CC bodies during the final stages of its growth, perhaps through the Moon-forming giant impactor. The late-stage accretion of CC bodies to Earth is sufficient to account for the entire budget of Earth's water and highly volatile species.",

  "abstract": "One popular view of Venus' climate history describes a world that has spent much of its life with surface liquid water, plate tectonics, and a stable temperate climate. Part of the basis for this optimistic scenario is the high deuterium to hydrogen ratio from the Pioneer Venus mission that was interpreted to imply Venus had a shallow ocean's worth of water throughout much of its history. Another view is that Venus had a long-lived (∼100 million years) primordial magma ocean with a CO<SUB>2</SUB> and steam atmosphere. Venus' long-lived steam atmosphere would sufficient time to dissociate most of the water vapor, allow significant hydrogen escape, and oxidize the magma ocean. A third scenario is that Venus had surface water and habitable conditions early in its history for a short period of time (&lt;1 Gyr), but that a moist/runaway greenhouse took effect because of a gradually warming Sun, leaving the planet desiccated ever since. Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate the viability of the first scenario using the few observational constraints available. We further speculate that large igneous provinces and the global resurfacing hundreds of millions of years ago played key roles in ending the clement period in its history and presenting the Venus we see today. The results have implications for what astronomers term \"the habitable zone,\" and if Venus-like exoplanets exist with clement conditions akin to modern Earth, we propose to place them in what we term the \"optimistic Venus zone.\"",

  "abstract": "This brief review will discuss the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the nitrogen atmospheres of the icy bodies in the solar system, particularly of Titan, Triton and Pluto. An important tool to analyse and understand the origin and evolution of these atmospheres can be found in the different isotopic signatures of their atmospheric constituents. The <SUP>14</SUP>N/<SUP>15</SUP>N ratio of the N<SUB>2</SUB>-dominated atmospheres of these bodies serve as a footprint of the building blocks from which Titan, Triton and Pluto originated and of the diverse fractionation processes that shaped these atmospheres over their entire evolution. Together with other measured isotopic and elemental ratios such as <SUP>12</SUP>C/<SUP>13</SUP>C or <SUP>36</SUP>Ar/N<SUB>2</SUB> these atmospheres can give important insights into the history of the icy bodies in the solar system, the diverse processes that affect their N<SUB>2</SUB>-dominated atmospheres, and the therewith connected solar activity evolution. Titan's gaseous envelope most likely originated from ammonia ices with possible contributions from refractory organics. Its isotopic signatures can yet be seen in the - compared to Earth - comparatively heavy <SUP>14</SUP>N/<SUP>15</SUP>N ratio of 167.7, even though this value slightly evolved over its history due to atmospheric escape and photodissociation of N<SUB>2</SUB>. The origin and evolution of Pluto's and Triton's tenuous nitrogen atmospheres remain unclear, even though it might be likely that their atmospheres originated from the protosolar nebula or from comets. An in-situ space mission to Triton such as the recently proposed Trident mission, and/or to the ice giants would be a crucial cornerstone for a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the icy bodies in the outer solar system and their atmospheres in general. Due to the importance of the isotopic measurements for understanding the origin and evolution of the icy bodies in the solar system, this review will also give a brief discussion on the diverse isotope measurement techniques with a focus on nitrogen.",

  "abstract": "Europa is the closest and probably the most promising target to search for extant life in the Solar System, based on complementary evidence that it may fulfil the key criteria for habitability: the Galileo discovery of a sub-surface ocean; the many indications that the ice shell is active and may be partly permeable to transfer of chemical species, biomolecules and elementary forms of life; the identification of candidate thermal and chemical energy sources necessary to drive a metabolic activity near the ocean floor. <P />In this article we are proposing that ESA collaborates with NASA to design and fly jointly an ambitious and exciting planetary mission, which we call the Joint Europa Mission (JEM), to reach two objectives: perform a full characterization of Europa's habitability with the capabilities of a Europa orbiter, and search for bio-signatures in the environment of Europa (surface, subsurface and exosphere) by the combination of an orbiter and a lander. JEM can build on the advanced understanding of this system which the missions preceding JEM will provide: Juno, JUICE and Europa Clipper, and on the Europa lander concept currently designed by NASA (Maize, report to OPAG, 2019). <P />We propose the following overarching goals for our Joint Europa Mission (JEM): Understand Europa as a complex system responding to Jupiter system forcing, characterize the habitability of its potential biosphere, and search for life at its surface and in its sub-surface and exosphere. We address these goals by a combination of five Priority Scientific Objectives, each with focused measurement objectives providing detailed constraints on the science payloads and on the platforms used by the mission. The JEM observation strategy will combine three types of scientific measurement sequences: measurements on a high-latitude, low-altitude Europan orbit; in-situ measurements to be performed at the surface, using a soft lander; and measurements during the final descent to Europa's surface. <P />The implementation of these three observation sequences will rest on the combination of two science platforms: a soft lander to perform all scientific measurements at the surface and sub-surface at a selected landing site, and an orbiter to perform the orbital survey and descent sequences. We describe a science payload for the lander and orbiter that will meet our science objectives. <P />We propose an innovative distribution of roles for NASA and ESA; while NASA would provide an SLS launcher, the lander stack and most of the mission operations, ESA would provide the carrier-orbiter-relay platform and a stand-alone astrobiology module for the characterization of life at Europa's surface: the Astrobiology Wet Laboratory (AWL). Following this approach, JEM will be a major exciting joint venture to the outer Solar System of NASA and ESA, working together toward one of the most exciting scientific endeavours of the 21st century: to search for life beyond our own planet.",

  "abstract": "The Galilean moons play major roles in the giant magnetosphere of Jupiter. At the same time, the magnetospheric particles and fields affect the moons. The impact of magnetospheric ions on the moons' atmospheres supplies clouds of escaping neutral atoms that populate a substantial fraction of their orbits. At the same time, ionization of atoms in the neutral cloud is the primary source of magnetospheric plasma. The stability of this feedback loop depends on the plasma/moon-atmosphere interaction. The purpose of this review is to describe the physical processes that shape the space environment around the two innermost Galilean moons—Io and Europa—and to show their impact from the planet Jupiter out into interplanetary space.",

  "abstract": "The distant ice giants of the Solar System, Uranus and Neptune, have only been visited by one space mission, Voyager 2. The current knowledge on their composition remains very limited despite some recent advances. A better characterization of their composition is however essential to constrain their formation and evolution, as a significant fraction of their mass is made of heavy elements, contrary to the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. An in situ probe like Galileo would provide us with invaluable direct ground-truth composition measurements. However, some of the condensibles will remain out of the grasp of a shallow probe. While additional constraints could be obtained from a complementary orbiter, thermochemistry and diffusion modeling can further help us to increase the science return of an in situ probe.",

  "abstract": "The nature and structure of the observed east-west flows on Jupiter and Saturn have been a long-standing mystery in planetary science. This mystery has been recently unraveled by the accurate gravity measurements provided by the Juno mission to Jupiter and the Grand Finale of the Cassini mission to Saturn. These two experiments, which coincidentally happened around the same time, allowed the determination of the overall vertical and meridional profiles of the zonal flows on both planets. This paper reviews the topic of zonal jets on the gas giants in light of the new data from these two experiments. The gravity measurements not only allow the depth of the jets to be constrained, yielding the inference that the jets extend to roughly 3000 and 9000 km below the observed clouds on Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, but also provide insights into the mechanisms controlling these zonal flows. Specifically, for both planets this depth corresponds to the depth where electrical conductivity is within an order of magnitude of 1 S m<SUP>-1</SUP>, implying that the magnetic field likely plays a key role in damping the zonal flows. An intrinsic characteristic of any gravity inversion, as discussed here, is that the solutions might not be unique. We analyze the robustness of the solutions and present several independent lines of evidence supporting the results presented here.",

Our results show that the equatorial (east-west) diameters of the solar corona at the above two frequencies shrunk steadily.

  "abstract": "Our knowledge of the properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere is constrained by the relative lack of plasma observations between the Sun and 1 AU. In this work, we present a comprehensive catalog of 47 CMEs measured in situ measurements by two or more radially aligned spacecraft (MESSENGER, Venus Express, STEREO, Wind/ACE). We estimate the CME impact speeds at Mercury and Venus using a drag-based model and present an average propagation profile of CMEs (speed and deceleration/acceleration) in the inner heliosphere. We find that CME deceleration continues past Mercury's orbit but most of the deceleration occurs between the Sun and Mercury. We examine the exponential decrease of the maximum magnetic field strength in the CME with heliocentric distance using two approaches: a modified statistical method and analysis from individual conjunction events. Findings from both the approaches are on average consistent with previous studies but show significant event-to-event variability. We also find the expansion of the CME sheath to be well fit by a linear function. However, we observe the average sheath duration and its increase to be fairly independent of the initial CME speed, contradicting commonly held knowledge that slower CMEs drive larger sheaths. We also present an analysis of the 3 November 2011 CME observed in longitudinal conjunction between MESSENGER, Venus Express, and STEREO-B focusing on the expansion of the CME and its correlation with the exponential falloff of the maximum magnetic field strength in the ejecta.",

  "abstract": "We compare Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of Jupiter during 2007 with a rich multi-instrument data set including upstream in situ solar wind measurements from the New Horizons spacecraft, radio emissions from the Nançay Decametric Array and Wind/Waves, and ultraviolet (UV) observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. New Horizons data revealed two corotating interaction regions (CIRs) impacted Jupiter during these observations. Non-Io decametric bursts and UV emissions brightened together and varied in phase with the CIRs. We characterize three types of X-ray aurorae: hard X-ray bremsstrahlung main emission, pulsed/flared soft X-ray emissions, and a newly identified dim flickering (varying on short time scales, but quasi-continuously present) aurora. For most observations, the X-ray aurorae were dominated by pulsed/flaring emissions, with ion spectral lines that were best fit by iogenic plasma. However, the brightest X-ray aurora was coincident with a magnetosphere expansion. For this observation, the aurorae were produced by both flickering emission and erratic pulses/flares. Auroral spectral models for this observation required the addition of solar wind ions to attain good fits, suggesting solar wind entry into the outer magnetosphere or directly into the pole for this particularly bright observation. X-ray bremsstrahlung from high energy electrons was only bright for one observation, which was during a forward shock. This bremsstrahlung was spatially coincident with bright UV main emission (power &gt; 1 TW) and X-ray ion spectral line dusk emission, suggesting closening of upward and downward current systems during the shock. Otherwise, the bremsstrahlung was dim, and UV main emission power was also lower (&lt;700 GW), suggesting their power scaled together.",

  "abstract": "With recent advances in the field of machine learning, the use of deep neural networks for time series forecasting has become more prevalent. The quasi-periodic nature of the solar cycle makes it a good candidate for applying time series forecasting methods. We employ a combination of WaveNet and Long Short-Term Memory neural networks to forecast the sunspot number using the years 1749 to 2019 and total sunspot area using the years 1874 to 2019 time series data for the upcoming Solar Cycle 25. Three other models involving the use of LSTMs and 1D ConvNets are also compared with our best model. Our analysis shows that the WaveNet and LSTM model is able to better capture the overall trend and learn the inherent long and short term dependencies in time series data. Using this method we forecast 11 years of monthly averaged data for Solar Cycle 25. Our forecasts show that the upcoming Solar Cycle 25 will have a maximum sunspot number around 106 ± 19.75 and maximum total sunspot area around 1771 ± 381.17. This indicates that the cycle would be slightly weaker than Solar Cycle 24.",

  "abstract": "We have reconstructed longitude-latitude maps of column dust optical depth (CDOD) for Martian year (MY) 34 (5 May 2017- 23 March 2019), using observations by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. Our methodology works by gridding a combination of standard (v5.2) and novel (v5.3.2) estimates of CDOD from MCS limb observations, using an improved \"Iterative Weighted Binning.\" In this work, we have produced four gridded CDOD maps per sol, at different Mars Universal Times. Together with the seasonal and daily variability, the use of several maps per sol also allows us to explore the diurnal variability of CDOD in the MCS dataset, which is shown to be particularly strong during the MY 34 equinoctial global dust event (GDE). In order to understand whether the diurnal variability of CDOD has a physical explanation, and examine the impact of the MY 34 GDE on some aspects of the atmospheric circulation, we have carried out numerical simulations with the \"Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique\" Mars Global Climate Model. We show that the model is able to account for at least part of the observed CDOD diurnal variability. This is particularly true in the southern hemisphere where a strong diurnal wave at the time of the GDE is able to displace dust horizontally as well as vertically. The simulations also clearly show the impact of the MY 34 GDE on the mean meridional circulation and the super-rotating equatorial jet, similarly to the effects of the equinoctial GDE in MY 25.",

  "abstract": "Oxygen is the dominant element in our planetary system. It is therefore remarkable that it shows substantial isotopic diversity both in mass-dependent fractionation, because it is a light element, and in mass-independent fractionation, primarily associated with variation in abundance of <SUP>16</SUP>O. On Earth, the primary variation in isotopic composition is related to temperature-dependent kinetic mass fractionation between hydrosphere and atmosphere. Meteorites provide samples of primitive bodies, that have not experienced melting, and planetesimals that have melted early in their history. Samples of Mars, Vesta, and the Moon are present in the meteorite collections. In meteorites, the cosmochemical fractionation related to the abundance of <SUP>16</SUP>O provides a useful classification scheme. Inclusions in chondrites show a large range in <SUP>16</SUP>O abundances from highly enriched (solar) through to compositions closer to terrestrial (planetary). The variability in <SUP>16</SUP>O appears originally to be related to predissociation and self-shielding of carbon monoxide likely in the primordial molecular cloud. Within the chondrite parent bodies, exchange between <SUP>16</SUP>O-poor fluids and relatively <SUP>16</SUP>O-rich solids created isotopic mixing lines. This model makes specific predictions for isotopic compositions of silicates and water ice throughout the solar system. One prediction, that the Earth should be isotopically heavier than the Sun, appears to be verified. But other tests based on oxygen isotopes within the solar system require either remote analysis or sample return missions. Remote analysis will require new instrumentation and analytical techniques to achieve the precision and accuracy required for three oxygen isotope analysis. Methodologies associated with cavity ring-down spectroscopy appear promising. Sample return appears viable only for the inner solar system including Mars and asteroids. While sample return missions to either Venus or Mercury appear highly challenging, the scientific benefits are immense both in oxygen isotope characterisation, and in a variety of other geochemical analyses. Measurement of three oxygen isotopes throughout the solar system would further our concepts for formation of other solar systems, and give us insight into the general mechanisms of planetary system formation and the role of water in the formation and evolution of the chondrite parent bodies and planets.",

  "abstract": "We investigate the enrichment patterns of several delivery scenarios of the volatiles to the atmospheres of ice giants, having in mind that the only well constrained determination made remotely, namely the carbon abundance measurement, suggests that their envelopes possess highly supersolar metallicities, i.e., close to two orders of magnitude above that of the protosolar nebula. In the framework of the core accretion model, only the delivery of volatiles in solid forms (amorphous ice, clathrates, pure condensates) to these planets can account for the apparent supersolar metallicity of their envelopes. In contrast, because of the inward drift of icy particles through various snowlines, all mechanisms invoking the delivery of volatiles in vapor forms predict subsolar abundances in the envelopes of Uranus and Neptune. Alternatively, even if the disk instability mechanism remains questionable in our solar system, it might be consistent with the supersolar metallicities observed in Uranus and Neptune, assuming the two planets suffered subsequent erosion of their H-He envelopes. The enrichment patterns derived for each delivery scenario considered should be useful to interpret future in situ measurements by atmospheric entry probes.",

  "abstract": "We statistically studied the transport of magnetic flux in and around sunspots using a magnetic-element tracking technique to investigate whether sunspot-decay processes are isotropic. Using this method, we detected moving magnetic features (MMFs). The observed radius of an MMFs region was approximately 1.7 times the sunspot radius; furthermore, the average apparent velocity of MMFs was statistically estimated to be approximately 350 ms-<SUP>1</SUP>. We determined that the leading sunspots transport approximately 5% more magnetic flux to the Equator side than to the Pole side of the sunspots. In addition, the leading sunspots transport approximately 3% more magnetic flux to the back (East) than to the front (West) of the sunspots. On the other hand, the following sunspots do not show the magnetic-flux transport asymmetry. The statistics might not be sufficient for the analysis of the following sunspots. These asymmetries of magnetic flux transport might contribute to the cross-equatorial transport of net magnetic flux, which is an important physical quantity of polar magnetic-field reversal.",

  "abstract": "The impact of gravity waves (GW) on diurnal tides and the global circulation in the middle/upper atmosphere of Mars is investigated using a general circulation model (GCM). We have implemented a stochastic parameterization of non-orographic GW into the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) Mars GCM (LMD-MGCM) following an innovative approach. The source is assumed to be located above typical convective cells (∼250 Pa), and the effect of GW on the circulation and predicted thermal structure above 1 Pa (∼50 km) is analyzed. We focus on the comparison between model simulations and observations by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter during Martian Year 29. MCS data provide the only systematic measurements of the Martian mesosphere up to 80 km to date. The primary effect of GW is to damp the thermal tides by reducing the diurnal oscillation of the meridional and zonal winds. The GW drag reaches magnitudes of the order of 1 m/s/sol above 10&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;-2 Pa in the northern hemisphere winter solstice and produces major changes in the zonal wind field (from tens to hundreds of m/s), while the impact on the temperature field is relatively moderate (10-20 K). It suggests that GW-induced alteration of the meridional flow is the main responsible for the simulated temperature variation. The results also show that with the GW scheme included, the maximum day-night temperature difference due to the diurnal tide is around 10 K, and the peak of the tide is shifted toward lower altitudes, in better agreement with MCS observations.",

  "abstract": "The Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) on board the NASA Juno spacecraft is a dual-band imager and spectrometer in the 2-5 μm range with 9-nm spectral sampling, primarily designed to study the Jovian atmosphere and aurorae. In addition to these goals, JIRAM is used to obtain images and spectra of the Galilean satellites, every time the spacecraft attitude is favorable. Here we present JIRAM images and spectra of Ganymede obtained during the first 4 years of the mission. In particular, on 26 December 2019, during a relatively close passage of Juno with the moon, a dedicated reorientation of the spacecraft was performed to achieve optimized observations of Ganymede by Juno's remote sensing instruments, including JIRAM. In the outbound phase of the flyby, observing the northern polar regions of Ganymede at a distance of roughly 100,000 km, JIRAM collected infrared images and spectra of the surface at a spatial resolution as high as 23 km per pixel, covering high northern latitudes that were scarcely mapped previously. A photometric model of Ganymede reflectance is produced, which diverges from the Lambert model. The spatial distribution of the obtained spectra complements the available coverage of the surface, with particular regard to the 2.0-µm water ice absorption band and, to a lesser extent, to the 4.26-µm spectral feature diagnostic of CO<SUB>2</SUB> trapped in water ice. The water ice distribution is compatible with sputtered-induced water ice grain enrichment at high latitude (&gt;45°). Several minor species (hydrated salts, trapped H<SUB>2</SUB>, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and acids) are also identified in the measured spectra.",

  "abstract": "In its polar layered deposits (PLD), Mars possesses a record of its recent climate, analogous to terrestrial ice sheets containing climate records on Earth. Each PLD is greater than 2 km thick and contains thousands of layers, each containing information on the climatic and atmospheric state during its deposition, creating a climate archive. With detailed measurements of layer composition, it may be possible to extract age, accumulation rates, atmospheric conditions, and surface activity at the time of deposition, among other important parameters; gaining the information would allow us to \"read\" the climate record. Because Mars has fewer complicating factors than Earth (e.g. oceans, biology, and human-modified climate), the planet offers a unique opportunity to study the history of a terrestrial planet's climate, which in turn can teach us about our own planet and the thousands of terrestrial exoplanets waiting to be discovered. <P />During a two-part workshop, the Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) hosted 38 Mars scientists and engineers who focused on determining the measurements needed to extract the climate record contained in the PLD. The group converged on four fundamental questions that must be answered with the goal of interpreting the climate record and finding its history based on the climate drivers. <P />The group then proposed numerous measurements in order to answer these questions and detailed a sequence of missions and architecture to complete the measurements. In all, several missions are required, including an orbiter that can characterize the present climate and volatile reservoirs; a static reconnaissance lander capable of characterizing near surface atmospheric processes, annual accumulation, surface properties, and layer formation mechanism in the upper 50 cm of the PLD; a network of SmallSat landers focused on meteorology for ground truth of the low-altitude orbiter data; and finally, a second landed platform to access ~500 m of layers to measure layer variability through time. This mission architecture, with two landers, would meet the science goals and is designed to save costs compared to a single very capable landed mission. The rationale for this plan is presented below. <P />In this paper we discuss numerous aspects, including our motivation, background of polar science, the climate science that drives polar layer formation, modeling of the atmosphere and climate to create hypotheses for what the layers mean, and terrestrial analogs to climatological studies. Finally, we present a list of measurements and missions required to answer the four major questions and read the climate record.",

  "abstract": "The surface composition of Io is dominated by SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost, plus other chemical species identified or proposed over the past decades by combining Earth-based and space-based observations with laboratory data. Here we discuss spectroscopic data sets of Io obtained by the Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) spectro-imager onboard Juno in nine orbits, spanning a 3-year period. We display average spectral profiles of Io in the 2-5 μm range, and we use band depths derived from those profiles to map the geographic distribution of SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost and other spectral features. This data set allows for an ~22% surface coverage at 58 to 162 km/px and in a broad range of latitudes. Our results confirm the broadly regional SO<SUB>2</SUB>-frost trends already highlighted by Galileo/NIMS. Io's average spectral profiles as well as the mapping of the 4.47-μm band also confirm that SO<SUB>2</SUB> exists in the <SUP>32</SUP>S<SUP>16</SUP>O<SUP>18</SUP>O isotopic form. Surprisingly, the mapping performed by JIRAM shows that the absorption band at 2.1 μm is unrelated to SO<SUB>2</SUB> frost, while we map for the first time the depth of the 2.65-μm band, highlighting regions enriched in this absorber, possibly H<SUB>2</SUB>S. JIRAM data confirm that the 3.92-μm band, likely due to Cl<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>2</SUB>, is largely related to the SO<SUB>2</SUB> distribution. The correlation between Cl<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>2</SUB> and ClSO<SUB>2</SUB>, possibly revealed at 4.62 μm, is not equally clear. The simultaneous presence of two very weak spectral features at 4.55 and 4.62 μm suggests that nitrile compounds or tholins may also be present on the surface.",

  "abstract": "The chronology of the moons of Saturn, especially Titan, has been limited by a lack of strong constraints on the cratering rate, low number statistics for small-N counts of large-diameter craters, and uncertainty about whether impactors are mostly heliocentric impactors orbiting the Sun or planetocentric impactors orbiting Saturn itself. Here, I propose to address these three problems. Instead of looking for an absolute cratering rate, I focus on the relative crater densities, calculating scaling relationships between the moons. I update crater analysis methodology by numerically modeling probability density functions of the uncertainty of crater density, enabling me to accurately assess the error of even single-crater observations. Using these updated statistics, I show how the heliocentric cratering model leads to a dramatic increase in relative crater density for Mimas, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus with distance from Saturn. Under this model, the surface age of Titan is probably older than the cratered plains of Mimas—implying a very low erosion rate and minimal endogenic resurfacing on Titan. I explore possible explanations, concluding that the likeliest explanation is planetocentric cratering, although saturation effects cannot be ruled out. Under the planetocentric model, the relative crater densities of the cratered plains of Mimas, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus are all very close, with the relative crater density at Titan between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude lower. Under planetocentric cratering, the cratering rate on Titan allows for vigorous erosion and endogenic resurfacing.",

  "abstract": "The effects of solar flares on the upper atmosphere of Mars are large but poorly constrained by observations. These effects are an important aspect of the response of Mars to space weather events and may also influence the escape of volatiles from Mars, particularly in the solar system's early history. Here we report the effects of the X8.2 flare on 10 September 2017 on the density and composition of the thermosphere of Mars. This analysis uses neutral number densities of He, O, N<SUB>2</SUB>, CO, Ar, and CO<SUB>2</SUB> from the MAVEN Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS). From these observations, we investigate how the enhanced solar irradiance during the flare produced changes in the neutral upper atmosphere of Mars due to atmospheric heating and photochemistry. Flare-produced photochemical changes in the neutral thermosphere of Mars have been previously implied but not quantified. We find that at fixed altitudes, the number densities of all species barring He increase and the O/CO<SUB>2</SUB> ratio decreases by ∼15-45%, indicating thermal expansion. However, when viewed at fixed total number densities, the densities of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and Ar decrease, and the O/CO<SUB>2</SUB> ratio increases by up to a factor of ∼3. The photodissociation of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is one photochemical process that produces changes resembling those identified. The quantified changes will help to constrain the shifting chemical makeup of the upper atmosphere due to these impactful flare events and may aid modeling of flare behavior and the impact of flares on the evolution of the Martian climate.",

  "abstract": "Space weather events may cause damage to several types of technologies, including aviation, satellites, oil and gas industries, and electrical systems, leading to economic and commercial losses. Solar flares belong to the most significant events, and refer to sudden radiation releases that can affect the Earth's atmosphere within a few hours or minutes. Therefore, it is worth designing high-performance systems for forecasting such events. Although in the literature there are many approaches for flare forecasting, there is still a lack of consensus concerning the techniques used for designing these systems. Seeking to establish some standardization while designing flare predictors, in this study we propose a novel methodology for designing such predictors, further validated with extreme gradient boosting tree classifiers and time series. This methodology relies on the following well-defined machine learning based pipeline: (i) univariate feature selection provided with the F-score, (ii) randomized hyperparameters search and optimization, (iii) imbalanced data treatment through cost function analysis of classifiers, (iv) adjustment of cut-off point of classifiers seeking to find the optimal relationship between hit rate and precision, and (v) evaluation under operational settings. To verify our methodology effectiveness, we designed and evaluated three proof-of-concept models for forecasting flares with an X class larger than C up to 72 hours ahead. Compared to baseline models, those models were able to significantly increase their scores of true skill statistics (TSS) under operational forecasting scenarios by 0.37 (predicting flares in the next 24 hours), 0.13 (predicting flares within 24 - 48 hours), and 0.36 (predicting flares within 48 - 72 hours). Besides increasing the TSS, the methodology also led to significant increases in the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, corroborating that we improved the positive and negative recalls of classifiers while decreasing the number of false alarms.",

  "abstract": "Rossby waves arise in thin layers within fluid regions of stars and planets. These global wave-like patterns occur due to the variation in Coriolis forces with latitude. In the past several years observational evidence has indicated that there are also Rossby waves in the Sun. Although Rossby waves have been detected in the Sun's photosphere and corona, they most likely originate in the solar tachocline, the sharp shear layer at the base of the solar convection zone, where the differential rotation driven by convection transitions to the solidly rotating radiative interior. These waves differ from their Earth's counterparts by being strongly modified by toroidal magnetic fields in the solar tachocline. Recent simulations of magnetohydrodynamics of tachocline Rossby waves and magnetic fields are demonstrated to produce strong \"tachocline nonlinear oscillations,\" which have periods similar to those observed in the solar atmosphere—enhanced periods of solar activity, or \"seasons\"—occurring at intervals between six months and two years. These seasonal/subseasonal bursts produce the strongest eruptive space weather events. Thus, a key to forecasting the timing, amplitude, and location of future activity bursts, and hence space weather events, could lie in our ability to forecast the phase and amplitude of Rossby waves and associated tachocline nonlinear oscillations. Accurately forecasting the properties of solar Rossby waves and their impact on space weather will require linking surface activity observations to the magnetohydrodynamics of tachocline Rossby waves, using modern data assimilation techniques. Both short-term (hours to days) and long-term (decadal to millennial) forecasts of space weather and climate are now being made. We highlight in this article the potential of solar Rossby waves for forecasting space weather on intermediate time scales, of several weeks to months up to a few years ahead.",

Nightside IUVS observations before and throughout this GDS showed the altitude of CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorption of Lyman-α photons in the thermosphere to increase by 4.5±1.0 km on 8 June 2018. This shift is attributed to an increase of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> density by a factor 1.9±0.2 at 110 km due to the heating of the lower atmosphere. These nightside observations, not previously used to study dust storms, in an altitude range not sampled by other instruments, are consistent with dayside MAVEN observations and allow for more comprehensive determination of the global changes produced by the GDS on the Martian thermosphere.",

  "abstract": "A commonly used shape model for the giant plants of Jupiter and Saturn is an oblate ellipsoid, a simplified model of the equipotential shape. The ellipsoidal shape models were originally derived from radio occultation data and gravity data after the Voyager flybys in 1979. Through precise Doppler tracking of NASA's Juno and Cassini spacecraft telecommunications links, zonal coefficients in a spherical harmonic expansion of the gravity field of Jupiter and Saturn have been resolved to degree 10, including the detection of nonzero odd zonal harmonics, which have been interpreted as differential rotation in the atmosphere for both planets. In this work, we construct the equipotential surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn using the recently measured gravity fields determined by Juno through perijove 8 and Cassini through end of mission. For both planets, even zonal harmonics dominate the equipotential shape, differing from the reference ellipsoid up to ~32 km at Jupiter and ~125 km at Saturn in the midlatitude regions. Saturn's internal rotation period estimated with ring seismology produces a shape that is fully consistent with the Pioneer and Voyager radio occultation measurements, and Jupiter's shape is fully consistent with the Pioneer and Voyager radio occultation measurements. With current equipotential theory, the recent analysis of the depth of the deep zonal flow on Jupiter and Saturn cannot fully be explained by the shape from current radio occultation measurements; additional occultation measurements and reanalysis of the Pioneer and Voyager radio occultations and will be useful for further constraining the shape of the planets.",

  "abstract": "The present atmosphere of Venus contains almost no water, but recent measurements indicate that in its early history, Venus had an Earth-like ocean. Understanding how the Venusian atmosphere evolved is important not only for Venus itself but also for understanding the evolution of other planetary atmospheres. In this study, we quantify the escape rates of oxygen ions from the present Venus to infer the past of the Venusian atmosphere. We show that an extrapolation of the current escape rates back in time leads to the total escape of 0.02-0.6 m of a global equivalent layer of water. This implies that the loss of ions to space, inferred from the present state, cannot account for the loss of an historical Earth-like ocean. We find that the O<SUP>+</SUP> escape rate increases with solar wind energy flux, where more energy available leads to a higher escape rate. Oppositely, the escape rate decreases slightly with increased extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV) flux, though the small variation of EUV flux over the measured solar cycle may explain the weak dependency. These results indicate that there is not enough energy transferred from the solar wind to Venus' upper atmosphere that can lead to the escape of the atmosphere over the past 3.9 billion years. This means that the Venusian atmosphere did not have as much water in its atmosphere as previously assumed or the present-day escape rates do not represent the historical escape rates at Venus. Otherwise, some other mechanisms have acted to more effectively remove the water from the Venusian atmosphere.",

  "abstract": "The behavior of sunspots is governed by the magnetic dynamo acting deep within the convection zone of the Sun. Therefore, knowledge of sunspot physical characteristics and how they evolve in time during a solar cycle can help to improve our understanding of the solar magnetic behavior. This work analyzes the physical characteristics of sunspots during the Solar Activity Cycle 23, detected using computer vision techniques. The main goal is to derive the relationships between sunspot properties. Images in visible light and magnetograms of the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) were used to detect sunspots and to extract their characteristics such as area, intensity (or temperature), and magnetic field magnitude. A total of 32,223 sunspots were analyzed, with longitudes between -40<SUP>∘</SUP> and 40<SUP>∘</SUP>, throughout the entire Solar Cycle 23, from May 1996 through April 2008. These spots fell mainly into three categories. Most sunspots (85%) did not exhibit a well defined umbra, with average intensities larger than 0.657 relative to disk center, which corresponds to temperatures greater than 5200 K. A second group comprising less than 12% of the spots, was cooler (temperature less than 5200 K) and with more intense magnetic fields (2000 - 4000 G) and mostly presented a well defined umbra. Lastly, only 3% of the spots had large areas and strong magnetic fields with complex umbrae, but intermediate temperatures. The temporal behavior of sunspot physical characteristics throughout the 11 year cycle and the relationships between them were verified. Sunspot physical properties presented variations over time during Solar Cycle 23, such that larger, cooler sunspots with stronger magnetic fields occurred more frequently during periods of maximum activity. Linear correlations were found regarding the logarithm of the area and the intensity with extreme magnetic field, and of the temperature (or intensity) with the area; whereas a quadratic relation was found between magnetic field and temperature of spots.",

  "abstract": "Total solar eclipse (TSE) coronal large- and small-scale events were reported in the historical literature but a definite synoptic coverage was missing for studying a relationship with the more general magnetic context of the solar-disk. We here analyze temporal changes in the solar corona before, during, and after the total solar eclipse on 21 August 2017 from a set of ground-based and of space-borne observations. High-quality ground-based white-light (W-L) observations and a deep image processing allow us to reveal these changes for the first time with a fraction of a minute temporal resolution. Displacements of a number of fine coronal features were measured for the first time at these small radial distances, using a diffraction-limited instrument at a single site. The comparison with space-based observations, including observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission, showed that the features belong to a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) propagating through the corona with the nearly constant speed of 250 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our TSE images provide the same typical velocity as measured at a distance of one solar radius from the surface. The event was initiated by coronal dynamics manifested by a prominence eruption that started just before the eclipse observations and an ascent of a U-shaped structure visible in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171 Å channel, which we assume as the lower part of a coronal cavity. The prominence material was observed draining down towards the chromosphere along the prominence arch. While the prominence disappears in the STEREO-A field-of-view at the height of about 6' above the limb, the corresponding flux rope seems to continue towards the outer corona and produces the slow CME with turbulent motion. The overall mass of the moving features is evaluated based on absolute photometrical data extracted from our best W-L eclipse image.",

  "abstract": "Previous observations have shown that, during Martian dust storms, the peak of the ionosphere rises in altitude. Observational studies of this type, however, have been extremely limited. Using 13 years of ionospheric peak altitude data from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding instrument on Mars Express, we study how the peak altitude responded to dust storms during six different Mars years (MY). The peak altitude increased ∼10-15 km during all six events, which include a local dust storm (MY 33), three regional dust storms (MYs 27, 29, and 32), and two global dust storms (MYs 28 and 34). The peak altitude's orbit-to-orbit variability was exceptionally large at the apexes of the MY 29 and MY 32 dust seasons and dramatically increased during the MY 28 and MY 34 global dust storms. We conclude that dust storms significantly increase upper atmospheric variability, which suggests that they enhance dynamical processes that couple the lower and upper atmospheres, such as upward propagating gravity waves or atmospheric tides.",

  "abstract": "Forbush decreases (FDs), which are short-term drops in the flux of galactic cosmic rays, are caused by the shielding from strong and/or turbulent magnetic structures in the solar wind, especially interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their associated shocks, as well as corotating interaction regions. Such events can be observed at Earth, for example, using neutron monitors, and also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the surface of Mars with the Radiation Assessment Detector instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory. They are often used as a proxy for detecting the arrival of ICMEs or corotating interaction regions, especially when sufficient in situ solar wind measurements are not available. We compare the properties of FDs observed at Earth and Mars, focusing on events produced by ICMEs. We find that FDs at both locations show a correlation between their total amplitude and the maximum hourly decrease, but with different proportionality factors. We explain this difference using theoretical modeling approaches and suggest that it is related to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route from Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening factor to be between about 1.5 and 1.9, agreeing with our theoretical considerations. This factor is also in line with previous measurements of the sheath evolution closer to the Sun.",

  "abstract": "An extensive analysis of Cassini Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) and Charge Energy Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) measurements of ~6-231 keV ion anisotropies acquired during selected spin and stare periods for nearly all mission orbits has been completed. Based on this analysis, we find that the computed azimuthal speed of Saturn's magnetodisk plasma increases within the inner and middle magnetosphere. Beyond the orbit of Titan, in the magnetotail, the calculated rotation speed remains roughly constant with increasing distance from Saturn. The component of convection parallel to Saturn's spin axis is smaller and on average nearly zero. The radial speed of plasma shows distinct local time dependence and increases outward with increasing distance down the magnetotail. The magnetodisk flow remains primarily azimuthal to large distances, indicating the plasma is still under the influence of Saturn as it transits across the nightside. Tailward flows have been observed in the region near the dawn and dusk magnetotail flanks. The plasma flow in the predawn quadrant is much more disorganized than that in the premidnight quadrant. The hydrogen and oxygen hot ion temperatures increase with decreasing distance to Saturn. Some plasma evidently escapes into a dusk boundary layer at the dusk magnetotail flank, while the remaining plasma primarily moves across the magnetotail and is entrained into the flow of a boundary layer at the dawn flank of the magnetotail. When scaled to the magnetopause standoff distance and corotation fraction, the convection speed of plasma in the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn is similarly organized.",

  "abstract": "In 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto and its moon Charon, providing the first clear look at Charon's surface. New Horizons images revealed an ancient surface, a large, intricate canyon system, and many fractures, among other geologic features. Here, we assess whether tidal stresses played a significant role in the formation of Charon's tensile fractures. Although presently in a circular orbit, most scenarios for Charon's orbital evolution include an eccentric orbit for some period of time and possibly an internal ocean. Past work has shown that these conditions could have generated stresses comparable in magnitude to other tidally fractured moons, such as Europa and Enceladus. However, we find no correlation between observed fracture orientations and those predicted to form due to eccentricity driven tidal stress. It, thus, seems more likely that Charon's orbit circularized before its ocean froze and that either tidal stresses alone were insufficient to fracture the surface or subsequent resurfacing removed these ancient fractures.",

  "abstract": "Over several decades UCSD has developed and continually updated a time dependent iterative three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction technique to provide global heliospheric parameters - density, velocity, and component magnetic fields. For expediency, this has used a kinematic model as a kernel to provide a fit to either interplanetary scintillation (IPS) or Thomson-scattering observations. This technique has been used in near real time over this period, employing Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Japan IPS data to predict the propagation of these parameters throughout the inner heliosphere. We have extended the 3-D reconstruction analysis to include other IPS Stations around the Globe in a Worldwide Interplanetary Scintillation Stations (WIPSS) Network. In addition, we also plan to resurrect the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) Thomson-scattering analysis as a basis for 3-D analysis to be used by the latest NASA Small Explorer heliospheric imagers of the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission, the All Sky Heliospheric Imager (ASHI), and other modern wide-field imagers. Better data require improved Heliospheric modeling that incorporates non-radial transport of heliospheric flows, and shock processes. Looking ahead to this, we have constructed an interface between the 3-D reconstruction tomography and 3-D MHD models, and currently include the ENLIL model as a kernel in the reconstructions to provide this fit. In short, we are now poised to provide all of these innovations in a next step: to include them for planned ground-based and spacecraft instruments, all to be combined into a truly global 3-D heliospheric system which utilizes these aspects in their data and modeling.",

  "abstract": "We estimate the role of heat flux from hot magnetic loops and open flux tubes into the surrounding corona as a possible source of heating of the corona. We show that hot magnetic-flux tubes (Type-II spicules) provide a more efficient source of coronal heating than hot magnetic loops, as the closed magnetic structure of a loop substantially restricts the heat flux into the corona. In order to compensate for radiation and thermal-conduction losses, approximately 10<SUP>4</SUP> Type-II spicules with a temperature of several million Kelvin are required, which is about 1% of the number of spicules simultaneously observed on the solar disk. Our analysis shows that the principal source of energy that heats the coronal plasma is photospheric convection, which generates electric currents of about 10<SUP>10</SUP> - 10<SUP>12</SUP> A in magnetic loops and spicules. Dissipation of the currents increases significantly in the partially ionized plasma, i.e. when ion-atom collisions and the associated Cowling conductivity occur. This results in two important effects: heating of plasma in magnetic structures up to several million Kelvin, and ejection of hot plasma from open magnetic-flux tubes to the corona, replenishing the corona with hot plasma. The ejection of hot plasma results from the heating of the spicule foot-point by electric-current dissipation, which grows with a sporadic increase in the velocity of photospheric convection, for example, due to five-minute oscillations or the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. As a result, the rate of heating the photospheric foot-points of the spicules by ring currents exceeds radiation losses, which leads to a jump in the pressure gradient and the ejection of hot plasma into the corona from the open tips of the magnetic-flux tubes.",

  "abstract": "The search for molecular biosignatures at the surface of Mars is complicated by an intense irradiation in the mid- and near- ultraviolet (UV) spectral range for several reasons: (i) many astrobiologically relevant molecules are electronically excited by efficient absorption of UV radiation and rapidly undergo photochemical reactions; (ii) even though the penetration depth of UV radiation is limited, aeolian erosion continually exposes fresh material to radiation; and (iii) UV irradiation generates strong oxidants such as perchlorates that can penetrate deep into soils and cause subsurface oxidative degradation of organics. As a consequence, it is crucial to investigate the effects of UV radiation on organic molecules embedded in mineral matrices mimicking the martian soil, in order to validate hypotheses about the nature of the organic compounds detected so far at the surface of Mars by the NASA Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover, as well as organics that will be possibly found by the next rover missions Mars 2020 (NASA) and ExoMars 2022 (ESA-Roscosmos). In addition, studying the alteration of possible molecular biosignatures in the martian environment will help to redefine the molecular targets for life detection missions and devise suitable detection methods. Here we report the results of mid- and near-UV irradiation experiments of Mars soil analog samples obtained adsorbing relevant organic molecules on a clay mineral that is quite common on Mars, i.e. montmorillonite, doped with 1 wt% of magnesium perchlorate. Specifically, we chose to investigate the photostability of a plausible precursor of the chlorohydrocarbons detected on Mars by the Curiosity rover, namely phthalic acid, along with the biomarkers of extant life L-phenylalanine and L-glutamic acid, which are proteomic amino acids, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate, which is a nucleic acid component. We monitored the degradation of these molecules adsorbed on montmorillonite through in situ spectroscopic analysis, investigating the reflectance properties of the samples in the Near InfraRed spectral region. Such spectroscopic characterization of molecular alteration products provides support for two upcoming robotic missions to Mars that will employ NIR spectroscopy to look for molecular biosignatures, through the instruments SuperCam on board Mars 2020, ISEM, Ma_Miss and MicrOmega on board ExoMars 2022.",

  "abstract": "The ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are fundamentally different from the gas giant and terrestrial planets. Though ice giants represent the most common size of exoplanet and possess characteristics that challenge our understanding of the way our solar system formed and evolved, they remain the only class of planetary object without a dedicated spacecraft mission. The inclusion of a Uranus orbiter as the third highest priority Flagship mission in the NASA Planetary Science Decadal Survey \"Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022\" indicates a high level of support for exploration of the ice giants by the planetary science community. However, given the substantial costs associated with a flagship mission, it is critical to explore lower cost options if we intend to visit Uranus within an ideal launch window of 2029-2034 when a Jupiter gravity assist becomes available. In this paper, we describe the Quest to Uranus to Explore Solar System Theories (QUEST), a New Frontiers class Uranus orbiter mission concept study performed at the 30th Annual NASA/JPL Planetary Science Summer Seminar. The proposed QUEST platform is a spin-stabilized spacecraft designed to undergo highly elliptical, polar orbits around Uranus during a notional one-year primary science mission. The proposed major science goals of the mission are (1) to use Uranus as a natural laboratory to better understand the dynamos that drive magnetospheres in the solar system and beyond and (2) to identify the energy transport mechanisms in Uranus' magnetic, atmospheric, and interior environments in contrast with the other giant planets. With substantial mass, power, and cost margins, this mission concept demonstrates a compelling, feasible option for a New Frontiers Uranus orbiter mission.",

  "abstract": "Jupiter's upper atmosphere is ∼700 K hotter than predicted based on solar extreme ultraviolet heating alone. The reason for this still remains a mystery and is known as the \"energy crisis.\" It is thought that the interaction between Jupiter and its dynamic magnetosphere plays a vital role in heating its atmosphere to the observed temperatures. Here, we present a new model of Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere-coupled system where we couple a three-dimensional atmospheric general circulation model to an axisymmetric magnetosphere model. We find that the model temperatures are on average ∼60 K, with a maximum of ∼200 K, hotter than the model's two-dimensional predecessor making our high-latitude temperatures comparable to the lower limit of observations. Stronger meridional winds now transport more heat from the auroral region to the equator increasing the equatorial temperatures. However, despite this increase, the modeled equatorial temperatures are still hundreds of kelvins colder than observed. We use this model as an intermediate step toward a three-dimensional atmospheric model coupled to a realistic magnetosphere model with zonal and radial variation.",

  "abstract": "For the first time for any planetary body other than the Earth, the free wobble of the pole called the Chandler wobble has been detected for Mars with a period of 206.9 ± 0.5 days and amplitude of 10 cm from radio tracking observations of Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), in order of decreasing sensitivity. The motion of the rotation pole location on the surface of Mars, or polar motion, is observed using two different approaches: (1) joint global estimates of Mars' orientation and its gravity field and (2) time series solutions of C<SUB>21</SUB> and S<SUB>21</SUB>. For Mars interior models, the Chandler wobble period is combined with other measurements including the moments of inertia from our estimated precession rate ψ˙=-7603.9±1.3 mas/year and tidal Love number k<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.169 ± 0.006. The Chandler wobble period constrains the rheology of the Martian mantle and in particular its long-term frequency dependence.",

  "abstract": "At Jupiter, tail reconnection is thought to be driven by an internal mass loading and release process called the Vasyliunas cycle. Galileo data have shown hundreds of reconnection events occurring in Jupiter's magnetotail. Here we present a survey of reconnection events observed by Juno during its first 16 orbits of Jupiter (July 2016-October 2018). The events are identified using Juno magnetic field data, which facilitates comparison to the Vogt et al. (2010, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JA015098\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JA015098</A>) survey of reconnection events from Galileo magnetometer data, but we present data from Juno's other particle and fields instruments for context. We searched for field dipolarizations or reversals and found 232 reconnection events in the Juno data, most of which featured an increase in |B<SUB>θ</SUB>|, the magnetic field meridional component, by a factor of 3 over background values. We found that most properties of the Juno reconnection events, like their spatial distribution and duration, are comparable to Galileo, including the presence of a ~3-day quasi-periodicity in the recurrence of Juno tail reconnection events and in Juno JEDI, JADE, and Waves data. However, unlike with Galileo we were unable to clearly define a statistical x-line separating planetward and tailward Juno events. A preliminary analysis of plasma velocities during five magnetic field reconnection events showed that the events were accompanied by fast radial flows, confirming our interpretation of these magnetic signatures as reconnection events. We anticipate that a future survey covering other Juno datasets will provide additional insight into the nature of tail reconnection at Jupiter.",

  "abstract": "Using Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) data, we find, classify, and analyze transient dynamic pressure enhancements in the magnetosheath (jets) from May 2015 to May 2019. A classification algorithm is presented, using in situ MMS data to classify jets (N=8,499) into different categories according to their associated angle between interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the bow shock normal vector (θ<SUB>Bn</SUB>). Jets appearing for θ<SUB>Bn</SUB> &lt; 45 are referred to as quasi-parallel, while jets appearing for θ<SUB>Bn</SUB> &gt; 45 as quasi-perpendicular jets. Furthermore, we define those jets that occur at the boundaries between quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath as boundary jets. Finally, encapsulated jets are jet-like structures with similar characteristics to quasi-parallel jets while the surrounding plasma is of quasi-perpendicular nature. We present the first statistical results of such a classification and provide comparative statistics for each class. Furthermore, we investigate correlations between jet quantities. Quasi-parallel jets have the highest dynamic pressure while occurring more often than quasi-perpendicular jets. The infrequent quasi-perpendicular jets have a much smaller duration, velocity, and density and are therefore relatively weaker. We conclude that quasi-parallel and boundary jets have similar properties and are unlikely to originate from different generation mechanisms. Regarding the encapsulated jets, we suggest that they are a special subset of quasi-parallel jets originating from the flanks of the bow shock, for large IMF cone angles although a relation to flux transfer events (FTEs) and magnetospheric plasma is also possible. Our results support existing generation theories, such as the bow shock ripple and SLAMS-associated mechanisms while indicating that other factors may contribute as well.",

(2019). This change reduces the abundance of cyanoacetylene HC<SUB>3</SUB>N close to the measured ALMA upper limit (Lellouch et al., 2017), increases the model abundances of H<SUB>2</SUB> and C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB> by factors of 1.3, and reduces the abundances of H and C<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB> by factors of 1.3, while other species are changed less than 5% in the model. The predicted abundance of atomic hydrogen agrees with that derived from the observed Lyman-beta emission by Steffl et al. (2020). <P />The observed HC<SUP>14</SUP>N/HC<SUP>15</SUP>N &gt; 125 on Pluto (Lellouch et al., 2017) looks puzzling compared to HC<SUP>14</SUP>N/HC<SUP>15</SUP>N = 60 on Titan. Our analysis confirms the predissociation of N<SUB>2</SUB> at 80-100 nm as the main process of nitrogen isotope fractionation. The observed twofold difference is partially caused by the diffusive depletion of the heavy isotope in HCN and in the predissociation of N<SUB>2</SUB>. On Pluto, the mean altitudes of HCN and predissociation of N<SUB>2</SUB> are 500 and 860 km, well above the homopause at 96 km. On Titan, observations of HC<SUP>14</SUP>N/HC<SUP>15</SUP>N refer to 90-460 km (Vinatier et al., 2007), the predissociation occurs near 985 km, both below the homopause at 1000 km, and diffusive depletion does not occur. Therefore the observed limit corresponds to <SUP>14</SUP>N/<SUP>15</SUP>N &gt; 253 for N<SUB>2</SUB> in the lower atmosphere and <SUP>14</SUP>N/<SUP>15</SUP>N &gt; 228 in the upper layers of the N<SUB>2</SUB> ice. These limits reflect the conditions on Pluto in the last two million years, which is the lifetime of N<SUB>2</SUB> in Pluto's atmosphere with the current N<SUB>2</SUB> loss of 37.5 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP> Byr<SUP>-1</SUP> primarily for photodestruction. The calculated isotope fractionation factor of 1.96 accounts for the formation and condensation of nitriles, diffusive separation, and fractionation in thermal escape. Variations of <SUP>14</SUP>N/<SUP>15</SUP>N in the N<SUB>2</SUB> ice are related to the evolution of the solar EUV, mixing processes in the N<SUB>2</SUB> ice, and possible periods of hydrodynamic escape, which are poorly known and not considered here.",

  "abstract": "The sudden exposure to energetic protons from solar energetic particle (SEP) events beyond the Earth's magnetosphere and en route to and from Mars can, in extreme cases, lead to acute radiation sickness, an impairing, mission-endangering condition for astronauts. Timely warnings of their impending occurrence may significantly reduce radiation exposure by allowing astronauts sufficient time to move to a radiation shelter. The Relativistic Electron Alert System for Exploration (REleASE) has been developed to provide such early warnings for the Earth-Moon system by exploiting the time difference of the arrival of SEP electrons and ions at 1 AU. This study explores the effectiveness of REleASE in a scenario that assumes a two-element system, one placed at Earth-Sun L1 and the other at Mars-Sun L1. This system would exploit the Hohmann-Parker effect, the circumstance that a spacecraft remains close to the heliospheric magnetic field lines that connect Earth and/or Mars with the Sun while in the Hohmann transfer orbit. We investigate whether the two-element REleASE system would provide advance warnings for all phases of a mission to and from Mars. In the absence of adequate long-term SEP measurements beyond Earth orbit, we employ 2-D modeling of SEP injection and transport for SEP exposure scenarios, in which the best magnetic connections and thus most rapid flux increases of protons occur at exploration vehicle. We show the relative timing of alert occurrence and arrival of harmful ions at the spacecraft throughout a round-trip human mission to Mars.",

  "abstract": "As an important proxy of the solar extreme ultraviolet radiation from the upper chromosphere and lower corona, the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7) has a wide range of applications in models of the thermosphere and ionosphere. Forecasting F10.7 has already become a routine business in space weather services. In this study, we analyzed the predictive power of autoregressive (AR) models with orders p =15 - 1005, a training sample length L =22 years, and a running time window w =50 days on the daily F10.7, during the last two solar cycles (Solar Cycles 23 and 24) at the forecast steps n =1 - 81 days. The main conclusions are as follows. (i) The mean forecast error (δ ‾) at the n th day or over N days is minimum at an optimal order p<SUB>o</SUB>, which tends to increase as n or N increases. (ii) δ ‾ is positively related to both n and F10.7. The large error during the maximum period is the result of the large daily variation in F10.7, mainly due to the appearance and decay of active regions, especially the eruptions of solar flares. (iii) The solar cycle can be divided into six parts in the rising order of δ ‾: (a) closing part of the declining phase, (b) initial rising phase, (c) middle declining phase, (iv) closing rising phase, (v) middle rising phase, and (f) initial declining phase. (iv) The AR model at p<SUB>o</SUB> is not inferior to other techniques. (v) p<SUB>o</SUB> is uncorrelated to the autocorrelation coefficient, and (vi) δ ‾ is minimum at a certain L.",

  "abstract": "Solar activity, ranging from the background solar wind to energetic coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is the main driver of the conditions in the interplanetary space and in the terrestrial space environment, known as space weather. A better understanding of the Sun-Earth connection carries enormous potential to mitigate negative space weather effects with economic and social benefits. Effective space weather forecasting relies on data and models. In this paper, we discuss some of the most used space weather models, and propose suitable locations for data gathering with space weather purposes. We report on the application of Representer analysis (RA) and Domain of Influence (DOI) analysis to three models simulating different stages of the Sun-Earth connection: the OpenGGCM and Tsyganenko models, focusing on solar wind - magnetosphere interaction, and the PLUTO model, used to simulate CME propagation in interplanetary space. Our analysis is promising for space weather purposes for several reasons. First, we obtain quantitative information about the most useful locations of observation points, such as solar wind monitors. For example, we find that the absolute values of the DOI are extremely low in the magnetospheric plasma sheet. Since knowledge of that particular sub-system is crucial for space weather, enhanced monitoring of the region would be most beneficial. Second, we are able to better characterize the models. Although the current analysis focuses on spatial rather than temporal correlations, we find that time-independent models are less useful for Data Assimilation activities than time-dependent models. Third, we take the first steps towards the ambitious goal of identifying the most relevant heliospheric parameters for modelling CME propagation in the heliosphere, their arrival time, and their geoeffectiveness at Earth.",

  "abstract": "The magnetosheath (MSH) plasma turbulence depends on the structure and properties of the bow shock (BS). Under quasi-parallel (Q_{||}) and quasi-perpendicular (Q_{\\perp}) BS configurations the electromagnetic field and plasma quantities possess quite distinct behavior, e.g. being highly variable and structured in the Q_{||} case. Theory and numerical simulations suggest that plasma turbulence generates coherent structures, e.g. current sheets. Previous studies have reported abundance of thin current sheets (with typical scales of the order of the plasma kinetic scales) in the Q_{||} MSH, associated with magnetic reconnection, plasma heating and acceleration. Here we use multipoint observations from Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission, where for the first time a comparative study of discontinuities and current sheets in both MSH geometries at very small spacecraft separation (of the order of the ion inertial length) is performed. In Q_{||} MSH the current density distribution is characterized by a heavy tail, populated by strong currents. There is high correlation between these currents and the discontinuities associated with large magnetic shears. Whilst, this seems not to be the case in Q_\\perp MSH, where current sheets are virtually absent. We also investigate the effect of the discontinuities on the scaling of electromagnetic fluctuations in the MHD range and in the beginning of the kinetic range. There are two (one) orders of magnitude higher power in the magnetic (electric) field fluctuations in the Q_{||} MSH, as well as different spectral scaling, in comparison to the Q_{\\perp} MSH configurations. This is an indication that the incoming solar wind turbulence is completely locally reorganized behind Q_{\\perp} BS while even though modified by Q_{||} BS geometry, the downstream turbulence properties are still reminiscent to the ones upstream, the latter confirming previous observations. We show also that the two geometries are associated with different temperature anisotropies, plasma beta and compressibility, where the Q_{\\perp} MSH is unstable to mostly mirror mode plasma instability, while the Q_{||} MSH is unstable also to oblique and parallel fire-hose, and ion-cyclotron instabilities.",

  "abstract": "Martian meteorites are the only direct samples from Mars, thus far. Currently, there are a total of 262 individual samples originating from at least 11 ejection events. Geochemical analyses, through techniques that are also used on terrestrial rocks, provide fundamental insights into the bulk composition, differentiation and evolution, mantle heterogeneity, and role of secondary processes, such as aqueous alteration and shock, on Mars. Martian meteorites display a wide range in mineralogy and chemistry, but are predominantly basaltic in composition. Over the past 6 years, the number of martian meteorites recovered has almost doubled allowing for studies that evaluate these meteorites as suites of igneous rocks. However, the martian meteorites represent a biased sampling of the surface of Mars with unknown ejection locations. The geology of Mars cannot be unraveled solely by analyzing these meteorites. Rocks analyzed by rovers on the surface of Mars are of distinct composition to the meteorites, highlighting the importance of Mars missions, especially sample return. The Mars 2020 Perseverance rover will collect and cache—for eventual return to Earth—over 30 diverse surface samples from Jezero crater. These returned samples will allow for Earth-based state-of-the-art analyses on diverse martian rocks with known field context. The complementary study of returned samples and meteorites will help to constrain the evolution of the martian interior and surface. Here, we review recent findings and advances in the study of martian meteorites and examine how returned samples would complement and enhance our knowledge of Mars.",

  "abstract": "Solar wind discontinuities carry intense transient currents and significantly contribute to the turbulent spectrum and plasma heating. The most-investigated characteristics of these discontinuities are the magnetic field configuration and the current density, whereas plasma characteristics attract less attention. In this study, we utilize eight years of ARTEMIS spacecraft observations in the solar wind to investigate plasma density, velocity, and temperature variations across discontinuities. We also consider the role of discontinuities in the development of Earth's magnetospheric perturbations. We show that observed discontinuities can be separated into two groups: (i) discontinuities with weak plasma density variations and a significant correlation between the solar wind and Alfvén velocities, (ii) discontinuities with significant variations of plasma density and temperature. For most discontinuities, observed density variations anti-correlate with temperature variations, but larger density/temperature variations correspond to stronger current densities. Time intervals characterized by increased occurrence rate of solar wind discontinuities correspond to enhanced geomagnetic activity in the Earth's magnetosphere as characterized by geomagnetic indices.",

Cavities appear to be common at Venus, and their properties appear to be very similar to those at Earth. Foreshock cavities appear to be observed preferentially in fast solar wind and when the interplanetary magnetic field is \"radial\" (parallel to the Sun-planet line).

  "abstract": "The melt zone in the volcanically active satellite Io plays a key role in diverse processes such as volcanism, heat transfer, tidal dissipation, and the orbital evolution of the Galilean satellites in the Laplace resonance. Information on the melt distribution, the degree of partial melt, and the possible existence of a global magma ocean has been derived from Galileo magnetic induction measurements, volcanic eruption temperatures, and Hubble Space Telescope auroral spot observations but is currently inconclusive. Here, we calculate the libration amplitude of Io for a diverse set of internal structure models and show that Io's libration can provide insight into the existence of a global magma ocean and into the thickness and rigidity of the crust above it. The diurnal libration amplitude of Io is several times larger if Io has a magma ocean instead of a partial melt asthenosphere and can reach values of above 1 km, making it easily observable for spacecraft flying close by Io on multiple occasions. It also strongly increases with decreasing crustal thickness and increases significantly with increasing rigidity. We demonstrate that the combination of observations of the libration amplitude and the tidal Love number k<SUB>2</SUB> will allow estimating the rigidity and thickness of the crust separately, which is impossible with only one of the quantities observed.",

  "abstract": "Based on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) observations, we have analyzed the role of the crustal magnetic field on ion loss driven by the direct interaction of the solar wind with the Mars ionosphere. Crustal magnetic fields significantly attenuate the ion ionospheric motions and raise the flux of returning ions. On the other hand, since the ion densities in the ionosphere with strong crustal field are significantly higher than in the ionosphere with a weak crustal magnetic field, the net escape fluxes from the ionosphere with the crustal sources remain vital. The crustal magnetic field also leads to the expansion of the ionosphere and increase of the area exposed to solar wind. As a result, fluxes from higher altitudes essentially contribute to the flow pattern in Martian tail producing an excess of ion loss rate (∼15%) through the southern part of the tail. Thus, effects of inhibition and enhancement of the escape rate by the crustal magnetic field at Mars operate in competition producing a minor influence on the total ion loss.",

The energy flux peaks at ~36 mW/m<SUP>2</SUP>, while the peak ultraviolet (UV) brightness is estimated at 37 kR. We estimate the peak electron density and temperature to be 17.3 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and 1.8 ± 0.1 keV, respectively. Using magnetic flux shell mapping, we estimate that the radial width of the interaction at Europa's orbit spans roughly 3.6 ± 1.0 Europa radii.

  "abstract": "We examine here for the first time the effects of both global and regional dust storms on the formation of the Martian hot O corona and associated photochemical loss of O. Our study is conducted by utilizing our integrated model framework, which couples our Martian hot O corona model with a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model for Mars for the dusty and clear atmospheric condition cases. We present our results with the most up-to-date cross sections for the O(<SUP>3</SUP>P)-CO<SUB>2</SUB> collisions. The main effect of dust storms on the ionosphere is the upward shift of the ionosphere on the dayside, which results in an increase in production of hot O at all altitudes above the ionospheric peak. However, the dust-induced inflation of the neutral upper atmosphere results in an enhancement in collisional loss of hot O and thus effectively suppresses the hot O density, reducing the global photochemical loss rate by ~28% for the global dust storm scenario. The relative density structure of the hot O corona does not show any significant changes, while its magnitude decreases at all altitudes.",

  "abstract": "The Juno spacecraft provides unique close-up views of Jupiter underneath the synchrotron radiation belts while circling Jupiter in its 53-day orbits. The microwave radiometer (MWR) onboard measures Jupiter thermal radiation at wavelengths between 1.37 and 50 cm, penetrating the atmosphere to a pressure of a few hundred bars and greater. The mission provides the first measurements of Jupiter's deep atmosphere, down to ~250 bars in pressure, constraining the vertical distributions of its kinetic temperature and constituents. As a result, vertical structure models of Jupiter's atmosphere may now be tested by comparison with MWR data. Taking into account the MWR beam patterns and observation geometries, we test several published Jupiter atmospheric models against MWR data. Our residual analysis confirms Li et al.'s (2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073159\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL073159</A>) result that ammonia depletion persists down to 50-60 bars where ground-based Very Large Array was not able to observe. We also present an extension of the study that iteratively improves the input model and generates Jupiter brightness temperature maps which best match the MWR data. A feature of Juno's north-to-south scanning approach is that latitudinal structure is more easily obtained than longitudinal, and the creation of optimum two-dimensional maps is addressed in this approach.",

  "abstract": "Mars regional and global dust storms are able to impact the lower/upper atmospheres through dust aerosol radiative heating and cooling and atmospheric circulation. Here we present the first attempt to globally investigate how the dust impact transfers from the neutral upper atmosphere to the ionosphere and the induced magnetosphere above 100-km altitude. This is achieved by running a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model under nondusty and dusty atmospheric conditions for the 2017 late-winter regional storm and the 1971-1972 global storm. Our results show that the dayside main ionospheric layer (below ∼250-km altitude) undergoes an overall upwelling, where photochemical reactions dominate. The peak electron density remains unchanged, and the peak altitude shift is in accordance with the upper atmospheric expansion (∼5 and ∼15 km for the regional and global storms, respectively). Controlled by the day-to-night transport, the nightside ionosphere responds to the dust storms in a close connection with what happens on the dayside but not apparently with the ambient atmospheric change. At higher altitudes, dust-induced perturbations propagate upward from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere and extend from the dayside to the nightside, within a broad region bounded by the induced magnetospheric boundary. It is found that the global dust storm is able to dramatically enhance the CO<SUP>2+</SUP> loss by a factor of ∼3, which amounts to an increase of ∼20% or more for total carbon loss (in the forms of neutrals and ions). Strong dust storms are a potentially important factor in atmospheric evolution at Mars.",

  "abstract": "In this work, we analysed both the evolution over time and the north-south (N-S) asymmetry of certain solar features with regards to their morphological type and area. We examined and compared simultaneously 4212 photospheric sunspot groups and 5781 chromospheric solar plage groups using data from the Ebro Observatory catalogues for the period 1910-1937. We found that the most frequently recorded groups of sunspots and solar plages are the smallest ones, and the total number of occurrences of these groups is, on average, about 23% higher for solar plages than for sunspots. Concerning the N-S asymmetry, when the northern hemisphere becomes predominant, it dominates the other hemisphere for a longer time than the opposite case and shows a higher asymmetry. In addition, we found that the normalized N-S asymmetry index, δ , of solar activity in terms of the occurrence of sunspots and solar plage groups follows approximately the same behaviour regardless of the morphological type, but presents a slight dependence on their area, since sunspot and solar plage groups show higher values of the δ index, the larger their areas are. Furthermore, we noticed three highly significant extremes in the N-S asymmetry, located around the minima of the 14th, 15th and 16th solar cycles (1912 [S]; 1924 [N]; 1933 [N]). However, the general trend is not equal in both structures, since in contrast to sunspots, solar plage groups present lower values of asymmetry throughout practically all the period under consideration. These facts could be interpreted in terms of magnetic cancellation processes and/or merging of close-by faculae.",

  "abstract": "We discuss, in a limited way, some of the challenges to advancing our understanding and description of the coupled plasma and neutral gas that make up the ionosphere and thermosphere (I-T). The I-T is strongly influenced by wave motions of the neutral atmosphere from the lower atmosphere and is coupled to the magnetosphere, which supplies energetic particle precipitation and field-aligned currents at high latitudes. The resulting plasma dynamics are associated with currents generated by solar heating and upward propagating waves, by heating from energetic particles and electromagnetic energy from the magnetosphere and by the closure of the field-aligned currents applied at high latitudes. These three contributors to the current are functions of position, magnetic activity, and other variables that must be unraveled to understand how the I-T responds to coupling from the surrounding regions of geospace. We have captured the challenges to this understanding in four major themes associated with coupling to the lower atmosphere, the generation and flow of currents within the I-T region, the coupling to the magnetosphere, and the response of the I-T region reflected in the neutral and plasma density changes. Addressing these challenges requires advances in observing the neutral density, composition, and velocity and simultaneous observations of the plasma density and motions as well as the particles and field-aligned current describing the magnetospheric energy inputs. Additionally, our modeling capability must advance to include better descriptions of the processes affecting the I-T region and incorporate coupling to below and above at smaller spatial and temporal scales.",

These now energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), no longer confined by the magnetic field, can travel out of the system similar to photons leaving a hot oven. ENAs have been used to image magnetospheric processes at Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. At Jupiter, the opportunities to image the magnetosphere have been limited and always from the perspective of the near-equatorial plane at distance &gt;139 RJ. The polar-orbiting Juno mission carries the Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument that is serendipitously sensitive to ENAs with energies &gt;50 keV, provided that there are no charged particles in the environment to mask their presence. Here we report on the first ENA observations of Jupiter's magnetosphere from a nonequatorial perspective. In this brief report we concentrate on emissions seen during Perijove 22 (PJ22) during very active conditions and compare them with emissions during the inactive Perijove 23 (PJ23). We observe, and discriminate between, distinct ENA signatures from the neutral gases occupying the orbit of Io (away from Io itself), the orbit of Europa (away from Europa), and from Jupiter itself. Strong ENA emissions from Io's orbit during PJ22 are associated with energetic particle injections observed near Io's orbit several hours earlier. Some injections occurred planetward of Io's L-shell (magnetic position), somewhat of a surprise given that injections are thought to be driven by outward transport of plasmas generated by Io.",

  "abstract": "The Io plasma torus is thought to lie in Jupiter's centrifugal equator, a location that depends on Jupiter's rotation and magnetic field. Yet previous observations and predictions of the location of the Io plasma torus are inconsistent. Here we test the hypothesis that the Io plasma torus lies in the centrifugal equator by comparison of observations by Juno radio occultations to predictions derived from Juno-era magnetic field models. These observations determine the locations of two torus components: The cold torus is centered near 5.3 Jovian radii (R<SUB>J</SUB>), and the \"torus beyond 5.5 R<SUB>J</SUB>,\" dominated by the warm torus, is centered near 5.9 R<SUB>J</SUB>. The observations deviate by 1-2° from the planar centrifugal equator expected for a Voyager epoch dipolar magnetic field. In each observation, the locations of distinct torus regions differ by as much as 1° indicating significant radial structure. The root-mean-square error between observation and prediction is smaller for predictions from the JRM09 magnetic field model than for predictions from the VIP4 magnetic field model, confirming the JRM09 model is an improvement over the VIP4 model. Agreement between observations and predictions improves for the warm torus if the magnetic field contributions of a nominal magnetospheric current sheet model are included but worsens for the cold torus. Magnetic field conditions around 5.3 R<SUB>J</SUB> are adequately represented by an internal field model without the current sheet. Conditions around 5.9 R<SUB>J</SUB> require internal and external contributions. These results place constraints on properties of the magnetospheric current sheet during the Juno epoch.",

  "abstract": "An exciting and novel science mission concept called Seismic and Atmospheric Exploration of Venus (SAEVe) has been developed which uses high-temperature electronics to enable a three-order magnitude increase in expected surface life (120 Earth days) over what has been achieved to date. This enables study of long-term, variable phenomena such as the seismicity of Venus and near surface weather, near surface energy balance, and atmospheric chemical composition. SAEVe also serves as a critical pathfinder for more sophisticated landers in the future. For example, first order seismic measurements by SAEVe will allow future missions to deliver better seismometers and systems to support the yet unknown frequency and magnitude of Venus events. SAEVe is focused on science that can be realized with low data volume instruments and will most benefit from temporal operations. The entire mission architecture and operations maximize science while minimizing energy usage and physical size and mass. The entire SAEVe system including its protective entry system is estimated to be around 45 kg and approximately 0.6 m diameter. These features allow SAEVe to be relatively cost effective and be easily integrated onto a Venus orbiter mission. The technologies needed to implement SAEVe are currently in development by several funded activities. Component and system level work is ongoing under NASA's Long Lived Insitu Solar System Explorer (LLISSE) project and the HOTTech program. <P />. LLISSE, is a NASA project to develop a small Venus lander that will operate on the surface of Venus for 60 days and measure variations in meteorology, radiance, and atmospheric chemistry. LLISSE is developing a full-function engineering model of a Venus lander that contains essentially all the core capabilities of SAEVe thus greatly reducing the technology risk to SAEVe. <P />The SAEVe long duration Venus lander promises exciting new science and is an ideal complimentary element to many future Venus orbiter missions being proposed or planned today.",

  "abstract": "When a magnetosheath jet (localized dynamic pressure enhancements) compresses ambient magnetosheath at a (relative) speed faster than the local magnetosonic speed, a bow wave or shock can form ahead of the jet. Such bow waves or shocks were recently observed to accelerate particles, thus contributing to magnetosheath heating and particle acceleration in the extended environment of Earth's bow shock. To further understand the characteristics of jet-driven bow waves, we perform a statistical study to examine which solar wind conditions favor their formation and whether it is common for them to accelerate particles. We identified 364 out of 2,859 (~13%) magnetosheath jets to have a bow wave or shock ahead of them with Mach number typically larger than 1.1. We show that large solar wind plasma beta, weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, large solar wind Alfvén Mach number, and strong solar wind dynamic pressure present favorable conditions for their formation. We also show that magnetosheath jets with bow waves or shocks are more frequently associated with higher maximum ion and electron energies than those without them, confirming that it is common for these structures to accelerate particles. In particular, magnetosheath jets with bow waves have electron energy flux enhanced on average by a factor of 2 compared to both those without bow waves and the ambient magnetosheath. Our study implies that magnetosheath jets can contribute to shock acceleration of particles especially for high Mach number shocks. Therefore, shock models should be generalized to include magnetosheath jets and concomitant particle acceleration.",

  "abstract": "Given similar sizes and compositions, Venus invites comparisons with Earth. While Earth convects in the plate tectonic regime, Venus' current and past tectonic states remain uncertain. Venus' impact crater distribution has led to competing models for its tectonic state, steady (e.g., stagnant lid) or catastrophic (e.g., episodic lid). Terrestrial geochemical evidence and geodynamic models suggest that planets may transition between tectonic states over time. Transitions can be triggered by increasing yield stress due to loss of water or by increasing surface temperature. Here, we revisit the classic endmember models of Venusian tectonics by modeling the transition from stable mobile lid convection into a stable stagnant lid in 3D spherical geometry. Transitions between states are governed by both regional and global scale instabilities, resulting in oscillations in heat flux, velocity, and magma production over Gyr time scales. The thermal and tectonic evolution of a convectively transitioning planet is neither catastrophic nor steady. Volcanism and tectonic yielding may be non-global in nature. At any given time, portions of the planetary surface may reflect apparently different styles of convection, with some regions being highly active and other regions being sluggish and inactive. For Venus, the implications are that global melt production and resurfacing are a natural consequence of lid-state evolution, without needing ad hoc resurfacing mechanisms which rely on a single governing lid-state. Geologic evidence suggests that the transition from mobile lid to stagnant lid is still on-going. Venus may have lost liquid surface water in the last third of its history.",

  "abstract": "This paper evaluates the role of magnetic reconnection in the dayside ionosphere of Mars in the collisional regime and presents some relevant data from the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) mission. Magnetic reconnection is an important process operating in the solar corona, planetary magnetospheres, and astrophysical plasmas, but most of the literature focuses on collisionless plasmas. However, at Mars the reconnection should often occur in regions where collisions are important. Mars does not have a large-scale global magnetic field; however, Mars has locally large magnetic fields associated with remnant crustal magnetization, particularly in the highland regions of the southern hemisphere. The crustal fields provide a \"target\" for reconnection both in the ionosphere and in the magnetotail of Mars. The current paper emphasizes the dayside ionosphere. Magnetic reconnection is associated with topological changes in the magnetic field and is also a source of energy for the plasma and can thus affect the ionospheric dynamics and ion loss at Mars. Both theoretical concepts and MAVEN particle and field data from several instruments are considered in this paper.",

  "abstract": "Flux transfer events are transient magnetized plasma structures that are self-balancing, rope-like phenomena that can appear at the Earth's magnetopause when the interplanetary magnetic field is southward. The formation of this type of flux rope has been unclear. Using measurements of particles and magnetic fields on the MMS spacecraft, we find that rope-like structures containing magnetospheric energetic electrons have exactly the same occurrence rate as those without magnetospheric electrons, independent of solar wind properties and location of observation. This equality is consistent with a pair of flux bundles being generated at the same time but displaced from each other as an outcome of their collision and resultant entanglement and reconnection. This entanglement reconnection produces one flux rope with two ends connected to the magnetosphere and the other connected on both ends to the shocked solar wind. Away from the subsolar entanglement zone, reconnection transports magnetic flux from the \"closed\" magnetosphere to the \"open\" tail lobes, as predicted by Dungey (1961, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.6.47\">https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.6.47</A>).",

  "abstract": "Large-scale magnetic fields have been observed in Venus' ionosphere by both the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) and Venus Express spacecraft. In this study, we examine the formation and evolution of the large-scale magnetic field in the Venus ionosphere using a sophisticated global multispecies Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model that has been developed for Venus (Ma et al., 2013, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JA018265\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JA018265</A>). A time-dependent model run is performed under varying solar wind dynamic pressure. Based on model results, we find that (1) the initial response of the induced magnetosphere is fast (~min), (2) a large-scale magnetic field gradually forms in the ionosphere when the solar wind dynamic pressure suddenly exceeds the ionospheric thermal pressure, (3) both the penetration and decay of the large-scale magnetic field in the ionosphere are slow (~hr), and (4) the ion escape rate has a nonlinear response to the change of solar wind dynamic pressure.",

  "abstract": "To understand magnetosphere-ionosphere conditions that result in thermal emission velocity enhancement (STEVE) and subauroral ion drifts (SAID) during the substorm recovery phase, we present substorm aurora, particle injection, and current systems during two STEVE events. Those events are compared to substorm events with similar strength but without STEVE. We found that the substorm surge and intense upward currents for the events with STEVE reach the dusk, while those for the non-STEVE substorms are localized around midnight. The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite observations show that location of particle injection and fast plasma sheet flows for the STEVE events also shifts duskward. Electron injection is stronger and ion injection is weaker for the STEVE events compared to the non-STEVE events. SAID are measured by Super Dual Auroral Radar Network during the STEVE events, but the non-STEVE events only showed latitudinally wide subauroral polarization streams without SAID. To interpret the observations, Rice Convection Model (RCM) simulations with injection at premidnight and midnight have been conducted. The simulations successfully explain the stronger electron injection, weaker ion injection, and formation of SAID for injection at premidnight, because injected electrons reach the premidnight inner magnetosphere and form a narrower separation between the ion and electron inner boundaries. We suggest that substorms and particle injections extending far duskward away from midnight offer a condition for creating STEVE and SAID due to stronger electron injection to premidnight. The THEMIS all-sky imager network identified the east-west length of the STEVE arc to be ~1900 km (~2.5 h magnetic local time) and the duration to be 1-1.5 h.",

Using data from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on board Mars Express (MEX), we assess the interaction of the Martian ionosphere with the comet's coma and possibly magnetic tail during the orbit of their closest approach. The topside ionospheric electron density profile is evaluated from the altitude of the peak density of the ionosphere up to the MEX altitude. We find complex and rapid variability in the ionospheric profile along the MEX orbit, not seen even after the impact of a large coronal mass ejection. Before closest approach, large electron density reductions predominate, which could be caused either by comet water damping or comet magnetic field interactions. After closest approach, a substantial electron density rise predominates. Moreover, several extra topside layers are visible along the whole orbit at different altitudes, which could be related to different processes as we discuss.",

  "abstract": "Non-adiabatic energization and transport of planetary ions in the vicinity of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices at Mercury are statistically investigated using a magnetohydrodynamic model combined with a test particle tracing technique. The measurements from the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, Geochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft show signatures of KH waves in the magnetospheric flanks, especially on the duskside. We examine here the energization and transport of heavy ions of planetary origin such as Na<SUP>+</SUP> associated with the growth of the KH instability on both the dawn and dusk sides of the magnetosphere, and for both northward and southward interplanetary magnetic field configurations. We find that in all cases those planetary ions in the magnetosphere can be accelerated non-adiabatically with a level of acceleration larger on the dawnside. The transport of those ions is controlled by the convection electric field in the magnetosheath. Those planetary ions when picked up in the duskside magnetosphere where the KH waves have been mainly observed at Mercury stagnate inside the magnetosphere and, hence, are not expected to escape. The present study indicates that these ions may likely stay inside the magnetosphere and sputter the planetary surface on the duskside preferentially, being the source of secondary neutrals from the planetary surface.",

  "abstract": "Martian subsolar electron temperatures obtained below 250 km are examined using data obtained by instruments on the Mars Atmosphere Evolution Mission (MAVEN) during the three subsolar deep dip campaigns and a one-dimensional fluid model. This analysis was done because of the uncertainty in MAVEN low electron temperature observations at low altitudes and the fact that the Level 2 temperatures reported from the MAVEN Langmuir Probe and Waves instrument are more than 400 K above the neutral temperatures at the lowest altitudes sampled (~120 km). These electron temperatures are well above those expected before MAVEN was launched. We find that an empirical normalization parameter, neutral pressure divided by local electron heating rate, organized the electron temperature data and identified a similar altitude (~160 km) and time scale (~2,000 s) for all three deep dips. We show that MAVEN data are not consistent with a plasma characterized by electrons in thermal equilibrium with the neutral population above 100 km. Because of the lack data below 120 km and the uncertainties of the data and the cross sections used in the one-dimensional fluid model above 120 km, we cannot use MAVEN observations to prove that the electron temperature converges to the neutral temperature below 100 km. However, the uncertainty of the electron temperature altitude profile below 120 km does not impact our understanding of the role of electron temperature in determining ion escape rates because ion escape is determined by electron temperatures above 180 km.",

  "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is often suggested to be implicated in a variety of dynamic phenomena observed in the complex magnetosphere of Mars. We present a first global survey of ion jets within current sheets, which are thought of as a primary product of magnetic reconnection, with Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) data obtained on the dayside and nightside in the Martian magnetosphere. We develop a fully automated algorithm to efficiently and reliably identify ion flow velocity deviations during current sheet crossings recorded by MAVEN. The obtained statistical results show that (i) sunward and anti-sunward ion jets embedded within current sheets are commonly and widely observed in the dayside and nightside magnetosphere of Mars, (ii) measured magnetic field profiles and inferred magnetic topology during the jet crossings are generally consistent with those expected for reconnecting current sheets, (iii) the jet occurrence is apparently independent of upstream driver conditions, and (iv) most of the identified current sheets are thin with a roughly ion scale half-thickness and are embedded in low beta plasma, suggesting that they are seemingly capable of reconnection based on the known onset conditions. The widespread distributions and common detection of ion jets, as well as the ubiquitous presence of thin, low-beta current sheets, imply that magnetic reconnection could operate frequently in many locations around Mars, thereby playing an important role in the dynamics of the Martian magnetosphere for most, if not all, of the solar wind conditions in the present epoch.",

  "abstract": "The ionosphere of Venus is a weakly ionized plasma layer embedded in the planet's upper atmosphere. Planetary ionospheres provide an excellent opportunity to study how our variable Sun affects the planets in our solar system. Because ionospheres are reservoirs from which atmospheric species can be lost to space, studying how ionospheres respond to changes in solar activity can help us understand how planetary atmospheres have evolved since their formation. While variations of the main and lower ionospheric peaks of Venus have been well studied, the behavior of the ionosphere above the altitude of the greatest electron density has not been fully constrained. To investigate the behavior of this region, we use electron density profiles obtained by the Venus Radio Science experiment aboard Venus Express. An increase in the response of the electron density to increasing solar irradiance with increasing altitude above the peak is readily apparent in these data. By using a one-dimensional photochemical equilibrium model to investigate the factors that drive the variations of the ionosphere of Venus, we find that changes in the composition of the underlying neutral atmosphere are responsible for the observed increase in ionospheric response with altitude.",

  "abstract": "In the Earth's magnetosheath plasma waves, nonlinear structures associated with characteristic ion populations can occur. Understanding the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere requires a deeper knowledge of the underlying magnetosheath kinetic microstructure. We study a 45 min interval when the MMS spacecraft observed a southward magnetic field (Bz &lt; 0 nT) in the dayside magnetosheath. Using magnetic field and plasma data, we analyze three transient dynamic pressure enhancements identified as magnetosheath jets. The characteristics of these jets are different, suggesting different origins. While two of them, called J1 and J2, exhibit large increment in velocity and almost no density increment, the third jet (J3) shows large density enhancements with almost no velocity increment. The duration of J3 is ∼7 times longer than those of J1 and J2. J3 occurs at the region where the negative B<SUB>z</SUB> becomes positive. Ion distributions inside the jets are different. J1 and J2 show a secondary field-aligned beam, which is not present in J3, suggesting that magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause is responsible for their formation. Distributions inside J3 are more isotropic. B field and plasma signatures inside J3 correspond to the crossing of a sector boundary, similar to the heliospheric plasma sheet, suggesting that J3 forms by the evolution and interaction of a solar wind structure with the bow shock and magnetosheath. Fluctuations inside J3 have larger transverse components, although they propagate at large angles to B. In contrast, waves in regions between the jets are compressive and are identified as mirror mode waves.",

  "abstract": "In October 2017, the first interstellar object within our solar system was discovered. Today designated 1I/'Oumuamua, it shows characteristics that have never before been observed in a celestial body. Due to these characteristics, an in-situ investigation of 1I would be of extraordinary scientific value. Previous studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible using current and near-term technologies, however, with an anticipated launch date of 2020-2021. This is too soon to be realistic. This paper aims at addressing the question of the feasibility of a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua in 2024 and beyond. Using the OITS trajectory simulation tool, various scenarios are analyzed, including a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, a Jupiter powered flyby, and more complex schemes including a Mars and Venus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, we identify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a launch date in 2033, a total velocity increment of 18.2 km/s, and arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2048. With an additional deep space maneuver before the powered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory with a launch date in 2030, a total velocity increment of 15.3 km/s, and an arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2052 were identified. Both launch dates would provide over a decade for spacecraft development, in contrast to the previously identified 2020-2021 launch dates. Furthermore, the distance from the Sun at the Oberth burn is at 5 Solar radii. This results in heat flux values of the same order of magnitude as for the Parker Solar Probe. We conclude that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using existing and near-term technologies and there is sufficient time for developing such a mission.",

  "abstract": "Solar tides are responsible for much of the spatial-temporal variability of Mars' upper atmosphere (100-∼200 km). However, the tidal spectrum, its latitude versus Ls variability, and its vertical evolution remain uncertain. In this paper, Mars Climate Sounder temperature measurements at 76 km above Mars' areoid are used to construct a multiyear latitude versus Ls climatology of the tidal spectrum. The most important spectral components include the solar-synchronous (\"migrating\") components DW1, SW2, and the solar-asynchronous (\"nonmigrating\") tides DE3, DE2, DE1, SE1, S0, and SW1. The Mars Climate Database (MCD), which provides predictions from the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique Global Climate Model, captures particularly well the amplitudes and key structural features of the solar-asynchronous tides at 76 km that furthermore underly the large longitudinal structures in density that are observed between 100 and 200 km. Height-latitude and latitude-Ls structures of MCD density perturbations are therefore examined between 76 and 172 km and interpreted in terms of mean wind and dissipation effects. In particular, due to the smaller radius and more intense zonal-mean zonal winds at Mars compared to Earth, Doppler-shift effects are significantly exaggerated compared to Earth. Evidence is also provided for nonnegligible contributions to density variability from stationary planetary waves which arise from tide-tide nonlinear interactions. It is moreover shown that MCD captures the salient amplitude and phase characteristics of the ∼±30-60% longitudinal density perturbations measured by the Mars Global Surveyor accelerometer. This, and the excellent MCD-MCS agreement at 76 km, lends credibility to the ability of MCD to provide new insights into thermosphere density variability at Mars due to vertical coupling by solar tides.",

  "abstract": "The extreme substorm event on 5 April 2010 (THEMIS AL = -2,700 nT, called supersubstorm) was investigated to examine its driving processes, the aurora current system responsible for the supersubstorm, and the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T) responses. An interplanetary shock created shock aurora, but the shock was not a direct driver of the supersubstorm onset. Instead, the shock with a large southward IMF strengthened the growth phase with substantially larger ionosphere currents, more rapid equatorward motion of the auroral oval, larger ionosphere conductance, and more elevated magnetotail pressure than those for the growth phase of classical substorms. The auroral brightening at the supersubstorm onset was small, but the expansion phase had multistep enhancements of unusually large auroral brightenings and electrojets. The largest activity was an extremely large poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and subsequent auroral streamer, which started ~20 min after the substorm auroral onset during a steady southward IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> and elevated dynamic pressure. Those were associated with a substorm current wedge (SCW), plasma sheet flow, relativistic particle injection and precipitation down to the D-region, total electron content (TEC), conductance, and neutral wind in the thermosphere, all of which were unusually large compared to classical substorms. The SCW did not extend over the entire nightside auroral activity but was localized azimuthally to a few 100 km in the ionosphere around the PBI and streamer. These results reveal the importance of localized magnetotail reconnection for releasing large energy accumulation that can affect geosynchronous satellites and produce the extreme M-I-T responses.",

  "abstract": "Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) cameras on orbiting spacecraft at Earth and Saturn helped greatly to diagnose these complex magnetospheres. Within this decade, the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will make ENA imaging a major thrust in understanding Jupiter's complex magnetosphere. The present polar-orbiting Juno mission at Jupiter carries no ENA camera. But, the Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector Instrument is sensitive to &gt;50 keV ENAs, provided there are no local charged particles to mask their presence. Juno offers great service to interpreting past serendipitous and future dedicated ENA imaging with its orbit providing unique viewing perspectives. Here we report Juno observations of ENAs from Jupiter's polar regions. These ENAs likely arise from energetic ions that nearly precipitate in the main auroral regions and mirror magnetically within, and charge exchange with, Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Jupiter proves itself different from Saturn, as ENAs generated from precipitating ions were not identified there.",

  "abstract": "An outburst of Draconid meteor shower was predicted for October 8 to 9, 2018.

The main peak was observed at the solar longitude λ<SUB>o</SUB> =195.359<SUP>∘</SUP> ±0.003<SUP>∘</SUP> , what is equivalent to 23<SUP>h</SUP><SUP>07 . 5 m</SUP> ±5<SUP>m</SUP> UT. This result is in good agreement with other reports as well as with the predictions. Two other sub-peaks or enhancements of the activity were detected later in the night.

This is equivalent to ZHR = 140 ± 30 which is higher than the majority of the models predicted. The analysis of the mass distribution index evolution and the comparison with other experiments suggests that the later activity was probably caused by the mixture of the different trails of the stream which were more dispersed. The flux of the meteoroids was three to four times smaller in comparison with the 2011 Draconid outburst. When comparing the radiants and velocities of the observed meteors with the model data, good agreement was found for the right ascension and velocity but a small offset of about +0.5<SUP>∘</SUP> was observed in declination. On the other hand, the mean main peak radiant fits well the model of Maslov (2011).",

  "abstract": "The Mars 2020 Perseverance rover is equipped with a next-generation engineering camera imaging system that represents an upgrade over previous Mars rover missions. These upgrades will improve the operational capabilities of the rover with an emphasis on drive planning, robotic arm operation, instrument operations, sample caching activities, and documentation of key events during entry, descent, and landing (EDL). There are a total of 16 cameras in the Perseverance engineering imaging system, including 9 cameras for surface operations and 7 cameras for EDL documentation. There are 3 types of cameras designed for surface operations: Navigation cameras (Navcams, quantity 2), Hazard Avoidance Cameras (Hazcams, quantity 6), and Cachecam (quantity 1). The Navcams will acquire color stereo images of the surface with a 96<SUP>∘</SUP>×73<SUP>∘</SUP> field of view at 0.33 mrad/pixel. The Hazcams will acquire color stereo images of the surface with a 136<SUP>∘</SUP>×102<SUP>∘</SUP> at 0.46 mrad/pixel. The Cachecam, a new camera type, will acquire images of Martian material inside the sample tubes during caching operations at a spatial scale of 12.5 microns/pixel. There are 5 types of EDL documentation cameras: The Parachute Uplook Cameras (PUCs, quantity 3), the Descent stage Downlook Camera (DDC, quantity 1), the Rover Uplook Camera (RUC, quantity 1), the Rover Descent Camera (RDC, quantity 1), and the Lander Vision System (LVS) Camera (LCAM, quantity 1). The PUCs are mounted on the parachute support structure and will acquire video of the parachute deployment event as part of a system to characterize parachute performance. The DDC is attached to the descent stage and pointed downward, it will characterize vehicle dynamics by capturing video of the rover as it descends from the skycrane. The rover-mounted RUC, attached to the rover and looking upward, will capture similar video of the skycrane from the vantage point of the rover and will also acquire video of the descent stage flyaway event. The RDC, attached to the rover and looking downward, will document plume dynamics by imaging the Martian surface before, during, and after rover touchdown. The LCAM, mounted to the bottom of the rover chassis and pointed downward, will acquire 90<SUP>∘</SUP>×90<SUP>∘</SUP> FOV images during the parachute descent phase of EDL as input to an onboard map localization by the Lander Vision System (LVS). The rover also carries a microphone, mounted externally on the rover chassis, to capture acoustic signatures during and after EDL. The Perseverance rover launched from Earth on July 30th, 2020, and touchdown on Mars is scheduled for February 18th, 2021.",

  "abstract": "A vigorous regional dust storm substantially altered both the global atmospheric thermal structure and the magnitude and spatial distribution of dust loading within the Mars atmosphere between 1 and 9 June 2018. We examine the development and decay of this storm in latitude, longitude, altitude, and time, employing observations by the Mars Climate Sounder on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Dust layer top altitudes rose from seasonal-normal values of ~40 to ~70 km. Dust lofting to high altitudes was localized between 0° and ~60°W longitude, and between 60°N and 60°S latitude. Intensification of paired meridional overturning circulation cells within the study area is confirmed by strong nighttime dynamical heating in higher latitudes of both hemispheres. By the end of this episode, significant dust loading was present at altitudes greater than 50 km above all longitudes on Mars, and other dust lifting centers had been activated.",

  "abstract": "The ellipsoidal figure of Phobos has been tentatively interpreted as resulting from accretion in a tidal environment close to its parent planet Mars. The issue is compounded by the rapid tidal decay of the moon's orbit. Consequently, when and where the moon actually formed remains elusive. We determined the gravity equipotential ellipsoid of Phobos during its orbital decay and studied the evolution of surface ellipsoidal heights. We found that the equipotential ellipsoid closely fits the body shape near 3.6 Mars radii. Meanwhile, the height distribution resembles Gaussian at 3.3 Mars radii, suggesting equilibrium of topography. The ellipsoidal shape may have accreted here under appreciable tidal influence of roughly half the magnitude at Phobos' current position (at 2.76 Mars radii). This lends evidential support to the hypothesis that Phobos is not a primordial object but has reaccreted from a debris ring after a previous disruption event.",

  "abstract": "One of the main sources of magnetospheric particles is solar wind penetration through the magnetopause—a current sheet separating the cold, dense magnetosheath from the hot, rarified magnetospheric plasmas. The mechanism responsible for magnetosheath particle transport across the magnetopause has been better investigated for the near-Earth dayside magnetopause (contrary to the nightside), where it was found that such a transport is controlled by the current sheet thickness, structure, and dynamics. Because plasma properties and magnetic field intensity in the magnetosheath significantly change as a function of radial distance from the Earth, the current sheet characteristics are different near Earth and at distant nightside magnetopause. Comparative investigations between near-Earth and distant magnetopauses, however, require statistical observations at the two locations during the same time interval, that enable control for the same upstream solar wind driving conditions. In this paper, we perform such a study using the four Magnetosheric Multiscale (MMS) and two Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) probes to compare the characteristics of magnetic field and plasma populations during magnetopause crossings, which are separated by about 50 R<SUB>E</SUB>. We find that the current sheet profiles is similar at two locations. We also show that the magnetopause current sheet thickness scales with the local magnetosheath ion gyroradius. A weaker magnetic field on both sides of the current sheet is correlated with smaller current density at lunar distances.",

  "abstract": "Space weather is the main source of uncertainty in the position of all objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) below about 1,000 km. The main impact is strong variation in the neutral density of the thermosphere as it responds to radiative inputs from the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet wavelength range, energetic particle precipitation in the high-latitude auroral zones, and global-scale electrical currents generated during geomagnetic storms. Waves and instabilities from the lower atmosphere can also influence thermospheric density in complex ways. The variation in neutral density leads to variable drag forces on satellites flying through the thermosphere, which in turn causes orbital track changes. We currently lack the ability to accurately model and predict the neutral density changes in the thermosphere in response to space weather inputs. Operational empirical models of thermospheric density are inaccurate during space weather events, and mandate that LEO orbital tracks carry large \"error ellipsoids\" around all objects to account for positional uncertainty. This leads to many more \"conjunction\" warnings than necessary as large error ellipsoids are frequently calculated to intersect in orbit. As the LEO domain becomes more crowded with the advent of commercial \"megaconstellations\" we face a growing challenge to reduce orbital uncertainties by developing whole atmosphere models to enable timely and accurate forecasts of thermospheric conditions. We recommend that researchers, forecasters, and policy makers coordinate to ensure that space weather research and forecasting is tightly integrated into upcoming changes to the operational Space Traffic Management system.",

The magnetotail current sheet structure and stability depend mostly on the kinetic properties of the plasma populating the magnetotail. One of the most underinvestigated properties of this plasma is electron temperature anisotropy, which may contribute a large fraction of the total current. Using observations from five missions in the magnetotail, we examine the electron temperature anisotropy, T<SUB>e‖</SUB>/T<SUB>e⊥</SUB>, and its potential contribution to the current density, quantified by the firehose parameter (β<SUB>e‖</SUB>-β<SUB>e⊥</SUB>)/2, across y∈[-20,20]R<SUB>E</SUB> and x∈[-100,-10]R<SUB>E</SUB>. We find that a significant fraction (&gt;30%) of all current sheets have an anisotropic electron current density &gt;10% of the total current. These current sheets form two distinct groups: (1) near-Earth (&lt;30 R<SUB>E</SUB>) accompanied by weak plasma flows (&lt;100 km/s) and enhanced equatorial magnetic field (&gt;3 nT) and (2) middle tail (&gt;40 R<SUB>E</SUB>) accompanied by fast plasma flows (&gt;300 km/s) and small equatorial magnetic field (≤1 nT). For a significant number of near-Earth current sheets, the anisotropic electron current can be &gt;25% of the total current density. Our findings suggest that electron temperature anisotropy should be included in current sheet models describing realistic magnetotail structure and dynamics.",

  "abstract": "Plasma instabilities have been studied for many decades in the terrestrial ionosphere via remote and in-situ measurement techniques. The study of these kilometer-scale instabilities has provided crucial insight into coupling between the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. A special high-time cadence observation mode developed for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission has demonstrated for the first time that kilometer-scale density fluctuations exist at Mars. Density and associated magnetic fluctuations are observed to occur both in and out of phase with each other, suggesting that multiple instability mechanisms are active, similar to Earth. The unique solar wind interaction with Mars and its localized crustal magnetic fields appears to play an important role in the formation of these irregularity events, which form preferentially during meridionally pointing magnetic field within the ionosphere. This is in contrast to Earth where the strong dipole magnetic field dominates in the terrestrial ionosphere.",

  "abstract": "We have used the Auburn Global Hybrid Code in 3-D to study the generation, dynamics, and global structure of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) from the magnetotail to the ionosphere. Our results show that KAWs are generated in magnetic reconnection in the plasma sheet, located around fast flows, and carrying transverse electromagnetic perturbations, parallel Poynting fluxes, parallel currents, and parallel electric field. Overall, shear Alfvénic turbulent spectrum is found in the plasma sheet. The KAWs are shear Alfvén waves possessing short perpendicular wavelength with k<SUB>⊥</SUB>ρ<SUB>i</SUB>∼1, where k<SUB>⊥</SUB> is the perpendicular wave number and ρ<SUB>i</SUB> the ion Larmor radius. The KAWs are identified by their dispersion relation and polarizations. The structures of these KAWs embedded in the plasma sheet are also revealed by placing a virtual satellite in the tail. In order to understand whether the Poynting fluxes carried by the shear Alfvén waves/KAWs in the plasma sheet can be carried directly along field lines to the ionosphere, we have tracked the wave propagation from the plasma sheet to the ionosphere. It is found that in front of the flow-braking region, the structure and strength of the shear Alfvén waves are significantly altered due to interaction with the dipole-like field, mainly by the flow shear associated with the azimuthal convection. Also in front of the dipole-like field region, ion kinetic effects (Hall effects) lead to the generation of additional pairs of KAWs. As such, the generation and transport of the shear Alfvén waves/KAWs to the ionosphere are illustrated for the first time in a comprehensive manner on the global scale.",

  "abstract": "The canonical picture of the magnetotail of unmagnetized planets consists of draped interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) forming opposite-directed lobes, separated by the current sheet. DiBraccio et al. (2018, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077251\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077251</A>) showed that Mars's magnetotail has a twist departing from this picture. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) results suggest that the asymmetry in how open field lines connected to the planet populate the tail causes the apparent twist. To validate this interpretation, we compare the tail topology determined from MHD simulations to that inferred from data collected by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft, in particular, how each topology responds to the upstream IMF orientation. The occurrence rates for open topology from both data and MHD vary with IMF polarities in a similar fashion as the tail twisting. This suggests that Mars's crustal fields have a global effect on the magnetosphere configuration, supporting the picture of a \"hybrid\" magnetotail that is partly induced/draped and partly intrinsic/planetary in origin.",

  "abstract": "The spatial and temporal characterization of trapped charged particle trajectories in magnetospheres has been extensively studied in dipole magnetic field structures. Such studies have allowed the calculation of spatial quantities, such as equatorial loss cone size as a function of radial distance, the location of the mirror points along particular field lines (L-shells) as a function of the particle's equatorial pitch angle, and temporal quantities such as the bounce period and drift period as a function of the radial distance and the particle's pitch angle at the equator. In this study, we present analogous calculations for the disk-like field structure associated with the giant rotation-dominated magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn as described by the University College London/Achilleos-Guio-Arridge (UCL/AGA) magnetodisk model. We discuss the effect of the magnetodisk field on various particle parameters and make a comparison with the analogous motion in a dipole field. The bounce period in a magnetodisk field is in general smaller the larger the equatorial distance and pitch angle, by a factor as large as ∼8 for Jupiter and ∼2.5 for Saturn. Similarly, the drift period is generally smaller, by a factor as large as ∼2.2 for equatorial distances ∼20-24 R<SUB>J</SUB> at Jupiter and ∼1.5 for equatorial distances ∼7-11 R<SUB>S</SUB> at Saturn.",

  "abstract": "Magnetosheath jets are transient, localized dynamic pressure enhancements found downstream of the Earth's bow shock in the magnetosheath region. Using a pre-existing database of magnetosheath jets we train a neural network to distinguish between jets found downstream of a quasi-parallel bow shock θBn &lt;45) and jets downstream of a quasi-perpendicular bow shock (θBn &gt;45). The initial database was compiled using MMS measurements in the magnetosheath (downstream) to identify and classify them as \"quasi-parallel\" or \"quasi-perpendicular\", while the neural network uses only solar wind (upstream) measurements from the OMNIweb database. To evaluate the results, a comparison with three physics-based modeling approaches is done. It is shown that neural networks are systematically outperforming the other methods by achieving a ~93 agreement with the initial dataset, while the rest of the methods achieve around 80%. The better performance of the neural networks likely is due to the fact that they use information from more solar wind quantities than the physics-based models, even in the absence of certain upstream properties, such as IMF direction.",

The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover carried out a comprehensive investigation to understand the depositional and diagenetic processes recorded in the rocks of VRR. Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) evolved gas analyses (EGA) were performed on three samples from the ridge and one from directly beneath the ridge. SAM evolved H<SUB>2</SUB>O data suggested the presence of an Fe-rich dioctahedral smectite, such as nontronite, in the sample from beneath the ridge. H<SUB>2</SUB>O data are also consistent with ferripyrophyllite in VRR samples. SAM SO<SUB>2</SUB> data indicated that all samples contained Mg sulfates and some Fe sulfate. Several volatile detections suggested trace reduced sulfur sources, such as Fe sulfides and/or S-bearing organic compounds, in two samples while significant O<SUB>2</SUB> and NO evolved from one sample indicated the presence of oxychlorine and nitrate/nitrite salts, respectively. The O<SUB>2</SUB> evolution was the second highest to date and the first observed in ~1,200 sols. HCl released from all samples likely resulted, in part, from trace chloride salts. All samples evolved CO<SUB>2</SUB> and CO consistent with oxidized carbon compounds (e.g., oxalates), while some CO<SUB>2</SUB> may result from carbonate. SAM-derived constraints on the mineralogy and chemistry of VRR materials, in the context of additional mineralogy, geochemistry, and sedimentology information obtained by Curiosity, support a complex diagenetic history that involved fluids of a range of possible salinities, redox characteristics, pHs, and temperatures.",

  "abstract": "The solar wind plasma is a major plasma source for the Earth's magnetosphere, which has a strong influence on the magnetotail plasma and field properties. The relative importance of different plasma entry mechanisms and pathways is largely determined by the solar wind conditions. Therefore, the spatial and temporal dependence of magnetotail plasma and field properties under different kinds of solar wind conditions is critically important for understanding the Earth's magnetosphere. This study presents a statistical study of fundamental magnetotail plasma properties in a normalized reference frame by utilizing 12+ years of data from NASA's Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission. These statistical maps are mostly in agreement with the magnetosheath of MHD runs from the CCMC BATS-R-US model, but some features in the maps can be explained by kinetic particle physics, not present in the MHD. The results are also used to investigate the presence of any magnetotail plasma parameter asymmetries and their possible causes.",

On these orbits, the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) instrument was operated in Active Ionospheric Sounding (AIS) mode at much higher altitude than normal, acting as a local sounder and detecting cold plasma structures in this region. In this paper we combine MARSIS tail measurements with solar wind data from the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) instrument and the Magnetometer (MAG) from Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) in order to investigate possible factors affecting plasma transport from the dayside and through the terminator. MARSIS observed structured cold ionospheric plasma along its trajectory, at all altitudes and solar zenith angles (SZAs). Isolated regions of cold plasma were also observed on each orbit as the spacecraft crossed the terminator, even at high altitudes. We conclude that the variability of plasma seen in the tail results from a multifactorial transport process, the development of which cannot be attributed to a sole parameter influencing it, despite the availability of simultaneous high quality solar wind measurements.",

  "abstract": "Ion loss to space has played an important role in atmospheric escape and climate change on Mars because of intense solar activity during a younger, more active phase of the Sun. Although the existence of an intrinsic magnetic field on ancient Mars is also a key factor in ion loss, its effect remains unclear. Based on multispecies magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations, we investigated processes and rates of ion loss from Mars under extreme solar conditions and the existence of a dipole field with different strengths. The effects of a dipole field on ion loss depend on whether the dipolar magnetic pressure is strong enough to sustain the solar wind dynamic pressure. When the dipole field is existent but weak, it facilitates the cusp outflow and increases the loss rates of molecular ions (O<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and CO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP>) by a factor of 6 through the high-latitude magnetotail. When the dipole field is strong enough, the loss rates of molecular ions are decreased by 2 orders of magnitude, and peaks of the escape flux are located near the equatorial plane due to the magnetic reconnection in the northern-dusk or southern-dawn lobe regions. The pickup process on the extended oxygen corona created by the strong EUV flux contributes to the total O<SUP>+</SUP> loss. Therefore, the effects of the dipole field are less pronounced for O<SUP>+</SUP>. Under more moderate solar EUV conditions, the effects on O<SUP>+</SUP> loss can be stronger and thus contribute to climate change.",

The future changes in GLM summer precipitation and the sources of projection uncertainty under four scenarios are investigated using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. The GLM summer precipitation is projected to increase by 1.76 ± 1.57% (2.54 ± 2.22%), 1.33 ± 1.97% (3.52 ± 3.05%), 0.96 ± 2.04% (3.51 ± 4.97%), and 1.71 ± 2.38% (5.75 ± 5.92%) in the near (long) term under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The enhancement is caused by thermodynamic responses due to increased moisture, which is partly offset by dynamic responses due to weakened circulation. The uncertainty in GLM precipitation projection is the largest in SSP5-8.5 long-term projection. The uncertainty of submonsoon precipitation projections is larger than that in GLM precipitation. The uncertainty of monsoon precipitation projection arises from the circulation changes, which can be partly explained by model-dependent response to uniform sea surface temperature warming.",

We selected all images with a global view of Venus to investigate how the albedo depends on longitude. Bertaux et al. (2016, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004958\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004958</A>) reported a peak in albedo around 100° longitude and speculated on an association with the Aphrodite Terra mountains. We show that this peak is most likely an artifact, resulting from long-term albedo variations coupled with considerable temporal gaps in data sampling over longitude. We also used a subset of images to investigate how the albedo depends on local time, selecting only south pole viewing images of the dayside (local times 7-17 hr). Akatsuki observed mountain-induced waves in the late afternoon at 283 nm and 10 μm (Fukuhara et al., 2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2873\">https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2873</A>). We expect that the presence of such waves may introduce 365-nm albedo variations with a periodicity of one solar day (116.75 Earth days). We searched for such a periodicity peak at 15:30-16:00 local time and low latitudes but did not find it. In conclusion, we find that temporal albedo variations, both short and long term, dominate any systematic variations with longitude and local time. The nature of VMC dayside observations limits regular data sampling along longitudes, so longitudinal variations, if they exist, are difficult to extract. We conclude that any influence by the Venus surface on 365-nm albedo is negligible within this data set.",

  "abstract": "Satellite observations with high-resolution measurements have demonstrated the existence of intermittent current sheets and occurrence of magnetic reconnection in a quasi-parallel magnetosheath behind the terrestrial bow shock. In this letter, by performing a three-dimensional global hybrid simulation, we investigated the characteristics of the quasi-parallel magnetosheath of the bow shock, which is formed due to the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. Current sheets with widths of several ion inertial lengths are found to be produced in the magnetosheath after the upstream large-amplitude electromagnetic waves penetrate through the shock and are then compressed in the downstream. Magnetic reconnection consequently occurs in these current sheets, where high-speed ion flow jets are identified in the outflow region. Simultaneously, flux ropes with the extension (along the y direction) of about several Earth's radii are also observed. Our simulation shed new insight on the mechanism for the occurrence of magnetic reconnection in the quasi-parallel shocked magnetosheath.",

  "abstract": "During 2018 and 2019, the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover investigated the chemistry, morphology, and stratigraphy of Vera Rubin ridge (VRR). Using orbital data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, scientists attributed the strong 860 nm signal associated with VRR to the presence of red crystalline hematite. However, Mastcam multispectral data and CheMin X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show that the depth of the 860 nm absorption is negatively correlated with the abundance of red crystalline hematite, suggesting that other mineralogical or physical parameters are also controlling the 860 nm absorption. Here, we examine Mastcam and ChemCam passive reflectance spectra from VRR and other locations to link the depth, position, and presence or absence of iron-related mineralogic absorption features to the XRD-derived rock mineralogy. Correlating CheMin mineralogy to spectral parameters showed that the ~860 nm absorption has a strong positive correlation with the abundance of ferric phyllosilicates. New laboratory reflectance measurements of powdered mineral mixtures can reproduce trends found in Gale crater. We hypothesize that variations in the 860 nm absorption feature in Mastcam and ChemCam observations of VRR materials are a result of three factors: (1) variations in ferric phyllosilicate abundance due to its ~800-1,000 nm absorption; (2) variations in clinopyroxene abundance because of its band maximum at ~860 nm; and (3) the presence of red crystalline hematite because of its absorption centered at 860 nm. We also show that relatively small changes in Ca-sulfate abundance is one potential cause of the erosional resistance and geomorphic expression of VRR.",

  "abstract": "Aeolian ripples are common in sandy environments on Earth and Mars. On Earth, ripples in sorted dune sands typically are &lt;1 cm high and are erased in high winds. On Mars in similar sands, ripple wavelengths commonly exceed 2 m, with much smaller ripples superimposed. Large Martian ripple sizes and juxtaposition of multiple wavelengths have raised questions about origins and the applicability of terrestrial aeolian physics to different planetary environments. Here, two hypotheses are evaluated for large Martian ripples: (1) fluid/wind drag, analogous to ripples formed under water on Earth, as proposed previously for Martian large ripples; and (2) saltation impact splash, the mechanism creating aeolian ripples of much smaller size on Earth. This study evaluates these hypotheses with numerical experiments and Mars rover observations, and concludes that large Martian ripples develop through the saltation impact splash mechanism. The low-density Martian atmosphere enables aeolian impact ripples to grow much higher into the boundary layer before reaching maximum heights constrained by wind dynamic pressure effects at crests. In this concept, boundary layer conditions influence mature ripple heights more directly than wavelengths. On Mars, low wind dynamic pressures, combined with the impact splash mechanism, also help to explain other distinctively Martian aeolian bedforms, including large longitudinal ripples observed by rovers and orbiters, and transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) distributed widely across the Martian surface. Compared with Earth, low wind dynamic pressures on Mars permit a wider range of ripple sizes, relative ages, morphologies, and orientations in close proximity, as displayed in rover observations.",

  "abstract": "Gravity wave (GW) activity in the lower and middle atmosphere of Mars during the global dust storm of 2018 has been studied for the first time using a high-resolution (GW-resolving) general circulation model. Dust storm simulations were compared with those utilizing the climatological distribution of dust in the absence of storms. Both scenarios are based on observations of the dust optical depth by the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The modeling reveals a reduction of the wave activity by a factor of 2 or more in the lower atmosphere, which qualitatively agrees with recent observations. It is associated with a decline of GW generation due to baroclinic and convective stabilization of the Martian troposphere induced by the increased amount of airborne aerosols during the storm. Contrary to the decrease of GW activity in the lower atmosphere, wave energy and momentum fluxes in the middle atmosphere increase by approximately the same factor. This enhancement of GW activity is caused by the changes in the large-scale circulation, most importantly in the mean zonal wind, which facilitate vertical wave propagation by allowing for a greater portion of GW harmonics originated in the lower atmosphere to avoid filtering on their way to upper layers.",

  "abstract": "The moon Dione orbits Saturn at 6.2 Saturn radii R<SUB>S</SUB> deep in the Kronian magnetosphere. In situ studies of the moon-magnetosphere interaction processes near Dione were possible with the Cassini/Huygens mission which flew by close to Dione five times at distances between 99 and 516 km. In addition, Cassini crossed Dione's L-shell more than 400 times between 2004 and 2017 and documented the variability of Saturn's magnetosphere. Different flyby geometries allowed to study the interaction processes upstream, in the low-energy wake, and above the north pole of Dione. We describe here the energetic particle measurements from the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini. We also use hybrid simulation results from \"A.I.K.E.F.\" to interpret the signatures in the particle fluxes. This paper is a continuation of Krupp et al. (2013, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.06.007\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.06.007</A>) and Kotova et al.

The key results are as follows: (1) Saturn's magnetosphere at Dione's orbit is highly variable with changes in energetic charged particle fluxes by 1-2 orders of magnitude. (2) The dropout signatures near Dione are basically consistent with a fully absorbing obstacle, but some features point to more complex interaction processes than plasma and energetic particle absorption. (3) Absorption signatures are found to be asymmetric with respect to the orientation of the moon, indicative of the presence of radial drift components for electrons. (4) The deepest absorption signatures were observed at the edge of the low-energy wake pointing to gradient-B drifts strongest in that part of the interaction region.",

  "abstract": "Mercury's nightside magnetosphere is investigated under the impact of a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a high-speed stream (HSS) with MErcury Surface, Space ENviroment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) observations. The CME was shown to produce a low plasma β (ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) magnetosheath, while the HSS creates a higher β magnetosheath. Reconnection at the dayside magnetopause was found to be stronger during the CME than the HSS, but both were stronger than the average condition (Slavin et al., 2014, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020319\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020319</A>). Here we show that the CME and HSS events produced large numbers of flux ropes and dipolarization fronts in the plasma sheet. The occurrence rates for the structures were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than under average conditions with the rates during CME's being twice that of HSS's. The flux ropes appeared as quasiperiodic flux rope groups. Each group lasted approximately 1 min and had a few large flux ropes followed by several smaller flux ropes. The lobe magnetic flux accounted for around half of the Mercury's available magnetic flux with the flux during CME's being larger than that of HSS's. The CME produced a more dynamic nightside magnetosphere than the HSS. Further, for the CME event, the tail magnetic reconnection produced a distorted Hall magnetic field pattern and the X-line had a dawn-dusk extent of 20% of the tail width. No magnetic flux loading and unloading events were observed suggesting that, during these intense driving conditions, Mercury's magnetosphere responded with a type of quasi-steady convection as opposed to the tail flux loading-unloading events seen at Earth.",

  "abstract": "We use magnetopause crossings of the Cassini spacecraft to study the response of Saturn's magnetosphere to changes in external and internal drivers. We explain how solar wind pressure can be corrected to account for the local variability in internal plasma particle pressure. The physics-based method is applied to perform the most robust estimation of magnetopause compressibility at Saturn to date, using 7 years' worth of magnetometer data from the Cassini mission and accounting for variable internal drivers—particle pressure and azimuthal ring current. The concept of magnetopause compressibility is generalized to quantitatively account for its detailed variation with respect to the position of the magnetopause. An analytical fit is provided to map the compressibility index to values of the stand-off distance. In particular, the procedure shows that the Kronian system appears to behave similarly to that of Jupiter when expanded outwards and more like the Earth's magnetopause when compressed.",

  "abstract": "For decades, radio remote-sensing techniques have been used to probe the plasma structure of the solar corona at distances of 2 - 20 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Measurement of Faraday rotation, the change in the polarization position angle of linearly polarized radiation as it propagates through a magnetized plasma, has proven to be one of the best methods for determining the coronal magnetic-field strength and structure. Faraday-rotation observations of spatially extended radio sources provide the unique opportunity to measure differential Faraday rotation [Δ RM] the difference in the Faraday-rotation measure between two closely spaced lines of sight (LOS) through the corona. Δ RM is proportional to the electric current within an Ampèrian loop formed, in part, by the two closely spaced LOS. We report the expected Δ RM for two sets of models for the corona: one set of models for the corona employs a spherically symmetric plasma density, while the other breaks this symmetry by assuming that the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is a finite-width streamer-belt region containing a high-density plasma. For each plasma-density model, we evaluate the Δ RM for three model coronal magnetic fields: a radial dipole and interplanetary magnetic field (DIMF), a dipole + current sheet (DCS), and a dipole + quadrupole + current sheet (DQCS). These models predict values of 0.01 ≲Δ RM ≲120 radm-<SUP>2</SUP> over the range of parameter space accessible by modern instruments such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We conclude that the HCS contribution to Δ RM is not negligible at moderate heliocentric distances (&lt;8 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and may account for ≲20 % of previous observations of Δ RM (e.g. made by Spangler, Astrophys. J.670, 841, 2007).",

  "abstract": "So far no designated mission to either of the two ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, exists. Almost all of our gathered information on these planets comes from remote sensing. In recent years, NASA and ESA have started planning for future mission to Uranus and Neptune, with both agencies focusing their attention on orbiters and atmospheric probes. Whereas information provided by remote sensing is undoubtedly highly valuable, remote sensing of planetary atmospheres also presents some shortcomings, most of which can be overcome by mass spectrometers. In most studies presented to date a mass spectrometer experiment is thus a favored science instrument for in situ composition measurements on an atmospheric probe. Mass spectrometric measurements can provide unique scientific data, i.e., sensitive and quantitative measurements of the chemical composition of the atmosphere, including isotopic, elemental, and molecular abundances. In this review paper we present the technical aspects of mass spectrometry relevant to atmospheric probes. This includes the individual components that make up mass spectrometers and possible implementation choices for each of these components. We then give an overview of mass spectrometers that were sent to space with the intent of probing planetary atmospheres, and discuss three instruments, the heritage of which is especially relevant to Uranus and Neptune probes, in detail. The main part of this paper presents the current state-of-art in mass spectrometry intended for atmospheric probe. Finally, we present a possible descent probe implementation in detail, including measurement phases and associated expected accuracies for selected species.",

Fissures crosscut all known terrains, including (apparently) ejecta of bright ray crater Manannan, establishing that fissures and by inference TPW are among the most recent geologic events on Europa. Very late ~70° of TPW shell rotation requires that most observed structures on Europa are not in their original configuration with respect to other stress regimes, requiring complete reanalysis of Europa's strain history.

Because these ions can significantly alter the structure and stability of the magnetotail current sheet, the characteristics of this outflow are important for accurate magnetosphere modeling, including modeling of substorms—a key element of magnetosphere dynamics. Using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft measurements in the magnetotail (around the plasma sheet boundary), we investigate characteristics oxygen outflows observed during substorm growth phases. The observed oxygen ion temperature and flow energy indicate that the outflow is marginally stable to ion acoustic wave generation: The oxygen temperature is slightly lower than the electron temperature and slightly higher than the oxygen flow energy. Moreover, the observed outflows are accompanied by low frequency electrostatic waves that may contribute to outflow thermalization. The oxygen bulk velocity has a significant component directed toward the equatorial plane, originating from the cross-field drift in the convection electric field. The estimated radial distances at which oxygen ions reach the plasma sheet are ∼20-40R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail, that is, outflows during substorm growth phases can alter current sheet characteristics around the potential magnetic reconnection region.",

  "abstract": "Response of the Martian upper thermosphere to the lower atmospheric dust activity is studied using unique observations made together by the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. The Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyzer (MENCA)/MOM and the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS)/MAVEN have simultaneously (on the same day) measured the neutral densities in the Martian thermosphere on 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 29 June 2018. The measurement period falls in the onset and progression time of the planet-encircling dust event (PEDE) in the Mars lower atmosphere. During this time, the inbound trajectories of MAVEN and MOM spacecraft occurred on the dawnside and duskside, respectively. Using these observations, we found that thermospheric densities both on the dawnside and duskside are enhanced associated with the onset and growth of PEDE-2018. The enhancement, however, is more on the duskside than on the dawn, showing the dawn-dusk asymmetry. The densities on the duskside reach their maximum on 29 June 2018, close to the time of peak dust activity. These results are explained by considering the local time asymmetries in radiative heating of the lower atmosphere and subsequent expansion of the thermosphere due to PEDE-2018. Furthermore, O/CO<SUB>2</SUB> ratios below 220-km altitude become one on the dawnside, whereas they are always &lt;0.2 at the dusk. This indicates that radiative cooling is more effective on the dawnside than the duskside.",

  "abstract": "Ionosphere is the upper atmosphere region that contains sufficient number of electrons which disturb the propagation of radio signal travel from navigational satellite to ground/user receiver. Ionospheric delay in range measurement is related to its Total Electron Content (TEC). Ionospheric delay results in range error and degrades the user position accuracy of navigational satellite systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS). Hence a suitable TEC prediction model to correct the range delay in single frequency range measurement is necessary. In dual frequency receiver, ionospheric delay is estimated and eliminated using the two range measurements performed at the same time. This paper describes the TEC prediction methodology using Ordinary Kriging based Surrogate Model (OKSM). OKSM is evaluated using the data received and collected from the IRNSS receiver station installed at ACS College of Engineering (ACSCE), Bengaluru (12.8913 °N, 77.4658 °E), India and other International GNSS Service (IGS) network stations. IRNSS TEC data (January 2018) is calculated by using dual frequency (L5 &amp; S) pseudo range method and TEC is smoothed by normal cubic smoothing spline method. IRNSS Vertical TEC (VTEC) is predicted from 16 January 2018 to 26 January 2018 by using previous six days of estimated VTEC values. Similarly, GPS VTEC for IGS station at IISC, Bengaluru is also predicted for same duration to validate the developed OKSM. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed forecasting model for different geographic locations, solar activity conditions and seasons, the VTEC is predicted and analyzed for different latitude regions such as low-latitude PHON station (6.9599 °N, 158.2101 °E), mid-latitude ALGO station (45.9588 °N, -78.0714 °E) and high-latitude NRIL station (69.3618 °N, 88.3597 °E) during different solar activity conditions (Low-2008, Medium-2011 and High-2013 solar activity) and during different seasons (spring, summer, rainy and winter) in the year 2017. From the analysis of OKSM prediction results, it is observed that, RMSE of predicted TEC varies from 0.79 to 3.6 TECU, MAE is 0.4 to 3 TECU and MAPE is within 40% for ionospheric quiet days. VTEC is also predicted during storm days (26 October 2003 to 31 October 2003). To study the performance of the model, VTEC prediction results of OKSM are compared with prediction results from Standard Persistence Model (SPM) and VTEC derived from International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2016) model. The RMSE of OKSM is 1.9679 TECU, MAE is 1.245 TECU and MAPE is 9%, whereas for SPM, RMSE is 4.8372 TECU, MAE is 3.7496 TECU and MAPE is 36%. Similarly, for IRI-2016 model, RMSE is 7.9 TECU, MAE is 7.1976 TECU and MAPE is 66%. Therefore, TEC predictions by OKSM are better than SPM and IRI-2016. The results show that the OKSM is useful for applications in ionospheric studies.",

  "abstract": "While Saturn's largest moon Titan is devoid of an intrinsic magnetic field, draping of the giant planet's magnetospheric field around Titan's ionosphere generates a pile-up region at the moon's ramside. In this study, we analyze Cassini magnetic field data from all 126 Titan flybys to systematically characterize the extensions and magnitudes of the field enhancements at its ramside. Along each flyby trajectory, the segments where Cassini crossed the piled-up magnetic field are determined, and altitude profiles of the pile-up strength are also generated. We investigate the dependency of the extension and strength of the pile-up region on various parameters, such as the Saturn local time and the magnetospheric environment to which Titan is exposed. In this way, we generate a comprehensive picture of Titan's ramside magnetic pile-up region during the Cassini era. Our major findings are: (1) The extensions of the observed pile-up reveal an asymmetry between the Saturn-facing and Saturn-averted sides caused by the large gyro-radii of ionospheric pick-up ions. (2) The observed pile-up radial extensions are nearly independent of Titan's orbital position. (3) The lower boundary of the pile-up region is located at an altitude of 0.35 Titan radius, denoting the average altitude of the magnetic ionopause. (4) Considering the error bars, the altitude profiles of the pile-up strength show a stable picture, i.e., the radial profile of the field magnitude is independent of Saturn's magnetospheric environment and local time.",

  "abstract": "Transient magnetic reconnection and associated fast plasma flows led by dipolarization fronts play a crucial role in energetic particle acceleration in planetary magnetospheres. Despite large statistical observations on this phenomenon in the Earth's magnetotail, many important characteristics (e.g., mass or charge dependence of acceleration efficiency and acceleration scaling with the spatial scale of the system) of transient reconnection cannot be fully investigated with the limited parameter range of the Earth's magnetotail. The much larger Jovian magnetodisk, filled by a mixture of various heavy ions and protons, provides a unique opportunity for such investigations. In this study, we use recent Juno observations in Jupiter's magnetosphere to examine the properties of reconnection associated dipolarization fronts and charged particle acceleration. High-energy fluxes of sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen ions show clear mass-dependent acceleration with energy ∼m<SUP>1/3</SUP>. We compare Juno observations with similar observations in the Earth's magnetotail and discuss possible mechanism for the observed ion acceleration.",

  "abstract": "The international Mars Exploration community has been planning to return samples from Mars for many years; the next decade should see the plans becoming a reality. Mars Sample Return (MSR) requires a series of missions, first to collect the samples, then to return them to Earth, whilst preventing the contamination of both Earth and Mars. The first mission in the campaign, Mars 2020, will land at Jezero Crater in early 2021; samples should return to Earth sometime after 2032. The information to be derived from analysis of martian samples in terrestrial laboratories equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation is more than recompense for the difficulties of the MSR campaign. Results from analyses of returned samples will enable increased understanding of martian geological (and possibly biological) evolution. They will facilitate preparations for human exploration of Mars and by providing a second set of absolute ages for a planetary surface will validate (or otherwise) application of the lunar crater-age scale throughout the Solar System.",

  "abstract": "The nature of ionospheric losses from Venus is of essential importance for understanding the ionosphere dynamics of this unmagnetized planet. A plausible mechanism that can explain the escape of charged particles involves the solar wind interaction with the upper atmospheric layers of Venus. The hydrodynamic approach proposed for plasma expansion in the present study comprises two populations of positive ions and the neutralizing electrons, which interact with the solar wind electrons and protons. The fluid equations describing the plasma are solved numerically using a self-similar approach. The behavior of plasma density, velocity, and electric potential, as well as their reliance upon solar wind parameters have been examined. It is found that for noon midnight sites, the oxygen ion-to-electron relative density may be the main factor to enhance the ionic loss. However, the other parameters, like hydrogen density and solar wind density and velocity seem to do not stimulate the runaway ions. For lower dawn-dusk region, the plasma are composed of hydrogen and oxygen ions as well as electrons, but for higher altitudes only hydrogen ions and electrons are encountered. All ionic densities play an important role either to reduce or boost the ionic loss. The streaming solar wind velocity has no effect on the plasma escaping for lower altitudes, but it reduces the expansion at higher altitudes.",

  "abstract": "&lt;abstract xml:lang=\"en\" type=\"main\"&gt;Early gravity measurements performed by the Juno spacecraft determined Jupiter's low-degree gravity harmonics, including the first estimate of the planet's north-south asymmetric field. The retrieved information was used to infer that the strong zonal winds visible at the cloud tops must extend down a few thousand kilometers, where they are suppressed in the deep interior. The next frontier for the Juno gravity experiment includes, among other goals, the determination of Jupiter's small-scale gravity field with high accuracy, and its relation to atmospheric circulation at shorter length scales. The geometry of the Juno closest approaches to the planet poses a challenge to this task, as they span latitudes between 4°N and 29°N over the course of the nominal mission. Since Doppler measurements are the most sensitive to gravity anomalies when the spacecraft is close to the body, observations of Jupiter's gravity field are mostly concentrated in the northern hemisphere, while the traditional spherical harmonic functions are not orthonormal over a latitudinal subdomain. Here we define customized Slepian functions, which are orthogonal in a specific latitude range and are optimized to represent Jupiter's local surface gravity at north latitudes. We show that with the new functions, the short-scale latitudinal variability of the gravity field is resolved with high accuracy between 15°S and 45°N latitude. Furthermore, preliminary results show that the estimated values for the Slepian coefficients from the Juno data match the predictions obtained using thermal wind balance to relate the dynamical density anomalies and the winds with an optimized scale height.&lt;abstract xml:lang=\"en\" type=\"synopsis\"&gt;Among the main scientific objectives of NASA's Juno mission is the determination of Jupiter's gravity field with high accuracy. The measurements are related to the planet's internal mass distribution and carry information about its structure and dynamics below the visible clouds. Gravity science observations from the first few close flybys of the spacecraft allowed for the determination of the long-scale, global gravity field of the planet with unprecedented accuracy. On the other hand, the determination of the short-scale, localized gravity field is challenging when using the traditional spherical harmonic function basis used in planetary geodesy. In fact, these functions are defined globally, whereas the Juno observations are geographically limited to the northern hemisphere. In this work we use the Slepian function basis, which is defined over a limited latitudinal region of the planet, to resolve the small scale variability of the northern gravity field of Jupiter.&lt;abstract xml:lang=\"en\" type=\"short\"&gt;&lt;list xml:id=\"jgre21490-list-0001\" style=\"bulleted\"&gt;&lt;listItem xml:id=\"jgre21490-li-0001\"&gt;Slepian orthonormal functions are used to estimate the localized short-scale gravity field of Jupiter using Juno observations&lt;listItem xml:id=\"jgre21490-li-0002\"&gt;The determination of Jupiter's gravity field is tailored to the geometry of the Juno orbit&lt;listItem xml:id=\"jgre21490-li-0003\"&gt;The measured localized short-scale gravity field of Jupiter matches the prediction from a thermal wind model of the zonal jets&lt;/list&gt;",

  "abstract": "This paper describes NASA's innovative approach to assess and mitigate astronaut health and performance risks for space exploration missions beyond Low-Earth Orbit, with Mars as the focal destination. As human space missions gradually become more autonomous and complex to reach the Mars goal, the original risk management methodology falls short of providing accurate risk evaluations for the development of the corresponding countermeasures. A more systematic and refined approach is required to manage all the risks related to in-mission astronaut health and productivity, as well as the long-term effects on terrestrial quality of life after landing. Another important aspect of this new method is the ability to stratify all the human system risks relative to each other so effective tradeoffs can be made resulting in an optimized set of medical and performance competencies for future space mission architectures. The management of these risks at the portfolio level is based on several factors, not just Likelihood versus Consequence (LxC) scoring and its corresponding color: Red, Yellow, or Green. First, the resultant LxC score for each mission should include the respective level of uncertainty in the scoring. This uncertainty is determined by the evidence source, which ranges from cellular terrestrial to human inflight, the evidence type ranging from case study to causation, and the number of studies yielding similar results. Second, the risk characterization or \"risk state of knowledge\" should include the effectiveness level of current countermeasures to determine the need for further mitigation strategies. Third, the cost versus benefit evaluation of additional mitigation should be stacked against specific mission schedules; this will determine if the pending product development timelines meet mission deadlines. There is no immediate benefit in investing in technology development if the products will not be ready for the intended mission. Lastly, the subject matter experts and risk decision makers should review all the components of the previous evidence and debate in a formal setting the most sensible path forward to manage these risks, as every decision is important and unique. The decision process, with all pertinent parties involved, should provide insight into the possible negative effects of implementing a particular countermeasure on other human system risks; thus, the implementation of a particular mitigation should not increase the overall risk posture of the entire portfolio. The following content describes this methodology and its impact to assessing NASA's missions.",

  "abstract": "We examine the final 44 orbits of the Cassini spacecraft traversing the midnight sector of Saturn's magnetosphere to distances of ~21 Saturn radii, to investigate responses to heliospheric conditions inferred from model solar wind and Cassini galactic cosmic ray flux data. Clear storm responses to anticipated magnetospheric compressions are observed in magnetic field and energetic particle data, together with Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR), auroral hiss, and ultraviolet auroral emissions. Most compression events are associated with corotating interaction regions, producing ~2-3.5 day intervals of magnetospheric activity that are recurrent with the ~26 day solar rotation period (one or two such events per rotation), though one on the final pass is related to a nonrecurrent interplanetary shock possibly associated with an earlier X-class solar flare. The response to compressions is modulated by the concurrent relative phasing of the northern and southern planetary period oscillation (PPO) systems, with long (&gt;1 planetary rotation) SKR low-frequency extension (LFE) intervals associated with strong field-aligned coupling currents being favored when the two PPO systems act together to thin and thicken the tail plasma sheet during each PPO cycle. LFE onsets/intensifications are then favored at thin plasma sheet phases most unstable to reconnection, producing energetic nightside particle injections and poleward contractions of dawn-brightened auroras. Correspondingly, solar rotation recurrent intervals of magnetospheric quiet conditions also occur with weak energetic particle fluxes and auroral emissions, associated with extended solar wind rarefactions. Overall, the results emphasize how strongly activity in Saturn's magnetosphere is modulated by concurrent heliospheric conditions.",

  "abstract": "Lower hybrid waves are investigated at the magnetosheath separatrix region in asymmetric guide field reconnection by using the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Three of the four MMS spacecraft observe clear wave activities around the lower hybrid frequency across the magnetosheath separatrix, where a density gradient is present. The observed waves are consistent with generation by the lower hybrid drift instability. The characteristic properties of these waves include the following: (1) the waves propagate toward the x-line in the spacecraft frame due to the large out-of-plane magnetic field, which is in the same direction of the diamagnetic drift of the x-line; (2) the wave potential is about 20% of the electron temperature. These drift waves effectively produce cross-field particle diffusion, enabling the transport of magnetosheath electrons into the exhaust region. At last, we suggest that the lower hybrid waves at the magnetosheath separatrix region represent some unique features of asymmetric guide field reconnection, which is different from that widely observed at the magnetospheric side of magnetopause reconnection.",

  "abstract": "Two areas on Mars in the old Thaumasia region were analysed, where interaction between fluvial and tectonic landforms provided conditions to improve age estimation for valley network formation. An Earth analog terrain was also involved in this work at Villány Hills (Hungary) for reference and to see the relations in tectonic-fluvial interaction. On Mars such interaction was observed by morphology (parallel curvatures of neighbour valleys) and by the comparison of statistical analyses of the fluvial and tectonic lineaments' azimuthal orientation. While in the case of Mars the fluvial network elements' distribution closely follows that of the tectonic elements' distribution, in the case of the Earth the connection is weaker. The comparison gives an interesting example for tectonic landforms controlling fluvial valley orientations, occasionally producing resembling features in valley tracks, influencing the sediment transport and the locations of deposits. <P />Because the tectonic faults crossed a much larger area than the fluvial valleys they influenced, crater size frequency distribution based ages could be better measured with them. Using this approach, we found the minimal age of the fluvial network formation to be around 3.7 Ga (or up to 3.9 Ga). This result demonstrates that the small, scattered, and poorly integrated valleys might also have formed at the same period as the larger, branching systems with well determined ages: around the Noachian/Hesperian transition. Thus valley network formation even in the case of small, non-integrated systems might not necessarily extend into the early or middle Noachian ages and might have happened at a potential climatic optimum around 3.7 Ga ago. However the most difficult task remains the exact dating of old and small valleys at other locations on Mars, to confirm this possibility.",

MOXIE will produce oxygen from atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> on Mars. It is being developed for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover and will produce greater than 99.6% pure oxygen through solid oxide electrolysis. MOXIE is roughly 0.5% of the scale that would be necessary to produce oxygen for breathing and use as a propellant for a human Mars mission. <P />Tests are being performed on MOXIE in the laboratory at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At the same time, a model is being developed to simulate and predict the performance of MOXIE. The ability to predict the performance of MOXIE on Mars is a critical step in preparation for surface operations. Without the ability to estimate inefficient or unsafe operating conditions, MOXIE operations on Mars run a spectrum of risk ranging from loss of efficiency to the loss of the entire mission. Therefore, to predict performance and thus avoid subjecting flight hardware to unsafe conditions, a dynamic model has been developed that simulates MOXIE's operation. Simulink, a package contained within the MATLAB programming language, was chosen as a convenient way to build this dynamic representation of MOXIE. The model is a combination of theoretical and empirical values regarding the gas flows, thermal transfers, electrochemistry, and control loops that are representative of the true MOXIE system. The results of this model have been validated against data from JPL's MOXIE testbed laboratory. <P />This paper gives an overview of how MOXIE works and how it is modeled. MOXIE is the first instrument of its kind to leave the Earth, and the modeling of this instrument is similarly unique. As the dynamic model continues to evolve with new data, it becomes a fast and inexpensive way to test MOXIE without subjecting expensive hardware to hazardous conditions.",

  "abstract": "We conducted numerical simulations to examine dayside thermosphere and ionosphere responses to concurrent solar flares and a geomagnetic storm during 6-11 September 2017, as well as the interplay of flare and storm effects. We found that E-region electron density response to the flares was much smaller inside the auroral oval than it was outside the auroral oval due to an extra source of ionization by auroral particle precipitation. During quiet times in this period, flare enhanced ionization, which decreased daytime eastward electric fields, caused an initial weakening of the vertical E × B drifts. This weakening of the vertical E × B drifts was on the order of ~20% for an X8.2 flare in this period. During storm times, flare-induced initial changes of the vertical plasma drifts varied between being positive and being negative, depending on latitudes, due to storm-time disturbance dynamo effects. Storm effects also overall weakened flare effects on geopotential height, ionospheric F<SUB>2</SUB> peak height hmF<SUB>2</SUB>, and ionospheric F<SUB>2</SUB> peak electron density NmF<SUB>2</SUB>. In addition, storm effects changed the latitudinal distributions of flare effects on hmF<SUB>2</SUB>, NmF<SUB>2</SUB>, vertical plasma drifts, and O/N<SUB>2</SUB>. On the other hand, no major X-class flare occurred shortly before or during the storm. Model simulations indicate that the weaker C- and M-class flares that occurred before and during the storm had a minor effect on the amplitude of the large-scale traveling atmosphere disturbances generated by the storm.",

  "abstract": "Jupiter's giant magnetosphere is a complex system seldom in a configuration approximating steady state, and a clear picture of its governing dynamics remains elusive. Crucial to understanding how the magnetosphere behaves on a large scale are disturbances to the system on length-scales comparable to the cavity, which are communicated by magnetohydrodynamic waves in the ultralow-frequency band (&lt;1 mHz). In this study we used magnetometer data from multiple spacecraft to perform the first global heritage survey of these waves in the magnetosphere. To map the equatorial region, we relied on the large local-time coverage provided by the Galileo spacecraft. Flyby encounters performed by Voyager 1 and 2, Pioneer 10 and 11, and Ulysses provided local-time coverage of the dawn sector. We found several hundred events where significant wave power was present, with periods spanning ∼5-60 min. The majority of events consisted of multiple superposed discrete periods. Periods at ∼15, ∼30, and ∼40 min dominated the event-averaged spectrum, consistent with the spectra of quasi-periodic pulsations often reported in the literature. Most events were clustered in the outer magnetosphere close to the magnetopause at noon and dusk, suggesting that an external driving mechanism may dominate. The most energetic events occurred close to the planet, though more sporadically, indicating an accumulation of wave energy in the inner magnetosphere or infrequent impulsive drivers in the region. Our findings suggest that dynamics of the system at large scales is modulated by this diverse population of waves, which permeate the magnetosphere through several cavities and wave guides.",

  "abstract": "The future Europa Clipper NASA mission to Europa will carry the MAss Spectrometer for Planetary EXploration (MASPEX), which will analyze the compounds making up Europa's exosphere, and plumes, if present. Europa's exosphere is likely to feature abundant atomic oxygen, a product of sputtering of Europa's surface by energetic particles from Jupiter's radiation belts, or photolysis of oxygen-bearing molecules in the exosphere. Due to its very high reactivity, this atomic oxygen could induce chemical processes within MASPEX. These processes could involve materials composing the instrument, or other compounds from Europa's exosphere. In both cases, the possible effect on the instrument's measurements is a concern. In this work we first review previous relevant experiments on the effect of atomic oxygen on several candidate metals and conclude that stainless steel with a gold coating is the most satisfactory choice for MASPEX's antechamber walls, and alumina for the impact plate. We then perform simulations of adsorption/desorption processes within the instrument's antechamber to bound the effect of atomic oxygen on other compounds from Europa's exosphere. We find that the accumulation of atomic oxygen during a flyby would lead to a reduction of the apparent abundance of water by as much as 0.125% (Δ[H<SUB>2</SUB>O]/[H<SUB>2</SUB>O] = -1.25 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>). Evaluating the exact extent of this effect during data post-processing would require constraining the atomic oxygen abundance, which would have to be achieved with other instruments, such as the ultraviolet spectrometer.",

  "abstract": "LaRa (Lander Radioscience) is an experiment on the ExoMars 2020 mission that uses the Doppler shift on the radio link due to the motion of the ExoMars platform tied to the surface of Mars with respect to the Earth ground stations (e.g. the deep space network stations of NASA), in order to precisely measure the relative velocity of the lander on Mars with respect to the Earth. The LaRa measurements shall improve the understanding of the structure and processes in the deep interior of Mars by obtaining the rotation and orientation of Mars with a better precision compared to the previous missions. In this paper, we provide the analysis done until now for the best realization of these objectives. We explain the geophysical observation that will be reached with LaRa (Length-of-day variations, precession, nutation, and possibly polar motion). We develop the experiment set up, which includes the ground stations on Earth (so-called ground segment). We describe the instrument, i.e. the transponder and its three antennas. We further detail the link budget and the expected noise level that will be reached. Finally, we detail the expected results, which encompasses the explanation of how we shall determine Mars' orientation parameters, and the way we shall deduce Mars' interior structure and Mars' atmosphere from them. Lastly, we explain briefly how we will be able to determine the Surface platform position.",

  "abstract": "We have developed a new procedure for combining lists of substorm onset times from multiple sources. We apply this procedure to observational data and to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model output from 1-31 January 2005. We show that this procedure is capable of rejecting false positive identifications and filling data gaps that appear in individual lists. The resulting combined onset lists produce a waiting time distribution that is comparable to previously published results, and superposed epoch analyses of the solar wind driving conditions and magnetospheric response during the resulting onset times are also comparable to previous results. Comparison of the substorm onset list from the MHD model to that obtained from observational data reveals that the MHD model reproduces many of the characteristic features of the observed substorms, in terms of solar wind driving, magnetospheric response, and waiting time distribution. Heidke skill scores show that the MHD model has statistically significant skill in predicting substorm onset times.",

  "abstract": "Layers of dayside ionospheric plasma have been sporadically observed on Mars at 90 km altitude. Several causes for these layers have been proposed. Here we test the hypothesis that solar energetic particle (SEP) events produce these layers. Several independent lines of evidence show that SEP events do increase plasma densities at low altitudes. We compare the occurrence of low-altitude plasma layers to a proxy for the flux of solar energetic particles at Mars. For the ionospheric layers, we use 71 instances of low-altitude plasma layers found in 5,600 electron density profiles acquired by Mars Global Surveyor. For the proxy for solar energetic particle flux, we use the flux recorded in the highest energy channel of the Mars Global Surveyor Electron Reflectometer. We find that these low-altitude plasma layers are not significantly more likely to occur during SEP events.",

  "abstract": "Observations of local features in the solar chromosphere began in 1992 at Huairou Solar Observing Station, while the full-disk chromosphere observations were carried out since 2000. In order to facilitate researchers to use full-disk chromosphere observation, algorithms have been developed to standardize the full-disk images. The algorithms include the determination of the center of the image and size standardization, geometric correction and intensity normalization. The solar limb of each image is determined from a histogram analysis of its intensity distribution. The center and radius are then calculated and the image is corrected for geometric distortions. Images are re-scaled to have a fixed radius of 500 pixels and centered within the 1024 × 1024 frame. Finally, large-scale variations in intensity, such as limb-darkening, are removed using a median filter. This paper provides a detailed description of these algorithms, and a summary of the properties of these chromospheric full-disk observations to be used for further scientific investigations.",

  "abstract": "Since 1892, when an aurora was first imaged by Martin Brendel, a German physicist, auroral forms and their dynamics have been acquired only when the aurora is in darkness. Due to the sunlight contamination from Rayleigh scattering, it has been a long-term challenge of imaging sunlit aurora. In addition, other constraints exist, such as moonlight contamination, cloud occultation, and the limited land area available for installing imagers near the auroral zone in both hemispheres. While auroral imaging from space provides auroral global dynamics or small-scale structures, depending on the spacecraft orbit, the image quality is affected by low spatial and temporal resolutions, sunlight, and the lack of traceability of auroral variations. Consequently, we have little knowledge of sunlit auroral forms and their dynamics, as well as their coupling to conjugate aurora. Given the fact that the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is initiated on the dayside, understanding sunlit and dayside aurorae becomes very interesting and important. A scenario of imaging sunlit aurora from a balloon and the conceptual design of the instrument have been depicted in our previous article (Zhou et al., 2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL028611\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL028611</A>). This paper elaborates the new science enabled by this new means and the feasibility of auroral ballooning by showing some sunlit auroral images obtained from a balloon flight and calculations of the corresponding sky brightness. In addition, we describe and explain the most important specs of the new NIR camera-head being developed for the BALBOA balloon mission that is currently supported by the NASA/Low Cost Access to Space program.",

  "abstract": "This paper characterizes the impacts of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) and mesospheric coolings (MCs) on the light species distribution (i.e., helium [He], and atomic hydrogen [H]) of the thermosphere using a combined data-modeling approach. Performing a set of numerical experiments with a general circulation model whose middle atmospheric dynamical and thermodynamical fields were constrained using a numerical weather prediction system, we simulate the effects of SSWs and MCs on light chemical species, and via comparisons with two data sets taken from the mesosphere and thermosphere, we quantify the associated variability in light species abundances and mass density. Large depletions in the observed and modeled polar H abundance in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) occur with MC onset, as opposed to SSW onset. Depletions in all light thermospheric species at high northern latitudes extend up to the exobase in our model simulations during the January 2013 SSW/MC period, with the largest depletions simulated for the lightest species. Further, our modeling work substantiates the paradigm of increased mixing in the MLT driven by a meridional residual circulation during SSWs resulting from enhanced small-scale gravity wave and migrating semidiurnal tidal forcing; the former being the primary driver and the latter of secondary but notable importance in our model simulations. SSW/MC induced light species variability then gets projected upward into the thermosphere through molecular diffusion. Modeled light species variability during the January 2013 SSW/MC event suggests SSW/MC signatures could be present in the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere.",

  "abstract": "We present a new version of the high-resolution Kühlungsborn Mechanistic general Circulation Model (KMCM) extended to z ∼ 450 km. This model is called HIAMCM (HI Altitude Mechanistic general Circulation Model) and explicitly simulates gravity waves (GWs) down to horizontal wavelengths of λ<SUB>h</SUB> ∼ 165 km. We find predominant tertiary GWs in the winter thermosphere at middle/high latitudes. These GWs typically have horizontal wavelengths λ<SUB>h</SUB> ∼ 300-1,100 km, ground-based periods ∼ 25-90 min, and intrinsic horizontal phase speeds c<SUB>Ih</SUB> ∼ 250-350 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Above z ∼ 200 km, the predominant GW horizontal propagation directions are roughly against the background winds from the diurnal tide; the GWs propagate mainly poleward at midnight, eastward at 6 local time (LT), equatorward at noon, and westward at 18 LT. Wintertime GWs at z ∼ 300 km having 165 km ≤ λ<SUB>h</SUB> ≤ 330 km create a large hot spot over the Southern Andes/Antarctic Peninsula that agrees well with quiet time satellite measurements. Due to cancelation effects, the time-averaged zonal mean Eliassen-Palm flux divergence from the resolved GWs in the thermosphere is negligible compared to that of the tides and compared to the zonal component of the time-averaged zonal mean ion drag. We also find that the thermospheric GWs dissipate mainly from macroturbulent diffusion and, above z ∼ 200 km, from molecular diffusion, whereas the tides dissipate mainly from ion drag. The averaged dissipative heating in the thermosphere due to tides is much stronger than that due to GWs.",

  "abstract": "In-Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) can reduce the mass and cost of planetary missions. The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE) on the Mars 2020 rover Perseverance will demonstrate ISRU on Mars for the first time by producing oxygen from atmospheric carbon dioxide via solid oxide electrolysis. To protect the solid oxide electrolysis subsystem from contamination by dust, a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter is used. However, the performance of HEPA filters in Martian atmospheric conditions is not well understood. The theory of filtration was reviewed in the context of filtration of Mars' atmosphere, and an experimental investigation was carried out to determine the dust loading rate and pressure drop as a function of dust loading and filtration velocity for a flight-representative pleated and baffled MOXIE HEPA filter using wind tunnels and Martian dust simulant. In simulated atmospheric conditions of 10.3 mbar carbon dioxide at room temperature with a horizontal wind speed of 3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> and filter inlet face velocity of 7.1 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>, the dust loading rate was (0.19 ± 0.02) mg m<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is likely a lower bound: analytical approaches estimate dust loading rates of up to approximately 20 mg m<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP>. The pressure drop Δ P (mbar) as a function of dust loading m (g m<SUP>-2</SUP>) and filtration velocity U<SUB>F</SUB> (cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>) was Δ P = am + b U<SUB>F</SUB>, where a = 0.0012(1)mbar (g m<SUP>-2</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP> (cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP> and b = 0.063(1) mbar (cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>. Due to operation outside the continuum flow regime, pressure drop increased with atmospheric pressure, unlike HEPA filters on Earth where pressure drop is independent of atmospheric pressure. Dust is unlikely to produce a problematic pressure drop for MOXIE, but needs to be considered for large-scale filtration if the benefits of atmospheric ISRU on Mars are to be fully realised.",

  "abstract": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) has been imaging the thermosphere and ionosphere since October 2018. It provides continuous measurements over a large area from its geostationary orbit. The unambiguous two-dimensional (2-D) maps of OI 135.6 nm radiance retrieved from GOLD after sunset are compared with the total electron content (TEC) maps measured by GPS receivers in the American sector. The OI 135.6 nm radiance observed by GOLD is an indicator of the peak electron density of the ionosphere F2 region, while the TEC is the total electron density in the column. Our comparisons show that the two data sets match each other very well in the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) morphology and its seasonal variability. Equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) are evident in GOLD nighttime OI 135.6 radiance. Corresponding depletions are shown in TEC maps, but without GOLD data as a reference, it is difficult to discern that the depletions are EPBs. In addition, both GOLD 135.6 radiance and TEC maps observed third peaks of electron density poleward of the southern EIA crests. Furthermore, both show that the ionosphere after sunset is quite dynamic and has strong day-to-day variability. In all, the GOLD and TEC have valuable synergy to allow us to gain a better understanding of the equatorial ionosphere.",

The structures with a stronger magnetic field are brighter at the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere levels as compared to the structures with a weaker magnetic field. K<SUB>1</SUB> minima separations are of greater value for the structures with a stronger magnetic field relative to the structures with a weaker magnetic field, whereas K<SUB>2</SUB> peaks separations demonstrate the opposite behavior.

The relation between shifts of K<SUB>1</SUB> minima and K<SUB>2</SUB> peak intensities for violet and red wings appeared to be weak.

Here we present a complete end-to-end observation by Wind, THEMIS, and Van Allen Probes missions during the main phase of the 23 February 2014 storm of a succession of solar wind rotational discontinuities decompressing the magnetosphere within 200 s, adiabatically decelerating the freshly injected &gt;10 keV protons, and thus suppressing the EMIC waves in the inner magnetosphere. Our results highlight the importance of solar wind conditions for the evolution of inner magnetospheric EMIC waves from a new perspective.",

  "abstract": "In the absence of a global magnetic field at Venus, its ionosphere is the obstacle to the flow of the solar wind resulting in the formation of a smaller bow shock and foreshock. Spacecraft observations and global hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) simulations have demonstrated that despite its smaller size, the foreshock at Venus has properties similar to those seen at its much larger terrestrial counterpart. This study employs global hybrid simulations and Venus Express observations to demonstrate the formation of foreshock bubbles (FBs) at Venus and examine their impacts on the Venusian ionosphere. Discovered at Earth, FBs form in response to backstreaming ion beams in the foreshock interacting with solar wind rotational or tangential discontinuities. They exhibit a hot, tenuous, and low magnetic field core bounded by a fast magnetosonic shock wave and the associated plasma sheath. Their sizes scale with the width of the foreshock and they are carried by the solar wind toward the bow shock. The results of the hybrid simulations show that despite the smaller size of the Venusian foreshock, FBs should form at this planet. A preliminary examination of the Venus Express data has shown the presence of a number of FB candidates, one of which is discussed here. Using the results of hybrid simulations we examine the impacts of FBs on the ionosphere and demonstrate their global consequences which exceed those of hot flow anomalies also formed as a result of the interaction between solar wind discontinuities and the Venusian bow shock.",

  "abstract": "Using measurements from the Van Allen Probes, we show that field-aligned fluxes of electrons energized by dispersive Alfvén waves (DAWs) are prominent in the inner magnetosphere during active conditions. These electrons have preferentially field-aligned anisotropies from 1.2 to &gt;2 at energies ranging from tens of electron volts to several kiloelectron volts (keV), with largest values being coincident with magnetic field dipolarizations. Comparisons reveal that DAW energy densities and Poynting fluxes are strongly correlated with precipitating electron energies and energy fluxes and also O<SUP>+</SUP> ion outflow energies. These observations yield empirical inner magnetosphere relations between the DAW and electron inputs and the O<SUP>+</SUP> ion outflow response, providing important constraints for models. They also suggest that DAWs play an important role in enhancing field-aligned electron input into the ionosphere that facilitates the outflow and subsequent energization of O<SUP>+</SUP> ions in the wave fields into the inner magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "In October 2014, the close encounter between Mars and comet Siding Spring produced a transient ionized layer in the upper atmosphere composed primarily of Mg<SUP>+</SUP> and Fe<SUP>+</SUP> ions. The layer was detected by instruments on three spacecraft, including the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on Mars Express. Analyses of the MARSIS data indicated the transient layer persisted up to 19 h after the comet's closest approach. We report MARSIS observations that suggest the transient layer lasted at least 7 days—and potentially as long as 32 days—after closest approach. During this period, the transient layer was mostly confined to a narrow latitude range between 20°N and 60°N and a longitude range spanning 275°E to 95°E. Since this period coincided with a highly active Sun, we discuss how solar flares may have contributed to the layer's prolonged lifetime.",

  "abstract": "Impacts of solar flare vary at different parts of the lower ionosphere depending on it's proximity to the direct exposure of incoming solar radiation. The quantitative analysis of this phenomena can be attributed to `solar zenith angle (χ (t ))' profile over ionosphere. We numerically solve the `electron continuity equation' to obtain the lower ionospheric electron density profile (N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )). The electron production rate (q (t )) is governed by the (i) X-ray profile (ϕ (t )) of the flare, (ii) χ (t )-values during the flare occurrence etc. For analyzing the X-ray profile during flares, we use the GOES-15 satellite observations. Since we're working on electron continuity equation based simplified ionospheric model, we confined our analysis for comparatively stable mid-latitude ionosphere only. We choose three flares each from C, M and X-classes for N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile computation. We observe that temporal N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profiles differ when computed for lower ionosphere over different discrete latitudes. Further, we compute the spatial N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile across mid-latitude at the time when ϕ (t )=ϕ<SUB>m a x</SUB>. Now we assume that, these flares repeat themselves every day of a year (D o Y ) at the same time of a day and we compute N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profiles for each day. We found a seasonal effect on N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile due to solar flare. Further, we investigate the response time delay (Δ t ) of the lower ionosphere, which is the time difference between incidence of X-ray and the respective change in N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profiles during solar flares. Strong seasonal effects on N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile and Δ t are the unique results of this work.",

  "abstract": "The vertical coupling between the cloud-level atmosphere and the thermosphere of Venus was investigated using 365 nm images obtained by the Ultraviolet Imager on board Akatsuki and oxygen atom 135.6 nm dayglow intensities obtained by the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectroscope for Exospheric Dynamics on board the space telescope Hisaki. Simultaneous observations revealed a common periodicity of ~3.6 Earth days in the cloud-tracked velocity, the cloud brightness, and the airglow intensity. The oscillation at the cloud level is attributed to a planetary-scale Kelvin wave. A one-dimensional linear wave model showed that the Kelvin wave cannot propagate from the cloud level to the thermosphere because of radiative damping. The modeling also revealed that a small-scale gravity waves having wavelengths of &lt;1,000 km can reach the thermosphere on the dawnside and that they are strongly attenuated on the duskside because of the difference in the background winds with vertical shears. We further developed a one-dimensional photochemical model to investigate the response of the airglow intensity to the change of the eddy diffusion coefficient, which is expected to increase with the wave amplitude. The model showed that a 3.6-day oscillation of the diffusion coefficient with an amplitude of ~300 m<SUP>2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> explains the observed airglow intensity variation. A possible cause of the 3.6-day period is the filtering of gravity wave fluxes by the Kelvin wave-induced wind.",

  "abstract": "The geologic histories of planetary surfaces reveal that Earth and Mars have been pummeled by cataclysmic impact events. The surface of Mars has been perused to have an impact origin for its hemispheric dichotomy. The spallation during impact events causes the interplanetary transfer of material from Mars to Earth or Mars to Phobos/Deimos. Assessing the survival of micro-organisms in impact conditions is critical for the development of planetary protection strategies for future missions. Shock waves are generated during such major impact events. The objective of the present investigation was to explore the microbial diversity of the hypersaline sulphated Laguna de Peña Hueca, Spain and to study the effect of shock waves on extremophilic bacteria isolated from the lake. Peña Hueca is a hypersaline sulphated lagoon rich in Mg-Na-SO<SUB>4</SUB>-Cl, epsomite and hexahydrate and it potentially serves as Planetary field analogue site for Martian chloride deposits and salt-rich subsurface brines of Ocean worlds like Enceladus and Europa. The microbial community structure of the lagoon was studied by 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing. The phylogenetic studies indicated the presence of phyla Euryarchaeota, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroides in the hypersaline brines of the lagoon. The anoxic sediments of Peña Hueca showed the presence of Haloanaerobiaeta and Hadesarchaeota including the anoxic genus of Haloanaerobium, Desulfosalsimonas and Desulfovermiculum. The effect of impact shock on the halophilic bacterium Halomonas gomseomensis EP-3 isolated from Laguna de Peña Hueca was studied in a Reddy shock tube. The halophilic bacterium was exposed to shock waves at a peak shock pressure of 300 kPa and a temperature of 400 K. The results of shock recovery experiments of halophilic bacteria reveal 97% killing at 300 kPa and Mach number of 1.47 in comparison with Bacillus sp. This study indicates that gram-positive spore-forming Bacillus sp. are better adapted to survival in impact shock waves in comparison to non-sporulating halophiles. In the current study, we present the first report on response of halophiles in impact shock. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application of the simple handheld Reddy shock tube in astrobiology. The survival studies of halophiles isolated from terrestrial analogue sites in impact shock can provide valuable insights in astrobiology and microbial physiology in impact shock stress.",

  "abstract": "A clear understanding of storm-time magnetospheric dynamics is essential for a reliable storm forecasting capability. The dayside magnetospheric response to an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME; dynamic pressure P<SUB>dyn</SUB> &gt; 20 nPa and storm-time index SYM-H &lt; -150 nT) is investigated using in situ OMNI, Geotail, Cluster, MMS, GOES, Van Allen Probes, and THEMIS measurements. The dayside magnetic flux content is directly quantified from in situ magnetic field measurements at different radial distances. The arrival of the ICME, consisting of shock and sheath regions preceding a magnetic cloud, initiated a storm sudden commencement (SSC) phase (SYM-H ~ +50 nT). At SSC, the magnetopause standoff distance was compressed earthward at ICME shock encounter at an average rate ~-10.8 Earth radii per hour for ~10 min, resulting in a rapid 40% reduction in the magnetospheric volume. The \"closed\" magnetic flux content remained constant at 170 ± 30 kWb inside the compressed dayside magnetosphere, even in the presence of dayside reconnection, as evident by an outsized flux transfer event containing 160 MWb. During the storm main and recovery phases, the magnetosphere expanded. The dayside magnetic flux did not remain constant within the expanding magnetosphere (110 ± 30 kWb), resulting in a 35% reduction in pre-storm flux content during the magnetic cloud encounter. At that stage, the magnetospheric magnetic flux was eroded resulting in a weakened dayside magnetospheric field strength at radial distances R ≥ 5 R<SUB>E</SUB>. It is concluded that the inadequate replenishment of the eroded dayside magnetospheric flux during the magnetosphere expansion phase is due to a time lag in storm-time Dungey cycle.",

  "abstract": "We propose the system design of a small orbiter of the Jovian moon Europa (Europa Tomography Probe, ETP in short) aimed at unveiling its interior structure. ETP is conceived as a piggyback probe of a larger spacecraft to the Jovian system (such as Europa Clipper). Its payload comprises only a magnetometer and transponder. The former will be used to measure the time-varying, induction magnetic field of the moon at different orbital and rotational frequencies, a measurement inaccessible to a flyby spacecraft. An Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) between ETP and the main spacecraft, enabled by the on-board transponder, will be used to accurately determine Europa's gravity field, rotational state and tidal deformation. By combining magnetic and gravity field measurements, ETP could characterize the interior structure of Europa with an accuracy only attainable by a low-altitude orbiter, thus constraining the thickness and conductivity of the subsurface ocean. Following the announcement that a 250-300-kg mass allowance was available on the upcoming NASA Europa Clipper spacecraft, we propose ETP's mission and spacecraft design assuming Clipper's nominal trajectory as a baseline. The concept can be adapted to a class of missions to the Jovian and Saturnian systems based upon a mother-daughter spacecraft system. The spacecraft design has been pursued under the philosophy of determining the minimum required total mass and volume that allows to meet the scientific requirements, rather than finding out what science return could be obtained with pre-assigned system constraints. Since ETP shall autonomously reach its final orbit, the propulsion system has been one of the primary focuses. The radiation analysis has also been essential because the shielding structure affects both the mission duration and the mass budget. We show that the ETP concept could be, indeed, technically feasible with an overall system mass budget just above 250 kg, thus providing a valuable yet affordable augmentation to a larger flyby mission to Europa.",

Their sizes have been clarified. Their shapes were approximated by triaxial ellipsoids. But measurement errors of the axes differences a - c , a - b have exceeded their values. So the asphericity of the figures was not revealed. The same concerns the asphericity of the gravitational fields of Pluto and Charon. So measurements during future space missions must be more accurate.

  "abstract": "Magnetosheath jets are localized fast flows with enhanced dynamic pressure. When they supermagnetosonically compress the ambient magnetosheath plasma, a bow wave or shock can form ahead of them. Such a bow wave was recently observed to accelerate ions and possibly electrons. The ion acceleration process was previously analyzed, but the electron acceleration process remains largely unexplored. Here we use multipoint observations by Time History of Events and Macroscale during Substorms from three events to determine whether and how magnetosheath jet-driven bow waves can accelerate electrons. We show that when suprathermal electrons in the ambient magnetosheath convect toward a bow wave, some electrons are shock-drift accelerated and reflected toward the ambient magnetosheath and others continue moving downstream of the bow wave resulting in bidirectional motion. Our study indicates that magnetosheath jet-driven bow waves can result in additional energization of suprathermal electrons in the magnetosheath. It implies that magnetosheath jets can increase the efficiency of electron acceleration at planetary bow shocks or other similar astrophysical environments.",

We examined the intrinsic variability in neutron die-away data using simulated DAN measurements with a range of compositions relevant to equatorial and high-latitude environments on Mars. Our analysis shows that the total neutron counts and timing of neutron arrival explain most variability in thermal neutron die-away curves for a DAN-like instrument configuration over homogeneous subsurfaces. We analyzed the variability in thermal neutron die-away across a variety of elemental compositions that might be observed by DAN or future instruments. We found that when H concentration is low (e.g., in equatorial regions including Gale crater), neutron die-away is most sensitive to variations in H. Conversely, when H concentration is high (e.g., in poleward regions of Mars or icy bodies), neutron die-away is most sensitive to variations in neutron absorbers. We estimated that the H and neutron absorber concentrations in DAN measurements acquired Sols 1-2080 in Gale crater and found that most measurements had low H and moderate absorber content. We presented an outlier analysis of these measurements to identify targets with high potential scientific impact and found that most outliers along the traverse corresponded with abnormally low or high neutron absorber content measurements, some of which may be associated with high-silica fracture-associated halos and felsic igneous material.",

The typical flapping period in Mercury's magnetotail is much shorter (~13 s), comparing with ~10-20 min at Earth's magnetotail. The magnetic field oscillation amplitude induced by flapping motion is larger near both flanks than that around tail center. Similar to Earth's magnetotail, there are two flapping types existent in Mercury's magnetotail, one is the kink-like flapping that can propagate as traveling waves, and the other one is the steady flapping that does not propagate. Both flapping types distribute widely in magnetotail. The kink-like flapping waves propagating either dawnward or duskward can be observed across the entire magnetotail current sheet, which suggests that the energy sources for triggering the kink-like flapping waves should locate around both tail flanks instead of tail center as is for the Earth's magnetotail.",

  "abstract": "As more missions to Mars require greater autonomy of both rovers and humans, more sophisticated computer technology in close proximity will be necessary to sustain operations. On Earth, cloud technology has provided significant cost-saving benefits to companies that require heavy compute resources due to the pay-per-use pricing model. The same could be true on Mars, assuming that there is enough demand for high-capacity, on-demand compute and data storage resources. The concept of a compute cloud about Mars (\"Dust Storm\") was developed to determine a basic pricing model for compute, and other Platform as a Service (PaaS) features. Existing mission concepts were re-evaluated under the assumption of using Dust Storm versus developing and deploying an in-house solution. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to control for inaccurate assumptions and estimates. It was determined that five-year multi-agent missions would cost significantly less (48.6%) when renting time from Dust Storm. It was also determined that the greatest effects on cost savings are the cost of building and deploying Dust Storm, the maximum data transfer rate between Earth and Mars, and the length of time expected to recoup initial investments. Future research will be required to reduce hardware costs, and increase data transfer rates.",

  "abstract": "Understanding the energization processes and constituent composition of the plasma and energetic particles injected into the near-Earth region from the tail is an important component of understanding magnetospheric dynamics. In this study, we present multiple case studies of the high-energy (≳40 keV) suprathermal ion populations during energetic particle enhancement events observed by the Energetic Ion Spectrometer (EIS) on NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission in the magnetotail. We present results from correlation analysis of the flux response between different energy channels of different ion species (hydrogen, helium, and oxygen) for multiple cases. We demonstrate that this technique can be used to infer the dominant charge state of the heavy ions, despite the fact that charge is not directly measured by EIS. Using this technique, we find that the energization and dispersion of suprathermal ions during energetic particle enhancements concurrent with (or near) fast plasma flows are ordered by energy per charge state (E/q) throughout the magnetotail regions examined (~7 to 25 Earth radii). The ions with the highest energies (≳300 keV) are helium and oxygen of solar wind origin, which obtain their greater energization due to their higher charge states. Additionally, the case studies show that during these injections the flux ratio of enhancement is also well ordered by E/q. These results expand on previous results which showed that high-energy total ion measurements in the magnetosphere are dominated by high-charge-state heavy ions and that protons are often not the dominant species above ~300 keV.",

  "abstract": "Pseudosubstorms (pseudobreakups) and substorms are similar phenomena. In terms of auroral morphology, however, the former are not accompanied by poleward expansion, while the latter are. To understand what causes this difference, we studied temporal and spatial development of the near-Earth magnetotail at X=-7 to -11RE around pseudosubstorm and substorm onsets, based on superposed epoch analysis of Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) data. We find that the earthward flow begins to increase at X=-10 to -11RE just before onset and dipolarization for both pseudosubstorms and substorms, possibly due to near-Earth magnetic reconnection or the preceding relaxation of the thin current sheet in a tailward region, but the earthward flow is slower for pseudosubstorms than for substorms. Dipolarization, together with magnetic field fluctuation, is nearly the same at X=-8RE for both cases, but it is weaker at other distances for pseudosubstorms than for substorms. This result suggests that the current disruption related to dipolarization does not expand tailward and hence auroral poleward expansion does not occur for pseudosubstorms. Furthermore, the total pressure is larger at X=-8 to -11RE for several minutes before onset for substorms than for pseudosubstorms. The total pressure gradient increases more largely after onset for substorms than for pseudosubstorms. We suggest that these differences are important factors for determining whether ballooning instability causing current disruption grows in a wide area, that is, whether the initial action develops into a substorm or subsides as a pseudosubstorm.",

  "abstract": "Similar to Earth, Mercury's magnetotail experiences frequent dipolarization of the magnetic field. These rapid (~2 s) increases in the northward component of the tail field (ΔB<SUB>z</SUB> ~ 30 nT) at Mercury are associated with fast sunward flows (~200 km/s) that enhance local magnetic field convection. Differences between the two magnetospheres, namely Mercury's smaller spatiotemporal scales and lack of an ionosphere, influence the dynamics of dipolarizations in these magnetotails. At Earth, the braking of fast dipolarization flows near the inner magnetosphere accumulates magnetic flux and develops the substorm current wedge. At Mercury, flow braking and flux pileup remain open topics. In this work, we develop an automated algorithm to identify dipolarizations, which allows for statistical examination of flow braking and flux pileup in Mercury's magnetotail. We find that near the inner edge of the plasma sheet, steep magnetic pressure gradients cause substantial braking of fast dipolarization flows. The dipolarization frequency and sunward flow speed decrease significantly within a region ~500 km thick located at ~900 km altitude above Mercury's local midnight surface. Due to the close proximity of the braking region to the planet, we estimate that ~10-20% of dipolarizations may reach the nightside surface of the planet. The remaining dipolarizations exhibit prolonged statistical flux pileup within the braking region similar to large-scale dipolarization of Earth's inner magnetosphere. The existence of flow braking and flux pileup at Mercury indicates that a current wedge may form, although the limitations imposed by Mercury's magnetosphere require the braking of multiple, continuous dipolarizations for current wedge formation.",

  "abstract": "The mid- and low-latitude ionosphere is home to a variety of plasma density irregularities, including depletions (bubbles), enhancements (blobs), and small-scale scintillation. Previous studies of plasma density enhancements observed using ROCSAT data have posited that these structures are the direct result of the formation of bubbles near the geomagnetic equator. However, more recent observations from the C/NOFS satellite suggest that multiple mechanisms are responsible for forming plasma enhancements, with wave action in the ionosphere and thermosphere as a significant driver of the enhanced densities. Indeed, statistical analysis of enhancements observed from satellites resembles the statistics of Medium-Scale Traveling Ionosphere Disturbances (MSTIDs) with respect to seasonal variability and solar activity. <P />petitSat is a CubeSat mission designed to examine the link between MSTIDs and plasma enhancements. The mission will provide in situ measurements of the plasma density, 3D ion drift, as well as ion and neutral composition. The instrument suite includes a combined retarding potential analyzer and cross-track drift meter and an ion-neutral mass spectrometer. This instrument suite will provide comprehensive information about the fluctuations in plasma, as well as changes in the neutral profile. petitSat will launch into a 51 deg inclination orbit at 400 km (consistent with an International Space Station deployment), allowing for numerous conjunctions with the Boston University All-Sky Imager network over the mission lifetime.",

  "abstract": "Ganymede is the only Solar System moon known to generate a permanent magnetic field. Jovian plasma motions around Ganymede create an upstream magnetopause, where energy flows are thought to be driven by magnetic reconnection. Simulations indicate Ganymedean reconnection events may be transient, but the nature of magnetopause reconnection at Ganymede remains poorly understood, requiring an assessment of reconnection onset theory. We present an analytical model of steady-state conditions at Ganymede's magnetopause, from which the first Ganymedean reconnection onset assessment is conducted. We find that reconnection may occur wherever Ganymede's closed magnetic field encounters Jupiter's ambient magnetic field, regardless of variations in magnetopause conditions. Unrestricted reconnection onset highlights possibilities for multiple X lines or widespread transient reconnection at Ganymede. The reconnection rate is controlled by the ambient Jovian field orientation and hence driven by Jupiter's rotation. Future progress on this topic is highly relevant for the JUpiter ICy moon Explorer mission.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, currents causing the sudden commencement (SC), the AU/AL indices, and the positive bay during the substorm are identified from the global simulation and Biot-Savart's law. Candidate currents assumed as causes of these ground magnetic variations are the ionospheric Hall current, the ionospheric Pedersen current, the field-aligned current (FAC), and other magnetospheric currents than the FAC. In general, FAC effect and Pedersen current effect cancel out each other under the restriction of Fukushima's theorem. During the SC, for instance, the midlatitude preliminary positive impulse appears in the prenoon and midlatitude preliminary reverse impulse (PRI) appears in the postnoon, due to the remaining effect of the Hall current. However, violations of the Fukushima's theorem are also common such as in the cases of the equatorial PRI, the auroral electrojet, and the positive bay. The equatorial PRI caused by the Pedersen current appears both in the prenoon and postnoon regions. In the auroral region, the Hall current effect prevails over other currents so much and determines the AU/AL indices only from it regardless other currents. The midlatitude positive bay on the nightside is generated by the effect of the FAC. From these diverse reproduction of ground magnetic variations, a further verification is given for the global simulation in reproductions of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process.",

Bedrock in the Murray formation has an interquartile range of 2.3-3.1 wt.% H<SUB>2</SUB>O, similar to measurements using the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons and Sample Analysis at Mars instruments.

One stratigraphic interval with higher hydrogen is the Sutton Island unit and Blunts Point unit contact, where higher hydrogen is associated with Fe-rich, Ca-rich, and Mg-rich points. A second interval with higher hydrogen occurs in the Vera Rubin ridge portion of the Murray formation, where higher hydrogen is associated with Fe-rich, Ca-rich, and Si-rich points. We also observe trends in the H signal with grain size, separate from chemical variation, whereby coarser-grained rocks have higher hydrogen. Variability in the hydrogen content of rocks points to a history of water-rock interaction at Gale crater that included changes in lake water chemistry during Murray formation deposition and multiple subsequent groundwater episodes.",

  "abstract": "The plasmasphere is a critical region of the magnetosphere. It is important for the evolution of Earth's radiation belts. Waves in the plasmasphere interior (hiss) and vicinity (electromagnetic ion cyclotron, chorus) help control the acceleration and loss of radiation belt particles. Thus, understanding the extent, structure, content, and dynamics of the plasmasphere is crucial to understanding radiation belt losses. The Van Allen Probes mission uses two methods to determine the total plasma density. First, the upper hybrid resonance frequency can provide electron density; this determination is the most accurate and robust. However, it requires significant analysis and is challenging during geomagnetically active times: It becomes difficult to interpret the wave spectrum, and the amount of available data is severely limited. Second, the spacecraft potential is a proxy for the plasma density. These high-resolution measurements are available with high duty cycle. However, environmental effects can limit the accuracy of this method. The relation between spacecraft potential and density is empirical, requiring an independent density measurement and repeated checks. We perform a quantitative comparison of these two in situ techniques during the first 3.5 years of the Van Allen Probes mission. We show how to calibrate potential-based density measurements using only publicly available wave-derived densities to provide high-fidelity results even if upper hybrid measurements are sparse or unavailable. We quantify the level of uncertainty to expect from potential-derived density data. Our approach can be applied to any in situ spacecraft mission where reliable absolute density and spacecraft potential data are available.",

Accelerated electrons are observed at energies up to 400 eV at the times when MARSIS transmits at a frequency between the local plasma frequency and its harmonics (up to 4 times the plasma frequency). When the electron density and magnetic field strength are low (∼103 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, ∼ 10 nT), the accelerated electrons are almost monoenergetic electron beams. An increase in density and magnetic field (∼3·103 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, ∼ 50 nT) leads to substantial broadening of the energy spectrum of the accelerated electrons. It is concluded that in the latter case, electrons are accelerated by the variable spacecraft potential resulting from the imbalance of the electron and ion currents to the MARSIS antenna during transmission.",

  "abstract": "The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft successfully orbited Mars for over nine Earth years, its instruments returning a plethora of data that still today form important, key data sets in Mars research. A relatively underutilized data set was returned from the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), specifically the wide-angle component (MOC-WA), despite returning over 150,000 images in \"blue\" and \"red\" wavelengths. The median imaging time of day was 14:00, resulting in few shadows, making it difficult to use for geology, while better cameras arrived within a few years. However, the limb-to-limb coverage of the MOC-WA survey images provides an important resource, where the imaging time that was poor for geology is good for measuring reflectivity. To-date, the only published albedo maps of Mars are from a companion MGS instrument, TES, with wide wavelength coverage and low spatial resolution, and the OMEGA instrument on Mars Express. Modern processing of the MOC-WA images, presented here, allow for the creation of new reflectivity maps in a narrow wavelength range that can be used for photometric control of other data sets and understanding broad-scale surface changes on Mars. Four reflectivity maps were made, at cardinal L<SUB>s</SUB> points, averaging images taken within just a week of each L<SUB>s</SUB> but across multiple Mars years. From these maps, several trends are revealed though most have been previously described, including significant differences in seasonal frost cover surrounding each residual polar ice cap, and significant changes across Syrtis Major, Solis Lacus, and the Tharsis volcanoes.",

  "abstract": "Collisionless shocks are one of the most effective particle accelerators in the known universe. Even low Mach number shocks could have a significant role in particle heating and acceleration. Theory suggests that kinematic collisionless relaxation, the process whereby a downstream nongyroptopic ion population becomes thermalized through collisionless gyrophase mixing, is the dominant energy redistribution mechanism in quasi-perpendicular, low Mach number, and low β shocks. However, there have only been a limited number of observations of these shocks using in situ measurements at Venus, Earth and in interplanetary space. This paper presents the results of the first detailed study using in situ measurements, of the effect of fundamental parameters on the formation of these shocks. All low Mach number shocks occurring during the magnetic cloud phase of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection are identified in Venus Express magnetic field data over the duration of the mission. From the 92 shock crossings identified, 38 show clear evidence of kinematic relaxation. It is shown that kinematic relaxation is dominant at Venus when the angle between the local shock normal and upstream magnetic field is greater 50° and the Alfvén Mach number is less than 1.4. These shocks are also observed across a range of solar-zenith-angles indicating that it is likely that any location on the Venus bow shock could form such a structure. Venus Express plasma measurements are used to verify the parameters estimated from the magnetic field and indicate the importance of heavy ions, including potential pickup O<SUP>+</SUP>.",

  "abstract": "A stable auroral red (SAR) arc is an aurora with a dominant 630 nm emission at subauroral latitudes. SAR arcs have been considered to occur due to the spatial overlap between the plasmasphere and the ring-current ions. In the overlap region, plasmaspheric electrons are heated by ring-current ions or plasma waves, and their energy is then transferred down to the ionosphere where it causes oxygen red emission. However, there have been no study conducted so far that quantitatively examined plasma and electromagnetic fields in the magnetosphere associated with SAR arc. In this paper, we report the first quantitative evaluation of conjugate measurements of a SAR arc observed at 2204 UT on 28 March 2017 and investigate its source region using an all-sky imager at Nyrölä (magnetic latitude: 59.4°N), Finland, and the Arase satellite. The Arase observation shows that the SAR arc appeared in the overlap region between a plasmaspheric plume and the ring-current ions and that electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves and kinetic Alfven waves were not observed above the SAR arc. The SAR arc was located at the ionospheric trough minimum identified from a total electron content map obtained by the GNSS receiver network. The Swarm satellite flying in the ionosphere also passed the SAR arc at ~2320 UT and observed a decrease in electron density and an increase in electron temperature during the SAR-arc crossing. These observations suggest that the heating of plasmaspheric electrons via Coulomb collision with ring-current ions is the most plausible mechanism for the SAR-arc generation.",

  "abstract": "We present a new method for determining the total electron content (TEC) in the Martian ionosphere based on the time delay of received radar pulses of the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) on board the Mars Express spacecraft. Previous studies of the same dataset have produced differing results for the day-side ionosphere, so it is useful to have an alternative way to compute the TEC in this region. This method iterates a model ionosphere in order to simultaneously match the ionospheric delays of the signals received by the radar's two channels by finding the model which minimizes the root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured and simulated delays. Topographical information is obtained from data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument. The model parameters are held constant for a given orbit, and a very good agreement between the simulated and measured delays is obtained. The TEC can then be inverted from the ionospheric model. Matching the delays of both channels simultaneously applies an additional constraint to the model which has not been made in previous studies. The model is additionally validated by matching the simulated pulses with the raw range-compressed measurements for one orbit. Finally, typical model parameters are compared to those obtained by previous studies, which are also simulated. The method is applied to orbits during moderate solar activity, and results show very good agreement with previous studies.",

The particle gyrocenters lie earthward from the spacecraft, indicating that the maximum ion fluxes come from close to the magnetosphere. We provide important evidence that argues against an explanation of the particle source in terms of hot flow anomaly acceleration. A three-dimensional global hybrid simulation shows that escaping magnetospheric ions can be scattered and transported across the magnetosheath. Ground magnetometer observations suggest that a solar wind pressure increase accelerates escaping magnetospheric ions via betatron acceleration, resulting in an inverse energy dispersion in the magnetosheath. However, there are no pressure changes detected on the MMS and ACE spacecraft and the ground magnetic field strength does not appear to be large enough to be consistent with the large magnetospheric compression needed to account for a betatron acceleration. Therefore, we suggest that the inverse energy dispersion event can be explained by a magnetic field rotation that connects MMS to the subsolar magnetosphere, enabling high-energy particles from deep within the inner magnetosphere gain access to the magnetopause and magnetosheath.",

  "abstract": "Understanding magmatic processes is critical to understanding Mars as a system, but Curiosity's investigation of dominantly sedimentary rocks has made it difficult to constrain igneous processes. Igneous classification of float rocks is challenging because of the following: (1) the possibility that they have been affected by sedimentary processes or weathering, and (2) grain size heterogeneity in the observed rock textures makes the small-scale compositions measured by rover instruments unreliable for bulk classification. We avoid these ambiguities by using detrital igneous mineral chemistry to constrain models of magmatic processes in the source region for the fluvio-deltaic Bradbury group. Mineral chemistry is obtained from X-ray diffraction of three collected samples and a new stoichiometric and visual filtering of ~5,000 laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spots to identify compositions of individual igneous minerals. Observed mineral chemistries are compared to those produced by MELTS thermodynamic modeling to constrain possible magmatic conditions. Fractionation of two starting primary melts derived from different extent of adiabatic decompression melting of a primitive mantle composition could result in the crystallization of all minerals observed. Crystal fractionation of a subalkaline and an alkaline magma is required to form the observed minerals. These results are consistent with the collection of alkaline and subalkaline rocks from Gale as well as clasts from the Martian meteorite Northwest Africa 7034 and paired stones. This new method for constraining magmatic processes will be of significant interest for the Mars 2020 mission, which will also investigate an ancient volcaniclastic-sedimentary environment and will include a LIBS instrument.",

  "abstract": "The daytime ionospheric E region hosts a vortex of horizontal equivalent currents driven by the wind dynamo in each hemisphere: the solar quiet current system. Differences in the dynamo actions at conjugate points in the two hemispheres drive interhemispheric currents (interhemispheric field-aligned currents [IHFACs]). Despite the long history of investigations on this topic, only a few studies have reported a latitude dependence of the IHFACs. In this study we make use of the magnetic field observations from the European Space Agency's Swarm constellation to address the latitude dependence of IHFACs in depth. At low latitudes (&lt;35° magnetic latitude), the statistics generally agree with previous findings from other satellite missions. However, the polarity of currents changes at magnetic latitude of about ±35°. The magnetic latitude dependence of IHFACs can be reproduced by the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model, when the lower boundary of the model (~30 km) is properly constrained with meteorological reanalysis data. As for the seasonal variations, the midlatitude (&gt;35° magnetic latitude) IHFAC climatology during equinoxes is generally similar to that of June solstice while that of December solstice exhibits stand-alone behavior.",

  "abstract": "A reliable interpretation of solar eclipse effects on the geospace environment, and on the ionosphere in particular, necessitates a careful consideration of the so-called eclipse geometry. A solar eclipse is a relatively rare astronomical phenomenon, which geometry is rather complex, specific for each event, and fast changing in time. The standard, most popular way to look at the eclipse geometry is via the two-dimensional representation (map) of the solar obscuration on the Earth's surface, in which the path of eclipse totality is drawn together with isolines of the gradually-decreasing eclipse magnitude farther away from this path. Such \"surface maps\" are widely used to readily explain some of the solar eclipse effects including, for example, the well-known decrease in total ionization (due to the substantial decrease in solar irradiation), usually presented by the popular and easy to understand ionospheric characteristic of total electron content (TEC). However, many other effects, especially those taking place at higher altitudes, cannot be explained in this fashion. Instead, a more detailed description of the umbra (and penumbra), would be required. This paper addresses the issue of eclipse geometry effects on various ionospheric observations carried out during the total solar eclipse of 21 August 2017. In particular, GPS-based TEC measurements were analyzed and eclipse effects on the ionosphere are interpreted with respect to the actual eclipse geometry at ionospheric heights. Whenever possible, a comparison was made with results from other eclipse events.",

  "abstract": "Most of the organics detected on Mars so far are aliphatic and aromatic organo-chlorine compounds. The smallest were first identified by the thermal treatment of the solid samples by Viking in 1976; although at the time, they were attributed to contamination. Since 2012, a larger variety of structures have been identified by the Sample Analysis at Mars experiment aboard the Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the chlorohydrocarbons formed during pyrolysis of sedimentary materials. Laboratory experiments show that heating of samples containing oxychlorines, such as chlorates (ClO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>) and perchlorates (ClO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>), along with organic matter present at Mars' surface is the logical source of these compounds. Nevertheless, this discovery of indigenous organic matter in the Mars regolith raises important questions: How do the oxychlorines influence the pyrolysis of organics? What are the organics precursors of the organo-chlorinated molecules detected on Mars? Is there a way to identify the parent molecules in a sample after pyrolysis? This paper presents the results of systematic laboratory experiments of the products formed during the pyrolysis of organic compounds from three chemical families—polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, amino acids, and carboxylic acids—in presence of calcium perchlorates. Results show that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon parent molecules and most of the carboxylic acids are still detectable after pyrolysis in presence of calcium perchlorate and that the degradation and/or evolution of all parent molecules mostly depends on their chemical nature. In addition, we demonstrate that the chlorohydrocarbons detected on Mars by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument could come from the three chemical families studied.",

  "abstract": "In this work, a direct force control numerical predictor-corrector guidance architecture is developed to enable Neptune aerocapture using blunt body aeroshells. A linear aerodynamics model is formulated for a Mars Science Laboratory-derived aeroshell. The application of optimal control theory shows that the ΔV-minimizing angle of attack and side-slip angle control laws are bang-bang. A closed-loop numerical predictor-corrector direct force control guidance algorithm is developed and numerically simulated using the Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories II. A series of Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to assess the guidance robustness to uncertainties in vehicle aerodynamics, atmospheric density, and entry state. For the reference set of uncertainties, the direct force control vehicle achieves 99.7% successful science orbit insertion within a 330 m/s total ΔV budget for periapsis raise, apoapsis, inclination, and ascending node corrections. Improved atmospheric knowledge and delivery state accuracy are shown to improve the success to 100% and reduce the ΔV to 230 m/s. Direct force control is demonstrated to be an enabling technology for blunt body aerocapture at Neptune while providing comparable performance to existing slender body vehicles studied in literature.",

  "abstract": "A major debate in Mars science is the nature of the early Mars climate, and the availability of precipitation and runoff. Observations of relict erosional valley networks have been proposed as evidence for extensive surface runoff around the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. However, these valley networks only provide a time-integrated record of landscape evolution, and thus, the timing, relative timescales and intensity of aqueous activity required to erode the valleys remain unknown. Here, we investigate an ancient fluvial sedimentary system in western Arabia Terra, now preserved in positive relief. This ridge, \"Aram Dorsum,\" is flat-topped, branching, ~85 km long, and particularly well preserved. We show that Aram Dorsum was an aggradational alluvial system and that the existing ridge was once a large river channel belt set in extensive flood plains, many of which are still preserved. Smaller, palaeochannel belts feed the main system; their setting and network pattern suggest a distributed source of water. The alluvial succession is up to 60 m thick, suggesting a formation time of 10<SUP>5</SUP> to 10<SUP>7</SUP> years by analogy to Earth. Our observations are consistent with Aram Dorsum having formed by long-lived flows of water, sourced both locally, and regionally as part of a wider alluvial system in Arabia Terra. This suggests frequent or seasonal precipitation as the source of water. Correlating our observations with previous regional-scale mapping shows that Aram Dorsum formed in the mid-Noachian. Aram Dorsum is one of the oldest fluvial systems described on Mars and indicates climatic conditions that sustained surface river flows on early Mars.",

Polar wind circulations are instrumental in shaping the NPLD. In particular, the downslope (katabatic) flows help carve the spiral-shaped geological depressions, known as the polar troughs, and appropriate environmental conditions develop katabatic jumps that favor substantial water abundance changes over the troughs. Utilizing CRISM retrievals, we report the first observational evidence of the sharp increase in the water vapor abundance over polar troughs on Mars at high resolution (~320 m). This has a direct influence on the dynamic evolution of ice migration in the northern polar cap, the major source of atmospheric water on Mars.",

  "abstract": "Policy makers need reliable future climate projection for adaptation purposes. A clear separation of sources of uncertainty also helps narrow the projection uncertainty. However, it remains unclear for monsoon precipitation projections. Here we quantified the contributions of internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty to the ensemble spread of global land monsoon precipitation projections using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). For mean precipitation, model uncertainty (contributing ~90%) dominates the projection uncertainty, while the contribution of internal variability (scenario uncertainty) decreases (increases) with time. The source of uncertainty for extreme precipitation differs from that of mean precipitation mainly in long-term projection, with the contribution of scenario uncertainty comparable to model uncertainty. Reducing model uncertainty can effectively narrow the monsoon precipitation projection. The internal variability estimates differ slightly among models and methods, the uncertainty partitioning is robust in middle-long term.",

  "abstract": "Aeolian processes are the dominant geological activity on Mars under current environmental conditions, and decoding the surface features on Mars is important for determining its history. Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs) on Mars are mysterious aeolian features originally considered to be unique to Mars. The origin, formation process and sediment sources for TARs remain uncertain, but using high-resolution satellite images and studying terrestrial analogs are important tools for examining these features. TAR-like features in the Lut desert of Iran are excellent analogs for exploring the diversity and dimensions of TAR-like features, in order to shed light on the most likely origin of TARs on Mars. We used a semi-automatic mapping methodology to document TAR-like bedforms in the Lut desert. Morphometry of more than 2 million TAR-like features in the Lut study area were automatically extracted for this study, along with manual measurements of ~2000 features using photoclinometry in order to document heights. High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) digital terrain models (DTMs) were used to obtain measurements for ~2000 Martian TARs, in order to compare similar data sets for the morphometry of both Martian TARs and the Lut analogs. We analyzed measured physical attributes in order to explore physical conditions that may have contributed to their formation. A multi-temporal analysis of the Lut TAR-like features used satellite images spanning an 8-year time period. Four groups of TAR-like features in the Lut Desert were identified by their morphometry and their response to wind conditions.",

Here we examine pressure anisotropic ballooning instabilities in stretched magnetotail geometries. Our results show that transition from an initially perpendicular anisotropy toward parallel anisotropy reduces the plasma β threshold for triggering a ballooning instability. Such increasingly parallel anisotropies can form as a direct consequence of tail stretching that occurs during the late substorm growth phase through the well-known effects of drift shell splitting and the competition between betatron and Fermi processes in the tail. We propose such increasingly parallel ballooning triggers auroral substorm onset on field lines in the transition region between dipolar and tail-like fields, consistent with observational constraints on the location of the onset arc with respect to the ion isotropy boundary in the magnetotail.",

  "abstract": "A study of the correlation length of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves around Venus was developed using electron density and magnetic field data obtained from the Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA-4) and magnetometer (MAG), respectively, on board of the mission Venus Express (VEX). The analysis was conducted using the whole interval of the mission (2006-2014). The correlation scales have been calculated by the correlation length parameter that is a characteristic distance over which fluctuations in a variable are correlated. We limited the study to the frequency range from 8 to 50 mHz because previous studies have shown that ULF waves produced in the foreshock have the highest power in this range. In this study the correlation length was calculated by an exponential fit employed to the auto-correlation curve. The auto-correlation function was calculated lagged by a time between 0 and 60 s and sliding a window with 120s across the data. This analysis has been also extended to correlation length determinations in spatial scale. In order to obtain the correlation length in a spatial domain, the temporal correlation length must be multiplied by the solar wind velocity. Here, the ASPERA-4/IMA (Ion Mass Analyzer) velocity data was used. It was found that the dominant correlation length in temporal scale varies from 9 to 14 s in electron density and between 7.5 and 11 s in the magnetic field. In spatial scale, correlation length varies between 2.8 ×10<SUP>3</SUP> and 5 ×10<SUP>3</SUP> km in electron density data, and between 1.7 ×10<SUP>3</SUP> - 4 X10<SUP>3</SUP> km for the total magnetic field data value in this frequency window. Fluctuations in the magnetosheath and in the MPB may be correlated with fluctuations at the ionosphere, since correlation lengths in those regions are larger than the size of these regions, indicating that local resonant effect of wave trains at the ionopause may enhance the atmospheric ion escape at Venus. Our results also show that pickup heavy ions can interact with discontinuities in the magnetosheath of Venus and can destroy ULF wave trains during periods of low solar wind pressure. The results obtained here are compared with a similar previous analysis in the Mars environment.",

  "abstract": "Saturn auroral hiss is intense whistler mode emission similar in morphology to terrestrial auroral hiss, and is observed at high latitude very often in quasiperiodic episodes with a period of approximately 1 hr. Bader et al. (2019) report auroral pulsations that may be due to duskside magnetodisk reconnection. The source of the 1-hr period is not definitively known but has been purported to be due to second harmonic Alfven waves standing along near planet magnetic field lines (Yates et al., 2016). Observations of auroral hiss at high latitude along Cassini proximal orbits are often excellent, and we have focused on an event for which we have concurrent ultraviolet auroral images as well as electron flux data. A series of repeating auroral hiss episodes is observed to initiate near the magnetic field line that traverses a Saturn kilometric radiation source region in each hemisphere, with periodic episodes of hiss recurring at higher L-shells. Magnetic field lines centered on individual hiss episodes have auroral footprints that lie near and within a region of intense auroral ultraviolet emissions. These observations have a parallel in terrestrial return current electron beam-generated auroral hiss seen near magnetic field lines supporting auroral kilometric radiation source regions. Recent findings link periodic plasma injections with Saturn reconnection sites observed preferentially on the duskside. These injections may spawn Saturn kilometric radiation source regions and periodic auroral hiss emission in nearby return current regions.",

  "abstract": "Mars is our planetary neighbor and is now known to host trace levels of organic matter at its surface. However, little is known of the organic molecular composition or the survival potential for organic biosignatures, such as the enantiomeric excess of amino acids or the carbon chain patterns of lipid hydrocarbons, as a function of depth below the martian surface. The Mars Organic Molecule Analyser (MOMA) is an instrument onboard the Rosalind Franklin rover that is scheduled to be launched to Mars in 2022 as part of the ExoMars mission. This experiment includes a gas chromatograph instrument dedicated to the in situ analysis of organic molecules and their enantiomers present in martian samples collected by the rover at the surface down to 2 m depth. In order to evaluate the performance of the integrated chromatographic system which was selected for the flight model, experiments were carried out with a laboratory setup that reproduced the flight configuration and mimicked the in situ operating conditions. We show that the column instrument package can separate and detect a wide range of organic and inorganic volatile compounds, from noble gases to hydrocarbon chains with up to 29 carbon atoms (C<SUB>29</SUB>). We study the enantiomeric resolution of selected chiral chemical standards and compare our laboratory results to: i. tests performed with the same instrumental setup but using a natural sample spiked with amino acids in order to evaluate the influence of a mineral phase on the analysis, and ii. tests run on a MOMA engineering test unit (ETU) which is representative of the flight model. In each case, tests on the more complex sample and the more flight-like instrument allow a comparison with laboratory results, in order to confirm that laboratory data are reliable for supporting peak identification within flight data. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of the gas chromatographic subsystem to identify a wide range of organic and inorganic volatile compounds, including biomolecular signatures, within the constrained space operating conditions of MOMA. The results form a retention time and mass spectral database for MOMA which will be critical for analysis of the eventual flight data.",

  "abstract": "The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission provides global energetic neutral atom (ENA) observations from the heliosphere and the Earth's magnetosphere, including spatial, temporal, and energy information. IBEX views the magnetosphere from the sides and almost always perpendicular to noon-midnight plane. We report the first ENA images of the energization process in the Earth's ion foreshock and magnetosheath regions. We show ENA flux and spectral images of the dayside magnetosphere with significant energization of ENA plasma sources (above ~2.7 keV) in the region magnetically connected to the Earth's bow shock (BS) in its quasi-parallel configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We also show that the ion energization increases gradually with decreasing IMF-BS angle, suggesting more efficient suprathermal ion acceleration deeper in the quasi-parallel foreshock.",

  "abstract": "This paper focuses on unique aspects of the ionospheric response at conjugate locations over Europe and South Africa during the 7-8 September 2017 geomagnetic storm including the role of the bottomside and topside ionosphere and plasmasphere in influencing electron density changes. Analysis of total electron content (TEC) on 7 September 2017 shows that for a pair of geomagnetically conjugate locations, positive storm effect was observed reaching about 65% when benchmarked on the monthly median TEC variability in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere remained within the quiet time variability threshold of ±40%. Over the investigated locations, the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes showed positive TEC deviations that were in most cases twice the comparative response level in the Northern Hemisphere on the 8 September 2017. During the storm main phase on 8 September 2017, we have obtained an interesting result of ionosonde maximum electron density of the F2 layer and TEC derived from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations showing different ionospheric responses over the same midlatitude location in the Northern Hemisphere. In situ electron density measurements from SWARM satellite aided by bottomside ionosonde-derived TEC up to the maximum height of the F2 layer (hmF2) revealed that the bottomside and topside ionosphere as well as plasmasphere electron content contributions to overall GNSS-derived TEC were different in both hemispheres especially for 8 September 2017 during the storm main phase. The differences in hemispheric response at conjugate locations and on a regional scale have been explained in terms of seasonal influence on the background electron density coupled with the presence of large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances and low-latitude-associated processes. The major highlight of this study is the simultaneous confirmation of most of the previously observed features and their underlying physical mechanisms during geomagnetic storms through a multi-data set examination of hemispheric differences.",

  "abstract": "The Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft completed 126 close Titan flybys from 2004 until 2017. During almost all of them the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument was turned on to search for radio emissions attributed to Titan lightning. Here we report about their nondetection after close inspection of all Titan flybys throughout the Cassini mission. We also infer new and strong constraints on the permissible flash energy and flash rate of potential Titan lightning. The nondetection of lightning flashes by Cassini observations implies that any lightning on Titan must be either very weak, very rare, or does not exist at all, and the latter could be due to cloud electric fields being too low to initiate a discharge. This finding holds important implications for the prebiotic chemistry of Titan and also implies that lightning will not be a significant hazard to the upcoming Dragonfly mission.",

  "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of the orbital state-vector uncertainty is required for the computation of reliable collision probabilities, the association of tracks, as well as the optimal planning of sensor resources. In low Earth Orbits (LEO) neutral atmospheric density uncertainty is the main contributor to orbital state vector uncertainty. Grid-scale model uncertainty on the other hand is, in most cases, the dominating component of atmospheric density uncertainty. <P />Prior research in the field of density uncertainty has been broad. Nowadays multiple authors seem to agree that a first-order stochastic Gauss-Markov process, also known as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP), is an appropriate stochastic representation for density model uncertainties. While many have studied orbital variations due to stochastic grid-scale density uncertainty, it is believed that the work at hand provides for the first time explicit analytic equations for the estimation of orbital uncertainties due to an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that has been optimized for the representation of atmospheric density. It is shown that the long-term in-track position error due to this modified OUP grows with t<SUP>3</SUP> . <P />The presented derivations and their validation build upon prior work by Emmert et al. and Sagnières and Sharf. Numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to validate the findings with two different semi-empirical density models. We also demonstrate that the resulting orbital uncertainty due to the modified OUP in atmospheric density can be estimated using a classical OUP in the relative density error.",

  "abstract": "One near-ubiquitous signature of substorms observed on the ground is the azimuthal structuring of the onset auroral arc in the minutes prior to onset. Termed auroral beads, these optical signatures correspond to concurrent exponential increases in ground ultralow frequency (ULF) wave power and are likely the result of a plasma instability in the magnetosphere. Here, we present a case study showing the development of auroral beads from a Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky camera with near simultaneous exponential increases in auroral brightness, ionospheric and conjugate magnetotail ULF wave power, evidencing their intrinsic link. We further present a survey of magnetic field fluctuations in the magnetotail around substorm onset. We find remarkably similar superposed epoch analyses of ULF power around substorm onset from space and conjugate ionospheric observations. Examining periods of exponential wave growth, we find the ground- and space-based observations to be consistent, with average growth rates of ∼0.01 s<SUP>-1</SUP>, lasting for ∼4 min. Cross-correlation suggests that the space-based observations lead those on the ground by approximately 1-1.5 min. Meanwhile, spacecraft located premidnight and ∼10 R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail are more likely to observe enhanced wave power. These combined observations lead us to conclude that there is a magnetospheric counterpart of auroral beads and exponentially increasing ground ULF wave power. This is likely the result of the linear phase of a magnetospheric instability, active in the magnetotail for several minutes prior to auroral breakup.",

Our method considers space architecture design and operation from the subsystem level to capture the coupling between in-situ resource utilization technologies and in-space architecture elements for space resource logistics. A case study involving a multi-mission human Mars exploration campaign is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of existing and proposed in-situ resource utilization technology concepts and system designs. The results can provide us with a better understanding of the benefits and costs of different in-situ resource utilization technologies for interplanetary space transportation. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to understand the impacts of lunar and near-Earth-object's in-situ resource utilization systems on Mars missions. The results of this analysis can help decision-makers determine and optimize the roadmap for in-situ resource utilization technology development.",

  "abstract": "Two-dimensional thermospheric wind fields, at both E and F region altitudes within a common vertical volume, were made using a Scanning Doppler Imager (SDI) at Poker Flat, Alaska, during a substorm event. Coinciding with these observations were F region plasma velocity measurements from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and estimations of the total downward and upward field-aligned current density from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE). This combination of instruments gives an excellent opportunity to examine the spatial characteristics of high-latitude ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and how a process which is triggered in the magnetosphere (the substorm) affects that coupling at different altitudes. We find that during the substorm growth phase, the F region thermospheric winds respond readily to an expanding ionospheric plasma convection pattern, while the E region winds appear to take a much longer period of time. The differing response timescales of the E and F region winds are likely due to differences in neutral density at those altitudes, resulting in E region neutrals being much more \"sluggish\" with regard to ion drag. We also observe increases in the F region neutral temperature, associated with neutral winds accelerating during both substorm growth and recovery phases.",

  "abstract": "Predicting the daily variability of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) is an ongoing scientific challenge. Various methods for predicting EPBs have been developed, however, the research community is yet to scrutinize the methods for evaluating and comparing these prediction models/techniques. In this study, 12 months of co-located GPS and UHF scintillation observations spanning South America, Atlantic/Western Africa, Southeast Asia, and Pacific sectors are used to evaluate the Generalized Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) growth rates calculated from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM). Various assessment metrics are explored, including the use of significance testing on skill scores for threshold selection. The sensitivity of these skill scores to data set type (i.e., GPS versus UHF) and data set size (30, 50, 60, and 90 days/events) is also investigated. It is shown that between 50 and 90 days is required to achieve a statistically significant skill score. Methods for conducting model-model comparisons are also explored, including the use of model \"sufficiency.\" However, it is shown that the results of model-model comparisons must be carefully interpreted and can be heavily dependent on the data set used. It is also demonstrated that the observation data set must exhibit an appropriate level of daily EPB variability in order to assess the true strength of a given model/technique. Other limitations and considerations on assessment metrics and future challenges for EPB prediction studies are also discussed.",

The polar stratosphere temperature and planetary wave (PW) enhancements are found to be unusual from the history for 40 years; hence, it is an \"Extremely-Rare\" SSW. The distinct features of the mesosphere winds were observed during the SSW, in association with the traveling PWs in the stratosphere. The mesosphere zonal winds reversed for about 20 days before the peak SSW. Meteor radar (MR) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)-2 observations indicate that the zonal wind reversal was descended with time, and the reversal was larger over ~72°S than the MR site (62°S). The MR detected the PWs of 14-22 days before and 8-12 days following the SSW in the mesosphere. We further noticed the enhancement of wavenumber 1 signature in the mesosphere during the peak SSW over the polar region. Thus, the polar middle-atmosphere is greatly affected by the SSW.",

  "abstract": "Recent observations in the nightside inner magnetosphere have identified a series of wedge-like spectral structures in the energy-time spectrograms of oxygen, helium, and hydrogen ion fluxes. Although the shapes and distributions of these structures have been characterized by case and statistical studies, their formation mechanism remains unclear. Here we utilize a particle tracing model to reproduce the wedge-like structures successively observed by the twin Van Allen Probes. The model suggests that these structures originate from intermittent substorm injection, and it is the accessibility region of these injected ions that determines their shapes. This mechanism is similar to the formation of another kind of structures, the inner magnetospheric nose-like structures, except that the wedge-like structures are separated from the tail population by the discontinuation of ion injections. This scenario is also supported by the distribution statistics of wedge-like structures, which provides new insights into the dynamics of the magnetotail-inner magnetosphere coupled system.",

  "abstract": "Titan's magnetic environment is a dynamic and unique place. We detect 85 flux ropes during all the Cassini flybys of Titan from 2005-2017. Analysis describing the location of flux ropes in Titan's ionosphere as well as where Titan is in Saturn's magnetosphere shows that the flux ropes are more often found when Titan is in the noon sector of Saturn's magnetosphere. A secondary peak of occurrence is found in the postmidnight area, where it is expected that Saturn's magnetosphere is highly dynamic. We also find that the flux rope occurrence is correlated with the average electron density profile of Titan's ionosphere. A force-free model is utilized to estimate the radii and core magnetic field strength of the flux ropes. We find a large range of radii from 150-500 km with a small number of very large flux ropes (500-1,000 km) and a range of core field strengths of 1-15 nT, again with some much larger values(20-40 nT). The model also shows that more flux ropes are right-handed than left-handed in twist; however, we are unable to determine if there is a physical reason or if this is due to an observer bias. Additionally, we evaluate the goodness of fit for the model in each instance and conclude that, on average, the flux ropes may be better represented by a non-force-free model.",

The lines are excited by electron collisions and spontaneously decay resulting in UV emission that is diagnostic of the plasma conditions. In a previous study we used a single Maxwellian distribution to model the UV spectra obtained by the Cassini UVIS instrument in January 2001. We now try to determine the fraction of hot electrons using a double Maxwellian distribution where the core, thermal electron distribution is combined with a hot electron distribution, also assumed to be a Maxwellian. This spectral emission model does not well constrain the fraction of hot electrons, which can be seen by the χ<SUP>2</SUP> output. By using physical chemistry modeling of equilibrium conditions, we determine the fraction of hot electrons. Our physical chemistry model shows that in order to match the plasma composition and temperatures near the orbit of Io during the Cassini flyby of Jupiter we need the hot electrons to comprise &lt;0.3% of the total electron density.",

Within the middle thermosphere, direct observations of such waves are extremely sparse. The Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) far-ultraviolet imaging spectrometer is able to observe the middle thermosphere from geostationary orbit. During October 2018, a special observational campaign was performed, designed to identify atmospheric waves. Signatures in the 135.6-nm O airglow were seen that move northward with time, away from the southern polar region. These are consistent with a large-scale atmospheric gravity wave. These results are the first time 135.6-nm airglow has been used to track such a wave and highlight the ability of GOLD to observe such waves, even when at a modest amplitude, and track their motion.",

  "abstract": "In addition to traditional interest by various governments in space exploration, there is growing interest in private missions to Mars and other deep space destinations within the next decade. Private missions could consider persons not restricted by radiation limits; however there remains an interest in the level of risk to be encountered. The major risk for space travel is cancer from galactic cosmic rays (GCR), while circulatory diseases in suggested in some but not all epidemiology studies at modest doses (&lt;1 Gy) and detriments in cognition are suggested by rodent studies following acute irradiation with moderate doses of heavy ions. The GCR are not easily shielded since they consist of high energy protons, heavy ions and secondary radiation produced in shielding and tissue. Furthermore heavy ions are more effective per unit dose in causing solid cancers compared to gamma-rays. In addition non-targeted effects (NTEs) are suggested by most low dose radiobiology studies to increase biological effectiveness for low doses of high LET radiation. Astronauts and cosmonauts are typically above 40-y, while younger aged persons could participate in private space missions. In this paper, we describe cancer and circulatory disease risks for a 940 d Mars mission for average solar minimum conditions for persons of varying ages from 20 to 60 years. For the first-time NTEs are considered in Mars mission cancer risk predictions. Cancer morbidity risks and 95% confidence intervals for age 20-y persons are predicted as 20.9% [7.04, 51.4] and 12.7% [4.97, 29.3] for females and males, respectively. We find that cancer fatality risks decline with age of exposure while circulatory disease risks are nearly independent of age of exposure. The ratio of cancer to circulatory disease fatalities decreases from about 8-to-1 at 20 y to 5-to-1 at 60 y in females and 4-to-1 and 2.5-to-1 in males with about 2-times higher loss of life expectancy for cancer deaths compared to circulatory related deaths, indicating the much higher importance of cancer risk compared to circulatory disease risks for persons participating in space missions.",

  "abstract": "Stellar occultation is a powerful method to study vertical structure of the Venus night mesosphere. The UV channel of SPICAV spectrometer, operated in 2006-2014 on board ESA's Venus Express orbiter, allowed retrieval profiles of atmospheric gases (CO<SUB>2</SUB>, SO<SUB>2</SUB>, and O<SUB>3</SUB>) and aerosols. It was also able to register different UV emissions around Venus (nitric oxide airglow, Lyman-α) overlapping the absorption features at 120-300 nm. Several calibration steps convert the raw data to atmospheric transmission spectra used for the retrievals. The systematic errors of resulted gaseous concentrations mainly relate to: (i) an uncertainty of the wavelength to pixel assignment; (ii) a portion of emitting light contaminating the analyzed transmission spectra. In the present paper, we have tested a new method of the wavelength-to-pixel assignment based on the spectral features of measured stars. Secondly, using imaging capabilities of the instrument, we have demonstrated an accurate separation between different kinds of registered signal: extended UV nightglow, light from a point star, transmitted through the atmosphere, and, sometimes, solar light, scattered by Venus dusk. The efficiency of two approaches performing the separation was studied. As a result, corrected transmission spectra provided retrievals of gaseous concentrations with 20-40% higher precision respectively to those processed in previous SPICAV stellar occultation studies (Montmessin et al., 2011, Icarus 216, 82; Piccialli et al., 2015, Planet.

  "abstract": "A new model of exospheric temperatures has been developed, with the objective of predicting global values with greater spatial and temporal accuracy. From these temperatures, the neutral densities in the thermosphere can be calculated, through use of the Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter radar Extended (NRLMSISE-00) model. The exospheric temperature model is derived from measurements of the neutral densities on several satellites. These data were sorted into triangular cells on a geodesic grid, based on location. Prediction equations are derived for each grid cell using least error fits. Several versions of the model equations have been tested, using parameters such as the date, time, solar radiation, and nitric oxide emissions, as measured with the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. Accuracy is improved with the addition of the total Poynting flux flowing into the polar regions, from an empirical model that uses the solar wind velocity and interplanetary magnetic field. Given such inputs, the model can produce global maps of the exospheric temperature. These maps show variations in the polar regions that are strongly modulated by the time of day, due to the daily rotation of the magnetic poles. For convenience the new model is referred to with the acronym EXTEMPLAR (EXospheric TEMperatures on a PoLyhedrAl gRid). Neutral densities computed from the EXTEMPLAR-NRLMSISE-00 models combined are found to produce very good results when compared with measured values.",

  "abstract": "We ran the IRAP Plasmasphere Ionosphere Model (IPIM) for several flux tubes at different distances from Earth for very quiet conditions, in order to model the convection and corotation transport of closed flux tubes in the plasmasphere for tilted/eccentric dipolar magnetic field configuration and for solstice and equinox conditions. For each simulation, the model was run for 30 days in order to study the long-term evolution of the plasmasphere-ionosphere system. The goal is to study the combined effect of corotation and convection, which causes eventually a lag of the flux tube motion with respect to the Earth. This combination of nonuniform rotation and subcorotation in average becomes important especially in the outer plasmasphere and causes nonuniform drift of the dipole tilt projection in the plane of the flux tube with time, changing drastically the plasma distribution along this flux tube. In the classical representation of the plasmasphere, the ionosphere only depends on angular Magnetic Local Time (MLT) sector. We show that due to the tilt effect, solar illumination along the flux tube and field-aligned transport varies from one day to the other and causes also a day-to-day variation in the plasma distribution along the tube. This effect implies that a stable representation of the plasmasphere in MLT during quiet conditions is an erroneous view, and no real dynamic equilibrium can be reached, in particular close to the stagnation point.",

We classified the Martian yardangs into three types according to their shapes: long ridge, inverted hull and curvilinear shapes, and found that the number of long ridge yardang fields account for 77.97% of all 394 yardang fields. The mapping results show that the total area of yardang fields is about 734,115 km<SUP>2</SUP>, within which the area of the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) yardangs is about 562,640 km<SUP>2</SUP>. We also identified and digitized individual yardang bodies wider than 500 m in the CTX mosaics. The resultant 466 yardang bodies are subsequently used as samples for statistical analysis of the morphometric parameters. Among all of the orientations, N-S is the dominant orientation of the yardang samples, and the average length and width are 5626 m and 993 m respectively. The length to width ratios vary from 1.2:1 to 46.9:1 within (30°N to 30°S) and vary from 1.5:1 to 46.9:1 in the most studied MFF. The mapping and statistical results provide important information about the spatial distribution of Mars yardangs and their morphological characteristics, which will be valuable to further study of the formation and evolution of Mars yardangs, and the aeolian environment.",

  "abstract": "Previous work suggested that the peak response time of the mass densities of atomic oxygen (O) and molecular nitrogen (N<SUB>2</SUB>) in the thermosphere had more than a 1-day difference relative to the peak of the 27-day periodic variation of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux. In this study, we used the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) to explore the physical mechanisms responsible for the different peak response times of the daytime thermospheric neutral species. It was found that the peak response time of O or N<SUB>2</SUB> mass density corresponds to the time of equilibrium between the contributions from the barometric effect and the change in its abundance. The peak response time of O is shorter than that of thermospheric temperature Tn, due to a dynamic change in the circulation that acts to cancel out the contribution from the barometric process prior to the peak of Tn. On the contrary, the change of N<SUB>2</SUB> abundance contributes further to a decrease of N<SUB>2</SUB> mass density on a constant pressure surface when the thermosphere is expanding. The change of chemical loss leads to a longer peak response time of N<SUB>2</SUB> abundance than that due to barometric motion. Therefore, an equilibrium is reached after the barometric effect turns from expansion (contraction) to contraction (expansion), so that the peak response time of N<SUB>2</SUB> is longer than that of Tn. Moreover, the meridional circulation in the thermosphere modulates the latitudinal dependence of the peak response time of thermospheric neutral species.",

  "abstract": "Ionospheric outflow is the flow of plasma initiated by a loss of equilibrium along a magnetic field line, which induces an ambipolar electric field due to the separation of electrons and ions in a gravitational field and other mass-dependent sources. We have developed an ionospheric outflow model using the transport equations to determine the number of particles that flow into the outer magnetosphere of Jupiter. The model ranges from 1,400 km in altitude above the 1 bar level to 2.5 R<SUB>J</SUB> along the magnetic field line and considers H<SUP>+</SUP> and H3+ as the main ion constituents. Previously, only pressure gradients and gravitational forces were considered in modeling polar wind. However, at Jupiter we need to evaluate the effect of field-aligned currents present in the auroral regions due to the breakdown of corotation in the magnetosphere, along with the centrifugal force exerted on the particles due to the fast planetary rotation rate. The total number flux from both hemispheres is found to be 1.3-1.8 × 10<SUP>28</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> comparable in total number flux to the Io plasma source. The mass flux is lower due to the difference in ion species.

We have selected magnetosheath crossings and applied the Morlet wavelet transform to the electron density and temperature data, obtained from the Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms experiment (ASPERA-3), onboard the Mars Express (MEX). In a study of 9667 magnetosheath crossings observed from 2005 to 2016, we have found 22,912 frequencies with high wave power between 5 and 60 mHz for the electron density data, For about 2/3 of the high wave power periods (63.3%), the most energetic frequencies were identified in the range 5-20 mHz. The analysis of the electron temperature data led to similar results, with 61.9% of the highest power frequencies in the 5-20 mHz range. No significant influence of the solar cycle on the frequencies of ULF waves has been observed in our analysis. The frequencies obtained here are near the O<SUP>+</SUP> gyrofrequency.

  "abstract": "Detailed properties of the spatially periodic auroral beads (ABs) that develop immediately prior to auroral substorm expansion onset on breakup auroral arcs pose stringent observational constraints on the substorm onset process. Theoretical predictions of the cross-field current instability (CCI) are evaluated in terms of these constraints. It is found that CCI satisfies these constraints associated with ABs, that is, their growth rates, wavelengths, and periods, by matching these characteristics well with the theoretical predictions of CCI. Several subtle trends in AB properties are revealed with CCI solutions applied to them. For a given observed wavelength in the ionosphere, waves with longer periods are generated at onset sites at longer downstream distances for both westward and eastward drifting ABs. Waves with higher growth rates are generated by higher drift speeds for a given observed period and for a given observed wavelength by onset sites at closer downstream distances. A distinct group of eastward drifting ABs having long periods and small wavelengths are related to onset sites with relatively high drift speeds and large downstream distances. These revelations indicate that the onset site can occur over a range of downstream distances. ABs possessing two different propagating directions may be accommodated. A two-dimensional equilibrium current sheet can be constructed from the adopted parameters for the current sheet used in CCI solution. Some misunderstandings of CCI are clarified as well. All these findings provide strong evidence for CCI as a viable substorm onset process.",

  "abstract": "We study the Pi3 pulsations (with a period T=15-30 min) that were recorded on December 8, 2017 at ground stations in the midnight sector of the magnetosphere at the latitude range of DP2 current system convective electrojets. We have found that Pi3 are especially pronounced in the pre-midnight sector with amplitude of up to 300 nT and duration of up to 2.5 hrs. The pulsation amplitude rapidly decreased with decreasing latitude from F'=72° to F'=63°. The event was recorded during the steady magnetospheric convection. In the southward Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field, irregular oscillations were detected in the Pi3 frequency range. They correspond to slow magnetosonic waves occurring without noticeable variations in the dynamic pressure Pd. Ground-based geomagnetic observations have shown azimuthal propagation of pulsations with a 0.6-10.6 km/s velocity east and west of the midnight meridian. An analysis of the dynamics of pulsations along the meridian has revealed their propagation to the equator at a velocity 0.75-7.87 km/s. In the projection onto the magnetosphere, the velocities are close in magnitude to the observed propagation velocities of substorm injected electrons. In the dawn-side magnetosphere during ground-observed Pi3 pulsations, compression mode oscillations were recorded. We conclude that propagation of geomagnetic field oscillations in this event depends on the dynamics of particle injections under the action of a large-scale electric field of magnetospheric convection, which causes the plasma to move to Earth due to reconnection in the magnetotail. Small-scale oscillations in the magnetosphere were secondary, excited by the solar wind oscillations penetrating into the magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "The admissible region method provides a reliable orbit initialization framework for space objects with extremely limited observations. In general, the uncertainty of the admissible region is either ignored or treated as a probability distribution. However, the probabilistic characterization requires that one possess exact knowledge of the distribution of all random errors, e.g., the observation process, the constraint parameters, and the observer related information, which may not be available in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we explore the use of Outer Probability Measure (OPM) theory to achieve a more truthful characterization of the uncertainty of the admissible region, dubbed the Possibilistic Admissible Region (PAR+). Considering that the uncertainty of the constraints is epistemic and modeled by possibility functions, a rigorous possibilistic uncertainty representation is achieved without the need of known random statistics of the system. To wit, the method presented herein can be appropriately interpreted as initializing our inference of a dynamical system with a so-called uninformative prior. The developed PAR+ models the uncertainty of the admissible region as an OPM represented by a collection of particles. It provides a method for space object tracking in the presence of assumed ignorance and unknown randomness (i.e. uninformative prior). The PAR+ for the commonly used angles-only and radar measurements are developed and illustrated using simulated scenarios.",

  "abstract": "In the diffusion region of magnetotail reconnection, particle distributions are highly structured, exhibiting triangular shapes and multiple striations that deviate dramatically from the Maxwellian distribution. Fully kinetic simulations have been demonstrated to be capable of producing the essential structures of the observed distribution functions, yet are computationally not feasible for 3D global simulations. The fluid models used for large-scale simulations, on the other hand, do not have the kinetic physics necessary for describing reconnection accurately. Our study aims to bridge fully kinetic and fluid simulations by quantifying the information required to capture the non-Maxwellian features in the distributions underlying the closures used in the fluid code. We compare the results of fully kinetic simulations with observed electron velocity distributions in a magnetotail reconnection diffusion region and use the maximum entropy model to reconstruct electron and ion distributions using various numbers of moments obtained from the simulation. Our results indicate that using only local moments, the maximum entropy model can reproduce many of the features of the distributions: (1) the electron outflow distribution with a tilted triangular structure is reproduced with 21 or more moments in agreement with Ng et al.

Dust storm is a typical activity on Mars; it has strong interaction with atmospheric circulation and will influence the visibility of the Martian surface. To ensure the safety and accuracy for landing, it is meaningful to analyze the probability of dust storm activity during Entry-Descent-Landing (EDL) season in TLAs. First, based on Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and Mars Color Imager (MARCI) Daily Global Maps (MDGMs) from Mars Years 24-31, we identified 882 dust storms within the 2,000 km radius monitor circle of TLA 2 (short for TLA 2-C). Second, the average daily probability of dust storm activity (Adp_ds) in TLA 2-C was calculated, with a range of 0% to 14.13% showing obvious seasonality and discontinuity. Third, we divided TLA 2-C into 0.5° longitude × 0.5° latitude square grids and calculated their spatial probability of dust storm activity. The spatial probability of dust storm in TLA 2-C ranged from 0% to 11.87% and generally reduced from north to south. Finally, according to the temporal and spatial dust storm probability in TLA 2 during EDL season, we suggested the optimal landing time of China's Tianwen-1 mission was in Ls = 20-41° and selected five preferred landing areas with the spatial probability of dust storm &lt;3% for this mission.",

  "abstract": "The full-color photographs of aurora have been taken with digital single-lens reflex cameras mounted on the International Space Station (ISS). Since these photographs do not have accurate time and geographical information, in order to use them as scientific data, it is necessary to calibrate the imaging parameters (such as looking direction and angle of view of the camera) of the photographs. For this purpose, we calibrated the imaging parameters using a city light image taken from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite following the method of Hozumi et al. (2016, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40623-016-0532-z\">https://doi.org/10.1186/s40623-016-0532-z</A>). We mapped the photographs onto the geographic coordinate system using the calibrated imaging parameters. To evaluate the accuracy of the mapping, we compared the aurora taken simultaneously from ISS and ground. Comparing the spatial structure of discrete aurora and the temporal variation of pulsating aurora, the accuracy of the data set is less than 0.3 s in time and less than 5 km in space in the direction perpendicular to the looking direction of the camera. The generated data set has a wide field of view (∼1,100 × 900 km), and their temporal resolution is less than 1 s. Not only that, the field of view can sweep a wide area (∼3,000 km in longitude) in a short time (∼10 min). Thus, this new imaging capability will enable us to capture the evolution of fine-scale spatial structure of aurora in a wide area.",

  "abstract": "In this work, we evaluated the quasi-realistic ionosphere forecasting capability by an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as the background model in the system. The slant total electron contents (TECs) from global International Global Navigation Satellite Systems Service ground-based receivers and from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate are assimilated into the system, and the ionosphere is then predicted in advance during the quiet interval of 23 to 27 March 2010. The predicted ionosphere vertical TEC (VTEC) and the critical frequency foF<SUB>2</SUB> are validated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology VTEC and global ionosondes network, respectively. We found that the ionosphere forecast quality could be enhanced by optimizing the thermospheric neutral components via the EnKF method. The ionosphere electron density forecast accuracy can be improved by at least 10% for 24 hr. Furthermore, the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics/Global Ultraviolet Imager (TIMED/GUVI) [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] observations are used to validate the predicted thermosphere [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>]. The validation shows that the [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] optimized by EnKF has better agreement with the TIMED/GUVI observation. This study further demonstrates the validity of EnKF in enhancing the ionospheric forecast capability in addition to our previous observing system simulation experiments by He et al.

  "abstract": "An understanding of ionospheric conductances is important for models of large-scale dynamics in the Earth's magnetosphere. We parameterize height-integrated Pedersen and Hall conductances in the ionosphere, derived from images of auroral emissions obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme low-altitude orbiting spacecraft, under different interplanetary and solar wind conditions. For the dayside, conductances are parameterized by interplanetary magnetic field clock angle and magnitude, and by season. These dayside conductances are compared to distributions of field-aligned currents determined from measurements of the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamic Response Experiment. We use these currents to spatially determine a return flow region. We find that the return flow regions exhibit marginally larger conductances than those observed in the polar cap. Conductances in summer exceed those in winter for both the return flow and polar cap regions, on average by a factor of 1.2. On the nightside, we track changes in height-integrated conductance across the Southern Hemisphere polar regions during an average substorm, following a substorm onset list derived from the SuperMAG database. Mean conductances peak approximately 0.75 hr after substorm onset, with maximum conductances seen in the 23 hr magnetic local time sector.",

  "abstract": "Developing a computational model for aurora image classification is an important task for polar research. However, the design of the handcrafted features in the traditional methods has insufficient descriptive ability for auroral morphology and is dependent on expert knowledge. In this paper, an automatic aurora image classification framework based on deep learning is proposed to solve the problem. In this framework, three basic deep learning networks—AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet—are used to automatically classify all-sky aurora images via convolution and pooling processes and a back-propagation mechanism, without requiring manual intervention. As shown in the class activation mapping (CAM), the proposed framework can extract the complex auroral feature representations automatically and discriminatively. The results obtained with all-sky aurora images from the Yellow River Station demonstrate that the proposed framework has effective transfer ability and can achieve real-time classification. It is also shown that the proposed method can achieve higher average classification accuracy than the AI-MFLDA method. The statistical auroral occurrence distribution can be obtained based on the classification results. There are dominant morphological characteristics in the four magnetic local time (MLT) regions of the dayside aurora oval, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

  "abstract": "Projections of extreme precipitation are of considerable interest in a range of design and management applications. These projections, however, can exhibit uncertainty that requires quantification to provide confidence to any application they are used in. This study assesses the uncertainty in projected extreme daily precipitation, separated into model, scenario, and ensemble components using the square root error variance (SREV) rationale. For this, 45 projections of daily precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are used, consisting of multiple global circulation models and their ensemble members, for a range of Representative Concentration Pathways, allowing assessment across land-covered areas worldwide. It is found that the uncertainty in dry regions is significantly higher compared to wet regions, raising concerns regarding infrastructure design for the future in arid parts of the world. It is also found that the climate scenarios and initialization contribute significantly to the overall uncertainty, compared to contributions for more nonextreme precipitation simulations. This finding has implications in how design precipitation extremes ought to be projected into the future, with greater attention being paid on a broader selection of emission scenarios and initializations than is the case with projections of nonextreme precipitations.",

  "abstract": "Multispacecraft observations of the magnetosheath responses to various foreshock transients in a single event on 17 March 2004 are reported in this paper. The Cluster spacecraft recorded long-standing large amplitude ULF waves with both compressive and transverse components in the magnetosheath. Additionally, two transient structures with depressions in density and magnetic field were observed in this period. One structure contains greatly heated and significantly deflected plasmas in the middle and a cold solar wind population at its trailing edge, which is identified as a spontaneous hot flow anomaly with a remnant of the foreshock caviton. It is transmitted through the magneosheath and evolved into a magnetosheath cavity. This cavity was subsequently encountered by the Double Star TC-1 spacecraft deeper inside the magnetosheath. Meantime, fluxes of hot ions in the energy range of 5-38 keV exhibit quasiperiodic variations. These energetic ions are earthward with pitch angle distributions of alternately field aligned or antifield aligned. A correlation between its flux variations and the transverse fluctuations of the ULF waves is found. Moreover, magnetosheath filamentary structures with a series of anticorrelated oscillations of density and temperature were observed simultaneously.",

  "abstract": "The low-latitude ionospheric TEC observed by the Beidou geostationary satellite showed large enhancement during 27-30 August 2018 of the storm recovery phase. The cause of the positive ionospheric storm during the recovery phase has yet to be resolved. In this study, multiple observations, including aurora, high-latitude convection, potential, and the TEC maps, were used to study the contributions from the high-speed solar wind to the ionosphere during the recovery phase of the storm. It was found that the high-speed solar wind was effective in modulating the intensity and the size of the auroral oval, high-latitude convection, and potential pattern. The Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model generally reproduced the observed evolution of the ionosphere at high latitudes during the recovery phase of the storm, and it was used to quantitatively investigate the effects of the high-speed solar wind on the recovery phase ionosphere. The results suggested that the high-speed solar wind caused increase of TEC at auroral oval was about 2 TECU. The high-speed solar wind, combined with oscillating interplanetary magnetic field Bz, led to the enhancement of the low-latitude prompt penetrating electric fields and increased the low-latitude TEC of about 2 TECU. Therefore, the high-speed solar wind was a possible driver to the ionospheric positive storm during the recovery phase, but the causes for the more than 10-TECU enhancement at low and middle latitudes during the recovery phase of this event are unknown.",

  "abstract": "Two years after InSight's arrival at Mars, the ExoMars 2020 mission will land on the opposite side of the red planet. Similarly to InSight, which carries the RISE (Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment) radio-science experiment, the ExoMars mission will have on board the Lander Radio-science (LaRa) experiment. The X-band transponders on RISE and LaRa, allowing for direct radio-link between the landers and stations on Earth, are dedicated to the investigation of Mars' deep interior through the precise measurement of the planet's rotation and orientation. The benefit of having LaRa after RISE for the determination of the Mars orientation and rotation parameters is demonstrated and the resulting improved constraints on the interior structure of Mars and, in particular, on its core are quantified via numerical simulations. In particular, we show that the amplitudes of the semi-annual prograde (p<SUB>2</SUB>) and the ter-annual retrograde (r<SUB>3</SUB>) nutations will be determined with a precision of 6 and 4 milliarcseconds respectively by combining 700 days of RISE data with 700 days of LaRa data, about 35% more precise than what is expected from RISE alone. The impact of such an improvement on the determination of the core size of Mars is discussed and shown to be significant.",

  "abstract": "The wet processing of regolith simulant for clay in situ resource utilization (ISRU) on Mars is presented. The two raw materials from the Mars global simulant family, one without clay (MGS-1) and one with clay - sodium montmorillonite smectite - (MGS-1C) were milled and mixed to produce a simulant with small particle size and reduced clay content (MGS-1C/8). All three simulants and the pure clay raw material were extensively characterized using XRF, synchrotron XRD, gas adsorption and gas pycnometry methods. In a straightforward processing approach, MGS-1C/8 was mixed with water and different dispersant approaches were investigated, all of which gave stable slurries. Particle size distribution, rheology, ion concentration, pH and electrical conductivity of these slurries were characterized. The slurry systems can easily be adapted to fit all typical ceramic shaping routes and here parts of varying complexity from slip casting, throwing on a potter's wheel and additive manufacturing, including material extrusion (robocasting) and binder jetting (powder bed 3D printing) were produced. The unique properties of the sodium montmorillonite clay, which is readily accessible in conjunction with magnesium sulfate on the Martian surface, acted as a natural nanosized binder and produced high strength green bodies (unfired ceramic body) with compressive strength from 3.3 to 7.5 MPa. The most elaborate additive manufacturing technique layerwise slurry deposition (LSD) produced water-resistant green bodies with a compressive strength of 30.8 ± 2.5 MPa by employing a polymeric binder, which is similar or higher than the strength of standard concrete. The unfired green bodies show sufficient strength to be used for remote habitat building on Mars using additive manufacturing without humans being present.",

  "abstract": "Whistler and electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonics waves are responsible for scattering and precipitating the energetic plasma sheet electrons that drive the diffuse aurora. These primary electrons with energies in the kiloelectron volt range, simultaneously precipitating in magnetically conjugate regions, produce the secondary electron population and can be reflected by the atmosphere back through the magnetosphere and precipitate into the conjugate region with additional follow-up atmospheric backscatter. Primary, degraded, and secondary electrons can be trapped back into the magnetosphere as they travel back and forth between the two magnetically conjugate ionospheres and continuously delivering their energy to the cold plasma sheet electrons and form the electron thermal fluxes that deposit this energy at the upper ionospheric altitudes. We consider the formation of these heat fluxes focusing on the magnetosphere-ionosphere energy interplay of the entire superthermal electron spectra from 1 eV up to 10 keV and discuss the efficiency of the different spectral energy intervals that contribute to the electron plasma heating at the magnetospheric altitudes. Our parametric studies at L = 6.8, with lower and upper band chorus whistler wave amplitudes of 10 pT and electron cyclotron harmonic wave amplitudes of 1 mVm<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicate the dominant role of the whistler mode in the formation of the electron heat flux coming from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.",

  "abstract": "Energetic electron precipitation leads to increased nitric oxide (NO) production in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. NO distributions in the wintertime, high-latitude Southern Hemisphere atmosphere during geomagnetic storms are investigated. NO partial columns in the upper mesosphere at altitudes 70-90 km and in the lower thermosphere at 90-110 km have been derived from observations made by the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite. The SOFIE NO measurements during 17 geomagnetic storms in 2008-2014 have been binned into selected geomagnetic latitude and geographic latitude/longitude ranges. The regions above Antarctica showing the largest instantaneous NO increases coincide with high fluxes of 30-300 keV precipitating electrons from measurements by the second-generation Space Environment Monitor (SEM-2) Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) instrument on the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES). Significant NO increases over the Antarctic Peninsula are likely due to precipitation of &gt;30 keV electrons from the radiation belt slot region. NO transport is estimated using Horizontal Wind Model (HWM14) calculations. In the upper mesosphere strong eastward winds (daily mean zonal wind speed ~20-30 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 80 km) during winter transport NO-enriched air away from source regions 1-3 days following the storms. Mesospheric winds also introduce NO-poor air into the source regions, quenching initial NO increases. Higher up, in the lower thermosphere, weaker eastward winds (~5-10 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 100 km) are less effective at redistributing NO zonally.",

  "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that global Pc5 pulsations observed by ground-based magnetometers may be accompanied by periodic oscillations in the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere measured by GPS receivers. These TEC observations may provide new insights into magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling mechanisms, especially when combined with other ground-based observational techniques. Presented in this paper is a large-scale morning sector Pc5 event which was observed simultaneously by ground-based magnetometers, two high-frequency Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars, and several Global Positioning System (GPS)/TEC receivers. The transient 2.6 mHz pulsations observed by the ground magnetometers and radars are accompanied by periodic fluctuations in the time rate-of-change of TEC (ROT) at the same frequency. To investigate possible mechanisms for the TEC modulation by ultralow frequency (ULF) waves, we determine the ratios between the spectral amplitudes of the magnetic, ionospheric Doppler velocity and ROT oscillations. The relationship between the simultaneous magnetic field and ionospheric Doppler velocity oscillations can be reasonably well interpreted using the theory of Alfven wave interaction with the thin ionospheric layer. Though the observed ratio between ROT and Doppler velocity amplitudes can be explained by the occurrence of local steep gradient of the topside ionosphere plasma at auroral latitudes, the responsible modulation mechanism cannot be considered as firmly established.",

  "abstract": "Due to differences in solar illumination, a geomagnetic field line may have one foot point in a dark ionosphere while the other ionosphere is in daylight. This may happen near the terminator under solstice conditions. In this situation, a resonant wave mode may appear, which has a node in the electric field in the sunlit (high conductance) ionosphere and an antinode in the dark (low conductance) ionosphere. Thus, the length of the field line is one quarter of the wavelength of the wave, in contrast with half-wave field line resonances in which both ionospheres are nodes in the electric field. These quarter waves have resonant frequencies that are roughly a factor of 2 lower than the half-wave frequency on the field line. We have simulated these resonances using a fully three-dimensional model of ULF waves in a dipolar magnetosphere. The ionospheric conductance is modeled as a function of the solar zenith angle, and so this model can describe the change in the wave resonance frequency as the ground magnetometer station varies in local time. The results show that the quarter-wave resonances can be excited by a shock-like impulse at the dayside magnetosphere and exhibit many of the properties of the observed waves. In particular, the simulations support the notion that a conductance ratio between day and night foot points of the field line must be greater than about 5 for the quarter waves to exist.",

  "abstract": "The open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere varies during substorms as a result of dayside and nightside reconnection. The open flux can be calculated from the area of the polar cap, delineated by the open-closed field line boundary (OCB). This study presents a superposed epoch analysis of the location of the OCB and the change in the magnetic flux content in individual nightside MLT sectors during substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases. Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the IMAGE satellite are used to derive a proxy of the OCB location. In the hour prior to substorm onset, the total nightside flux content increases by up to 0.12 GWb on average, resulting in an equatorward expansion of the OCB. Following substorm onset, the OCB contracts toward the pole as the open magnetic flux content decreases by up to 0.14 GWb on average, but the rate of decrease of the total nightside open flux content differs by 5-66% between the three IMAGE far ultraviolet instruments. The OCB does not contract poleward uniformly in all nightside magnetic local time (MLT) sectors after substorm onset. Close to the substorm onset MLT sector, the OCB contracts immediately following substorm onset; however, the OCB in more dawnward and duskward MLT sectors continues to expand equatorward for up to 120 minutes after substorm onset. Despite the continued increase in flux in these sectors after substorm onset, the total nightside flux content decreases immediately at substorm onset, indicating that the nightside reconnection rate exceeds the dayside rate following substorm onset.",

The calculations show that the eigen oscillation amplitudes increase greatly from the magnetopause into the magnetosphere. Presumably, the dayside magnetosphere plays the role of a sort of focusing lens for ULF FMS waves. Hence, one can expect a significant increase in the magnetosonic oscillation amplitudes in the inner part of the magnetosphere when the FMS oscillations (determining the magnetopause eigen oscillation amplitudes) are amplified in the magnetosheath.",

  "abstract": "The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft has been in operation around Mars since March 2006. The Context Camera (CTX), aboard MRO, has returned over 110,000 images of Mars at ≈5-6 m/px, providing nearly global coverage. Based on our work, reconstruction of MRO's orbit and camera pointing from ground tracking are offset from the Mars global coordinate system, with the 95th percentile of test points offset by ≈850 m, corresponding to ≈150 CTX pixels. While the original level of accuracy is potentially useful for some applications, providing relative control (image-to-image) and absolute or full control (image-to-ground reference) greatly improves the utility of the data. As a proof-of-concept, we have fully controlled all usable images of Mars Chart 30, Mare Australe, which is poleward of 65°S. This represents 4.7% of Mars's surface area and comprises 9,652 images (≈8% of the CTX catalog as of PDS release #48). The control was produced through a mixture of automated code and manual adjustment and validation, and mosaics were produced with manual input to provide a useful product with the best, most consistent images on top. The data—mosaics and updated SPICE kernels—are available to the community through NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) Imaging and Cartography Annex. The workflow developed for this product is applicable to the remainder of Mars and other planetary bodies.",

  "abstract": "Azimuthal structuring is usually observed within the brightening auroral substorm onset arc; such structure has been linked to the exponential growth of electromagnetic ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves. We present a case study investigating the timing and frequency dependence of such ULF waves on the ground and in the near-Earth magnetotail. In the magnetotail, we observe an increase in broadband wave power across the 10- to 100-s period range. On the ground, the arrival times spread from an epicenter. The onset of longer period waves occurs first and propagates fastest in latitude and longitude, while shorter periods appear to be more confined to the onset arc. The travel time from the spacecraft to the ground is inferred to be approximately 1-2 min for ULF wave periods between 15 and 60 s, with transit times of 60 s or less for longer period waves. This difference might be attributed to preferential damping of the shorter period waves, as their amplitude would take longer to rise above background levels. These results have important consequences for constraining the physics of substorm onset processes in the near-Earth magnetotail and their communication to the ground.",

  "abstract": "Previous work at Titan presented a set of 85 flux ropes detected during Cassini flybys of Titan from 2005 to 2017. In that study a force-free model was used to determine the radii and axial magnetic field of the flux ropes. In this work we apply non-force-free models. The non-force-free model shows an improvement in the number of flux ropes that can be fitted with a model, along with improved uncertainties and χ<SUP>2</SUP> values. A number of asymmetries and features in the magnetometer data cannot be reproduced by either model; therefore, we deform the force-free model to show that small deformations can replicate these features. One such deformation is to use an elliptical cross section, which replicates a plateau in magnetic field strength along with asymmetries on either side of the center of the flux ropes. Additionally, we explore the properties of bending a flux rope, where we find that minimum variance analysis becomes increasingly degenerate with bending, along with a slight bend causing the switching of the axial field direction from intermediate to maximum variance direction. We conclude that the flux ropes at Titan show aspects of developing flux ropes, compared to other planetary bodies, which exhibit more agreement to the force-free assumptions of mature flux ropes.",

The OSSEs are performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results from the OSSEs demonstrate that the assimilation of ionosphere observations improves the short-term (1 hr) forecasts and analyses. The OSSEs show that the short-term forecasts and analyses are further improved when the ionosphere observations adjust the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature in addition to the ionosphere electron density. Based on an initialized forecast experiment, we find that adjusting the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature also leads to improved forecast skill in the ionosphere on longer time scales (i.e., beyond 1 hr). Additionally, it is shown that using a 1 hr data assimilation cycle, and removal of second-order divergence damping in WACCMX+DART significantly improves tidal amplitudes, which were previously found to be too small. These initial results represent the first whole atmosphere data assimilation system with capabilities to assimilate observations from the troposphere to the ionosphere-thermosphere.",

However, for a given Mastcam image, it can be challenging to locate the corresponding terrains on the orbital view. No method for locating Mastcam images onto orbital images had been made publicly available. The procedure presented here allows users to generate Mastcam image viewsheds, using ArcGIS® software, its built-in Viewshed tool®, and public Mars datasets. This procedure locates onto Mars orbital view the terrains that are observed in a given Mastcam image. Because this procedure uses public datasets, it is applicable to available Mastcam images and to the future ones that will be acquired along the Curiosity rover's path. This procedure can be used by the public to assess scientific questions regarding Martian surface processes and geologic history.

  "abstract": "Large initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis or force-model uncertainties, such as atmospheric density uncertainty are key drivers of the along-track uncertainty growth. Long propagation times may result in the need to use filtering algorithms for orbit determination that do not reside to the assumption of Gaussianity for state errors but estimate the entire probability density function. Adaptive Gaussian mixture based filters have shown promising results in the past. Previous research in the field of orbit determination using Gaussian mixture filters has restricted its attention to initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction. The present paper focuses on the consequences of including realistic, physics-based descriptions of atmospheric density uncertainty into the covariance propagation of the mixture kernels. <P />It is shown that the neglect of process noise, as has been customary for many years, can lead to undesired characteristics of the probability density function (pdf) estimates and that the inclusion of atmospheric density uncertainty process noise, even in cases where it is not the dominant driver of along-track uncertainty growth, is able to correct these deficiencies. For low orbiting satellites with increased ballistic coefficients or small initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction, density uncertainty is the dominant driver of the along-track uncertainty increase. Due to its growth that evolves at least cubic in time, situations may arise which require the usage of Gaussian mixtures also for the process noise when working in Cartesian coordinates. The theoretical foundation for this case is elaborated and an algorithm capable of dynamically switching between a single Gaussian and a Gaussian mixture for the density uncertainty process noise is presented.",

  "abstract": "We give a review of activities of the application of the method of Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients (ANC) for the determination of the cross-sections and astrophysical S-factors of the radiative (p, γ) captures on stable and radioactive nuclei. Number of experiments was done in the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in cooperation with Texas A&amp;M University and Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare -Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (Catania, Italy). The method was introduced in the last decade of the 20th century and was for the first time used to contribute to the intensively studied topic of solar neutrinos. Later its use was extended from Li, Be and B element region to the CNO cycle and above. The obtained results were found (where other measurements were available) compatible with other indirect methods and even with direct measurements. The method was tested in measurements performed using solid state detectors and a magnetic spectrometer. While the direct measurements increasingly reach higher Z isotopes, the advantage of the ANC and other indirect methods in general is still crucial to determine the astrophysical S-factors where short living isotopes participate e.g. in 11 C(p, γ) 12 N, 12 N(p, γ) 13 O and 13 N(p, γ) 14 O. The ANC method can also provide predictions for reactions with mirror nuclei. Other uses of ANCs are also discussed.",

  "abstract": "Insufficiently accurate magnetic-field-line mapping between the aurora and the equatorial magnetosphere prevents us from determining the cause of many types of aurora. An important example is the longstanding question of how the magnetosphere drives low-latitude (growth-phase) auroral arcs: a large number of diverse generator mechanisms have been hypothesized but equatorial magnetospheric measurements cannot be unambiguously connected to arcs in the ionosphere, preventing the community from identifying the correct generator mechanisms. Here a mission concept is described to solve the magnetic-connection problem. From an equatorial instrumented spacecraft, a powerful energetic-electron beam is fired into the atmospheric loss cone resulting in an optical beam spot in the upper atmosphere that can be optically imaged from the ground, putting the magnetic connection of the equatorial spacecraft's measurements into the context of the aurora. Multiple technical challenges that must be overcome for this mission concept are discussed: these include spacecraft charging, beam dynamics, beam stability, detection of the beam spot in the presence of aurora, and the safety of nearby spacecraft.",

  "abstract": "LaRa is a radio-science payload of the ExoMars 2020 mission. The LaRa instrument consists of an X-band transponder accompanied by a set of three antennas and three RF cables, all mounted on the stationary ExoMars surface platform. This instrument is designed to measure with a couple of mHz of accuracy the Doppler shift induced by the variations in Mars rotation and orientation on a direct-to-Earth round-trip radio link. The main scientific objective of the LaRa experiment is to constrain the interior structure of Mars by precisely measuring the nutations of the planet's spin axis. LaRa's measurements will also be used to refine the rotation model of Mars and infer constraints on the dynamic of its atmosphere. This paper aims at characterising the impact of different parameters, related to the design of the LaRa instrument itself and to its operations, on the determination of the rotation and orientation parameters of Mars, and especially on the nutation parameters. Among other quantities, we analyze the effects of the measurements noise, the tracking pass length and occurrence, the mission duration, the radio signal elevation and azimuth in the lander sky, the blackout periods, and the onboard power availability. The work is a comparative study, where we examine different scenarios/cases with respect to a nominal one. From this study, general conclusions can be drawn on the nutation determination from direct-to-Earth Doppler data provided by a landed mission (like InSight). This study provides quantitative inputs that can be used for the programmatic and operation strategy of a radio-science experiment from a lander. In particular, we show that regular tracking from both East and West sides of the lander (i.e. at Earth-rises and Earth-sets) is mandatory to best fit the rotation parameters. Since power issues are frequent on solar-powered landers, we might have to wait for the spacecraft batteries to recharge before operating LaRa. This study shows that turning on LaRa up to one hour after sunrise (i.e. ≤15<SUP>∘</SUP> of Sun elevation) is acceptable, while requiring higher elevation of the Sun to operate LaRa would significantly reduce its science return. One can finally mention that blackout periods of any kind would compromise the scientific achievement of the LaRa experiment if last too long (hundreds of days).",

Autonomous navigation based on these crater features can obtain excellent navigation performance, which is one of the most important navigation methods for future planetary exploration. This paper presents a new method to estimate the attitude and position of spacecraft based on crater measurement uncertainty. Firstly, the error distribution of craters' localization is introduced, considering the characteristics of edge detection in crater images. Then, the error uncertainty of crater localization is described by the error ellipse and the influence of related factors on the crater localization error is analyzed. Further, in consideration of the characteristics that the localization errors are anisotropic, correlated and non-identically distributed, the weighted matrix of different craters is constructed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the error uncertainty matrix. Thereafter the weighted matrix is integrated into the attitude and position estimation algorithm. As a result, the weighted measurement uncertainty method for crater-based pose estimation is formed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by Monte Carlo simulation.",

The focus of our study is understanding how current modeling approaches may predict the global ionosphere for geomagnetic storms (as studied through 35 storms during 2000-2016). Prediction approach uses physics-based modeling without any manual model adjustment, quality control, or selection of the results. Our goal is to understand to what extent current physics-based modeling can be used in total electron content (TEC) prediction and explore uncertainties of these prediction efforts with multiday lead times. The ionosphere-thermosphere model runs are driven by actual interplanetary conditions, whether those data come from real-time measurements or predicted values themselves. These model runs were performed by the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)-produced global ionospheric maps (GIMs) were used to validate model TEC estimates. We utilize the True Skill Statistic (TSS) metric for the TEC prediction evaluation, noting that this is but one metric to assess predictive skill and that complete evaluations require combinations of such metrics. The meanings of contingency table elements for the prediction performance are analyzed in the context of ionosphere modeling. Prediction success is between about 0.2 and 0.5 for weak ionospheric disturbances and decreases for strong disturbances. We evaluate the prediction of TEC decreases and increases. Our results indicate that physics-based modeling during storms shows promise in TEC prediction with multiday lead time.",

  "abstract": "The terrestrial magnetosphere is perpetually exposed to and significantly deformed by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the solar wind. This deformation is typically detected at discrete locations by space- and ground-based observations. Earth's aurora, on the other hand, is a globally distributed phenomenon that may be used to elucidate magnetospheric deformations caused by IMF variations, as well as plasma supply from the deformed magnetotail to the high-latitude atmosphere. We report the utilization of an auroral form known as the transpolar arc (TPA) to diagnose the plasma dynamics of the globally deformed magnetosphere. Nine TPAs examined in this study have two types of a newly identified morphology, which are designated as \"J\"- and \"L\"-shaped TPAs from their shapes and are shown to have antisymmetric morphologies in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, depending on the IMF polarity. The TPA-associated ionospheric current profiles suggest that electric currents flowing along the magnetic field lines (field-aligned currents [FACs]), connecting the magnetotail and the ionosphere, may be related to the \"J\"- and \"L\"-shaped TPA formations. The FACs can be generated by velocity shear between fast plasma flows associated with nightside magnetic reconnection and slower background magnetotail plasma flows. Complex large-scale TPA FAC structures, previously unraveled by an magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation, cannot be elucidated by our observations. However, our interpretation of TPA features in a global context facilitates the usage of TPA as a diagnostic tool to effectively remote sense globally deformed terrestrial and planetary magnetospheric processes in response to the IMF and solar wind plasma conditions.",

  "abstract": "This paper examines the response of the upper atmosphere to equatorial Kelvin waves with a period of ∼3 days, also known as ultrafast Kelvin waves (UFKWs). The whole atmosphere model Ground-to-topside model of Atmosphere and Ionosphere for Aeronomy (GAIA) is used to simulate the UFKW events in the late summer of 2010 and 2011 as well as in the boreal winter of 2012/2013. When the lower layers of the model below 30-km altitude are constrained with meteorological data, GAIA is able to reproduce salient features of the UFKW in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere as observed by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder. The model also reproduces ionospheric response, as validated through comparisons with total electron content data from the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite as well as with earlier observations. Model results suggest that the UFKW produces eastward-propagating ∼3-day variations with zonal wavenumber 1 in the equatorial zonal electric field and F region plasma density. Model results also suggest that for a ground observer, identifying ionospheric signatures of the UFKW is a challenge because of ∼3-day variations due to other sources. This issue can be overcome by combining ground-based measurements from different longitudes. As a demonstration, we analyze ground-based magnetometer data from equatorial stations during the 2011 event. It is shown that wavelet spectra of the magnetic data at different longitudes are only in partial agreement, with or without a ∼3-day peak, but a spectrum analysis based on multipoint observations reveals the presence of the UFKW.",

  "abstract": "We present an analysis of planetary-scale oscillations during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events based on data obtained from a meteor radar located at Mohe (MH, 53.5°N, 122.3°E), the Aura satellite and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 data (MERRA2). The planetary-scale oscillations in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region during eight SSW events from 2012 to 2019 have been statistically investigated. Our analysis reveals that the enhancement or the generation of westward propagating quasi 16-day oscillation with wavenumber 1 (W1) is a common feature during SSWs over MH. A strong enhancement of the quasi 4-day oscillation during the 2018/2019 SSW is captured by both radar and satellite observations. The amplified quasi 4-day oscillation has a period of ~4.3 days in both meridional and zonal winds and with a wavenumber of W2 in the zonal component. Using the meteor radar and MERRA2 data, the vertical structure of the quasi 4-day oscillation from the stratosphere to the lower thermosphere is derived. The upward propagating feature of the quasi 4-day oscillation in the meridional component indicates that the oscillation is very likely generated in the lower mesosphere. The mesospheric zonal wind reversal after an elevated stratopause event is observed during the SSW, which results in a negative meridional gradient of the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity. Our results not only reveal that the amplified quasi 4-day oscillation in the MLT region is associated with the 2018/2019 SSW but also suggest that the amplification is originally generated around 60 km due to barotropic/baroclinic instability and propagates upward to MLT region.",

The error limits of the original calibrated Phoenix pressure data currently available in NASA's Planetary Data System (Dickinson, 2008) are from -5.3 Pa to +3.5 Pa. Further, almost no temperature-dependent error exists in the original calibrated MET-P data. However, we identify a previously unknown error source, temperature hysteresis, which causes minor peaks in the measured pressure curve (&lt;0.4 Pa). A version of the Phoenix pressure data generated by applying all the error compensations developed in this study is available on Mendeley Data (Kahanpää et al., 2019). The study is based on the re-analysis of the original test data of MET-P, the analysis of the engineering data measured during the mission on Mars and during the interplanetary cruise, and laboratory tests with the Reference Model of the MET-P sensor. Temperature dependent errors are evaluated by comparing the readings of two sensor heads with different sensitivities, measuring the same quantity. The principle of this method is applicable also for other types of instruments.",

  "abstract": "A geometric wedge model of the near-Earth nightside plasma sheet is used to derive a wave equation for low-frequency shear flow-interchange waves which transmit E→×B→ sheared zonal flows along magnetic flux tubes toward the ionosphere. Discrepancies with the wave equation result used in Kalmoni et al.

The shear flow-interchange instability appears to be responsible for substorm onset. The wedge wave equation is used to compute rough expressions for dispersion relations and local growth rates in the midnight region of the nightside magnetotail where the instability develops, forming the auroral beads characteristic of geomagnetic substorm onset. Stability analysis for the shear flow-interchange modes demonstrates that nonlinear analysis is necessary for quantitatively accurate results and determines the spatial scale on which the instability varies.",

  "abstract": "Very low frequency (VLF) auroral hiss at Kannuslehto (KAN), Finland, was analyzed with reference to the progress of 98 isolated magnetic substorms measured during the winter months of 2015-2018. Of these, 91 were accompanied by auroral hiss during the substorm growth phase. No auroral hiss was recorded during the expansion and recovery phases. We found that auroral hiss was observed under rising polar cap (PC) index, showing an increased solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere during the substorm growth phase. We also found that in 58 of the 65 events studied, KAN was located in the vicinity of enhanced field-aligned currents (FACs) during auroral hiss occurrence. For the first time, it was established that auroral VLF hiss generation in the equatorial part of the auroral oval is a typical signature of a substorm growth phase.",

  "abstract": "Over the past two decades mounting evidence demonstrated that terrestrial weather significantly influences the dynamics and mean state of the thermosphere. While important progress has been made in understanding how this coupling occurs on hourly to daily time scales, large uncertainty still exists on this effect around intraseasonal (∼30-90 days) time scales. In this work, analyses of Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics-Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry temperatures near 110 km and Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer cross-track winds near 260 km reveal prominent intraseasonal oscillations in the equatorial (±15°) zonal mean lower and middle thermosphere. Similar intraseasonal oscillations are found in the amplitudes of the diurnal eastward propagating tide with Zonal Wavenumber 3 (DE3) and the quasi-3-day ultrafast Kelvin wave, two prominent ultrafast tropical waves (UFTWs) excited by deep tropical tropospheric convection. Numerical simulations from the Specified-Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended demonstrate a significant connection between these UFTW and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Compared to the boreal winter mean state, thermospheric UFTW amplitudes are larger (+5 to +12%) during MJO Phases 2-3 and smaller (-3% to -12%) during MJO Phases 6-8. Significant variations are also found with respect to the phase of the mesospheric semiannual oscillation (MSAO) and stratospheric quasi-biannual oscillation (SQBO), with larger (±12-16%) thermospheric amplitudes during westward MSAO/SQBO phase and smaller (±3-6%) amplitudes during eastward MSAO/SQBO phase, in accordance with theoretical interpretations. This study suggests that UFTW may play a large role in coupling tropospheric intraseasonal variability to the thermosphere, raising important questions including implications for the whole atmosphere system.",

  "abstract": "A framework is developed to model photoionization of metals deposited in the lower ionosphere as a result of meteoric ablation and photodetachment of electrons from negative ions of the Earth's ionosphere due to sources of emission other than solar radiation. A wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum including cases of negligible, moderate, and significant absorption of radiation is considered. We limit our scope to the radiation transport through lower ionospheric regions, in case when molecular oxygen, O<SUB>2</SUB>, is considered as the main absorber of radiation as photoabsorption due to ozone is only effective at stratospheric altitudes and molecular nitrogen, N<SUB>2</SUB>, is transparent to radiation with wavelengths longer than ∼100 nm. We model photon transport in an exponential atmosphere and derive efficient differential representations of the problem in case of negligible photoabsorption and constant pressure approximations. Photoabsorption asymmetry in the atmosphere is demonstrated in case of photons with absorption scales comparable to the scale height of the atmosphere. The application of the model to photoionization in the lower ionosphere is demonstrated by considering photoionization of meteoric species due to photons of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band system of N<SUB>2</SUB> observed in the aurora and in the lightning-induced transient luminous events.

  "abstract": "Total Electron Content (TEC) is used for calculation of Ionospheric delay. The Precise forecast of TEC is useful to correct the range measurements. TEC depends on the time of measurement, solar radiation (SSN &amp; F10.7), geomagnetic index (AP &amp; KP), season and geographic location of the user. In this paper, Cokriging geostatistical method is applied to build the Surrogate Model (COKSM) to estimate the range error based on predicted Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC). The model is tested with pseudo-range measurements of L5 &amp; S band data received from the operational NavIC/GPS receiver positioned at ACSCE, Bangalore, India and also using L1&amp; L2 data of IGS network station. In order to assess the developed model, we have predicted and analyzed the ACSCE-NavIC TEC and IISC-GPS TEC and found that COKSM has predicted well for both NavIC (ACSCE) and GPS (IISC) TEC. The average RMSE of COKSM for NavIC TEC prediction is 1.4920 TECU, mean accuracy is 1.1151 TECU and average correlation coefficient is 0.9854. For GPS TEC prediction COKSM yields average RMSE of 1.1435 TECU, mean accuracy as 0.9080 TECU and average correlation coefficient of 0.9926. The average range error of NavIC and GPS are 0.2126 and 0.0938 meters. In order to estimate the performance of COKSM, it is compared with the Median model, Fourier series, NTCM-GL, SPM, LSTM and TIEGM/WEIMER models. Based on the comparison results it is observed that COKSM predicts well than other prediction models and provides the RMSE of 2.1480 TECU, correlation coefficient as 0.9810 and mean accuracy of 1.4044 TECU, also COKSM performs 4.6% better than Median model, 26.10% better than Fourier series model, 56.44% better than NTCM-GL, 56% superior than SPM model and 4.43% better than LSTM model. Apart from this, COKSM performance is assessed by comparing the forecasting results with TIEGM/WEIMER model during the St. Patrick's storm and found that the average range error of COKSM is 1.65 m and TIEGM/Weimer model yields 2.06 m during the chosen period. These results indicate that COKSM gives better prediction results than other models and suitable for navigation applications.",

  "abstract": "We present a 1:10M scale geologic map of the Niobe Planitia region of Venus (0°N-57°N/60°E-180°E). We herein refer to this area as the Niobe Map Area (NMA). Geologic mapping employed NASA Magellan synthetic aperture radar and altimetry data. The NMA geologic map and its companion Aphrodite Map Area (AMA) cover ~25% of Venus' surface, providing an important and unique perspective to study global and regional geologic processes. Both areas display a regional coherence of preserved geologic patterns that record three sequential geologic eras: the ancient era, the Artemis superstructure era, and the youngest fracture zone era. The NMA preserves a limited record of the fracture zone era, contrary to the AMA. However, the NMA hosts a diverse and rich assemblage of material and structures of the ancient era and structures that define the Artemis superstructure era. These two eras likely overlap in time and account for the formation of basement materials and lower plain units. Impact craters formed throughout the NMA recorded history. Approximately 40% of the impact craters show interior flood deposits, indicating that a significant number of NMA impact craters experienced notable geological events after impact crater formation. This and other geologic relations record a geohistory inconsistent with postulated global catastrophic resurfacing. Together, the NMA and the AMA record a rich geologic history of the surface of Venus that provide a framework to formulate new working hypotheses of Venus evolution and to plan future studies of the planet.",

  "abstract": "Routine monitoring and forecasting of the ionosphere is becoming imperative for our society due to the rapid increase of our reliance on space-based technologies. In the last two decades, satellite remote sensing of the OI 135.6-nm airglow emission has been used as a primary means for inferring the nighttime ionosphere on a global scale. By contrast, the OI 130.4-nm emission, another prominent airglow feature, has long been suggested to be possibly useful for ionospheric remote sensing but has rarely been studied in the literature, partially due to the complexity of the radiative transfer effects involved in the interpretation of this emission. In this study, we explore the use of OI 130.4-nm emission for nighttime ionospheric remote sensing by analyzing the data observed by the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) aboard NASA's Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) mission using a newly developed radiative transfer model. We demonstrate through data analysis and theoretical investigations that limb observations of the OI 130.4-nm emission can be used to complement the OI 135.6-nm emission for a better characterization of the spatial variation of nighttime ionosphere and that nadir observations of the OI 130.4-nm emission can be used to estimate the total electron content (TEC) and the peak density (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) in smoothly varying ionospheric regions more accurately than the OI 135.6-nm emission. We further propose techniques for estimating the ionospheric peak height (h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) using nadir observations of the two emissions. Our results can provide useful information for future ionospheric remote sensing missions.",

  "abstract": "The Mars Workshop on Amazonian and Present-Day Climate was held in June 2018. In this paper, we describe the context and motivations for the Workshop and summarize the proceedings. In particular, we identify 37 high-priority Mars Amazonian and present-day climate questions that arose from presentations and discussion at the workshop, which we group under Key Questions on (1) interpreting the record in the Polar Layered Deposits, (2) identifying and characterizing off-polar climate records (such as large subsurface mid-latitude ice deposits and signs of aqueous alteration), (3) the global budget of dust/sand, salts, and ice, and (4) the global movement of these materials. These 37 questions pertain to processes in the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface active in the present and past, as well as the record they leave of the historical climate. As many of the processes of interest are interconnected, the questions we present are often intertwined; some questions are identified as being of highest-priority because of their larger scientific value and/or that addressing it would contribute important information towards answering many other questions. Related to the high-priority questions, we identify key measurements in the areas of PLD formation and evolution, surface change/interactions, state of global reservoirs, and environmental (surface/atmospheric) conditions. Our objective is for these lists of high-priority questions and measurements to contribute towards discussion of future Mars scientific exploration, and to record the state of Mars Amazonian climate knowledge as of the time of our workshop.",

The second step is the interaction of these electrons with the ionosphere and atmosphere via their elastic and nonelastic collisions and reflection (backscatter) of degraded electrons back to magnetosphere and conjugate ionospheres. This paper presents the results of a newly developed scenario of nonsteady-state electron precipitation dynamics that accounts for magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere energy interplay over the entire energy range of the plasma sheet electron population and their affiliated secondary electrons. It also studies how both magnetically conjugate auroral regions work together with the magnetosphere in the formation of electron precipitation in the region of the diffuse aurora with the energy range coverage from 1 eV up to 10 keV.",

  "abstract": "Rock fractures and veins have been well documented by the Curiosity rover in the lithologies within Gale crater, Mars, and an understanding of the rock mechanical properties of Mars analog samples will improve our capabilities to predict fracture formation conditions (e.g., burial depth and influence of fluids). Data collected by Curiosity's drill allow estimation of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) for rocks that have been sampled by the drill. These estimates reveal that the drilled rock types are considerably weak. Qualitative assessments of rock types that were not drilled, however, suggest that stronger lithologies also exist within Gale crater. Here we integrate experimental testing, computational simulation, and uncertainty quantification to evaluate a predictive approach using the UCS obtained from the rover to determine a suite of mechanical properties for Gale lithologies. This method is demonstrated using analog rocks, specifically iron-cemented sandstone and poorly lithified mudstone. The range of properties determined from sandstone testing is consistent with very strong terrestrial lithologies, and mudstone testing is consistent with extremely weak lithologies, both representative of rock types identified in Gale crater. We evaluate the use of established correlations between measured properties and quantify the uncertainty in using predicted properties to simulate fracture through analog lithologies. Sensitivity analysis indicates the properties of tensile strength and fracture energy derived from the UCS are highly influential properties in predicting fracture. The predictive approach was successful for a well-sorted and well-cemented fine sandstone with no visible porosity and exhibited substantially large errors for analog eolian siltstone lithologies.",

  "abstract": "Throat auroras frequently observed near local noon have been confirmed to correspond to magnetopause indentations, but the generation mechanisms for these indentations and the detailed properties of throat aurora are both not fully understood. Using all-sky camera and magnetometer observations, we reported some new observational features of throat aurora as follows. (1) Throat auroras can occur under stable solar wind conditions and cause clear geomagnetic responses. (2) These geomagnetic responses can be simultaneously observed at conjugate geomagnetic meridian chains in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. (3) The initial geomagnetic responses of throat aurora show concurrent onsets that were observed at all stations along the meridians. (4) Immediately after the concurrent onsets, poleward moving signatures and micropositive bays were observed in the X components at higher- and lower-latitude stations, respectively. We argue that these observations provide evidence for throat aurora being generated by low-latitude magnetopause reconnection. We suggest that the concurrent onsets reflect the instantaneous responses of the reconnection signal arriving at the ionosphere, the followed poleward moving signatures reflect the antisunward dragging of the footprint of newly opened field lines, and the micropositive bays may result from a pair of field-aligned currents generated during the reconnection. This study may shed new light on the geomagnetic transients observed at cusp latitude near magnetic local noon.",

  "abstract": "Due to the limited number and uneven distribution globally of Beidou Satellite System (BDS) stations, the contributions of BDS to global ionosphere modeling is still not significant. In order to give a more realistic evaluation of the ability for BDS in ionosphere monitoring and multi-GNSS contributions to the performance of Differential Code Biases (DCBs) determination and ionosphere modeling, we select 22 stations from Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) to assess the result of regional ionospheric model and DCBs estimates over China where the visible satellites and monitoring stations for BDS are comparable to those of GPS/GLONASS. Note that all the 22 stations can track the dual- and triple-frequency GPS, GLONASS, and BDS observations. In this study, seven solutions, i.e., GPS-only (G), GLONASS-only (R), BDS-only (C), GPS + BDS (GC), GPS + GLONASS (GR), GLONASS + BDS (RC), GPS + GLONASS + BDS (GRC), are used to test the regional ionosphere modeling over the experimental area. Moreover, the performances of them using single-frequency precise point positioning (SF-PPP) method are presented. The experimental results indicate that BDS has the same ionospheric monitoring capability as GPS and GLONASS. Meanwhile, multi-GNSS observations can significantly improve the accuracy of the regional ionospheric models compared with that of GPS-only or GLONASS-only or BDS-only, especially over the edge of the tested region which the accuracy of the model is improved by reducing the RMS of the maximum differences from 5-15 to 2-3 TECu. For satellite DCBs estimates of different systems, the accuracy of them can be improved significantly after combining different system observations, which is improved by reducing the STD of GPS satellite DCB from 0.243 to 0.213, 0.172, and 0.165 ns after adding R, C, and RC observations respectively, with an increment of about 12.3%, 29.4%, and 32.2%. The STD of GLONASS satellite DCB improved from 0.353 to 0.304, 0.271, and 0.243 ns after adding G, C, and GC observations, respectively. The STD of BDS satellite DCB reduced from 0.265 to 0.237, 0.237 and 0.229 ns with the addition of G, R and GR systems respectively, and increased by 10.6%, 10.4%, and 13.6%. From the experimental positioning result, it can be seen that the regional ionospheric models with multi-GNSS observations are better than that with a single satellite system model.",

But, the number of feature points extracted from landing image is so large that the image process is complex and time-consuming, and they do not usually have absolute coordinate information to absolute navigation. Meanwhile, crater is matched difficultly. Hence, ridges, fissures and other surface textures similar to lines are most common visual features of Mars and can be used as navigation landmarks for visual absolute and relative navigation. Firstly, that feature lines matching based on the EDLine algorithm remains invariant to scaling, rotation, and illumination, etc. provides the basis for visual navigation by using feature line. Secondly, feature lines selected as navigation landmarks can be used to absolute navigation and relative navigation respectively, which can implement integrated navigation. In this paper, a novel integrated visual navigation has been designed to finish the precise pin-point landing and overcome the accumulated errors of relative navigation and the limited application range of absolute navigation. Experimental simulation results show that the integrated navigation algorithm solves the limitation of single navigation mode and improves the effectiveness and stability of the algorithm.",

  "abstract": "LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is one of the most important techniques used in remote sensing and photogrammetry to extract high quality features, objects, and models. In this paper, we present an innovative and simple method for ground point filtering from LiDAR point clouds. This method is inspired by nature, where tornadoes destroy buildings and other manmade objects and uproot trees. This simulates the removing of points of building, trees and other objects from LiDAR point clouds. We have imposed that the tornado is a vertical cone with a down vertex and up base. The vertical cone moves on the ground surface so that a network of points is selected as vertex points for the vertical cone. Points that are located inside the cone are removed as non ground points. In other words, the distances between the points and the cone axis are measured, then these distances are compared with calculated distances relative to the cone equation, finally, the points within the cone are removed. To evaluate the proposed method, the datasets provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) are used. The results show that this method can adapt to complex environments and achieve high filtering accuracy. Furthermore, by comparing our method with other methods tested by the ISPRS, the proposed method achieves an average total error of 6.63%, which is smaller than that of the most methods.",

  "abstract": "Throat aurora is a special discrete auroral form often observed at the ionospheric convection throat region near magnetic local noon. Some observational properties of throat aurora have been established, but the geomagnetic response is not yet explored. Using geomagnetic observations from a chain of stations in the Norwegian sector and auroral observations from an all-sky imager and the DMSP satellites, for the first time, we identify geomagnetic responses associated with the occurrence of throat aurora. These variations are well explained by combining the models of flux transfer events and throat aurora. The estimated increase in ionospheric equivalent current confirms the association of throat aurora with ground observations. The results provide further evidence for throat aurora being associated with magnetopause reconnection. Based on the observational features, a new association of geomagnetic variations with throat aurora may be defined to reflect their occurrence at high latitudes near local noon.",

  "abstract": "The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft has been in orbit around Mars since March 2006. The Context Camera (CTX) on MRO has returned over 115,000 images of the planet at approximately 5-6 m per pixel, providing nearly global coverage. During that time, Mars has gone through nearly seven of its own years, changing solar distance from 1.38 to 1.67 AU and the corresponding solar flux by 45% due to its orbital eccentricity. Seasonal effects and transient phenomena affect atmospheric transparency. These changes, along with an aging detector, prevent easily equalizing images to create a visually smoothly illuminated product from CTX images. We have developed a method, based on previous work by other researchers for other data sets, to mitigate almost all brightness variations between images in order to create the appearance of an evenly illuminated, practically seamless mosaic. We describe how the process works, which uses a reference source to tie brightness values, and demonstrate its effects across Mars' surface. While the workflow developed for this product is applicable to other planetary bodies, it requires a reference source, which may not yet exist.",

  "abstract": "We present a 1:10-M-scale geologic map of the Aphrodite Map Area (AMA) of Venus (0°N-57°S/60-80°E). Geologic mapping employed NASA Magellan synthetic aperture radar and altimetry data. The AMA geologic map, with detailed structural elements and geologic units covering over one eighth of Venus' surface, affords an important and unique perspective to test models of global-scale geologic processes through time. Geologic relations record a history inconsistent with global catastrophic resurfacing. The AMA displays a regional coherence of preserved geologic patterns that record three sequential geologic eras: the ancient era, the Artemis superstructure era, and the youngest fracture zone era. The ancient era and Artemis superstructure, with a footprint covering more than 25% of the surface, are recorded in the Niobe Map Area to the north. The latter two eras likely overlap in time. The fracture zone domain, part of a globally extensive province, marks the most spatially focused tectonomagmatic domain within the AMA. Impact craters are both cut by and overprint fracture zone structures. Twelve percent of AMA impact craters that occur within the fracture zone domain predate or formed during fracture zone development. This observation indicates the relative youth of the fracture zone era and is consistent with the possibility that this domain remains geologically active. The AMA records a rich geologic history of large tract of the surface of Venus and provides an important framework to formulate new working hypotheses of Venus evolution and contribute to planning future studies of the surface of planets.",

We use the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System satellite measurements, for the first time, to present the responses of the equatorial field-aligned drift during the 2009 sudden stratosphere warming (SSW). The observations show that the equatorial field-aligned drift presents a southward disturbance in the morning sector and a large northward disturbance in the afternoon sector and gradually shifts to later local time during the SSW. Further, this new finding of semidiurnal disturbance in field-aligned drift can well explain the hemispheric differences of the responses of the total electron content to the SSW. Based on the whole atmosphere model Ground-to-topside model of Atmosphere and Ionosphere for Aeronomy, it is suggested that the meridional wind can contribute to the disturbance field-aligned drift. Our results give a new perspective for understanding the ionospheric perturbations during SSWs.",

  "abstract": "The exchange of energy between the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere thermosphere system is not well understood. One of the parameters that is important in the lower thermosphere is atomic oxygen. It has recently been observed that atomic oxygen is higher in summer at ∼95 km. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of the upper thermosphere to lower thermospheric atomic oxygen using the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM). We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) to drive the lower atmospheric boundary of atomic oxygen in GITM between ∼95 and 100 km and compare the results with the current mass spectrometer incoherent scatter (MSIS) driven GITM. MSIS has higher atomic oxygen in the winter hemisphere while WACCM-X has higher atomic oxygen in the summer hemisphere. The reversal of atomic oxygen distribution affects the pressure distribution between 100 and 120 km, such that the hemisphere with larger O number density has stronger equatorward winds, and lower temperature mainly due to adiabatic and radiative cooling. This affects thermospheric scale heights such that the hemisphere with more O has lower N<SUB>2</SUB> and thus enhanced O/N<SUB>2</SUB>. This behavior is observed in the opposite hemisphere when MSIS is used as the lower boundary for GITM. Overall, O/N<SUB>2</SUB> for WACCM-X driven GITM matches better with the global ultraviolet imager (GUVI) data. We find that the impact of lower thermospheric atomic oxygen on upper thermosphere is not just through diffusive equilibrium but also through secondary effects on winds and temperature.",

  "abstract": "An accurate description of the topside ionosphere is of great importance for space weather applications. Currently, there are two commonly used empirical ionosphere models, that is, NeQuick2 and IRI-2016, that can be used to describe the topside ionosphere. In this study, topside total electron content (TEC) values derived from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are selected to validate the topside ionosphere predictions of the NeQuick2 and IRI-2016 models from 2008 to 2018. The results show that these two models both underestimate the topside ionosphere. Compared with the global topside ionosphere model estimated by LEO-based global positioning system (GPS) observations with orbital altitudes of 500 and 800 km, NeQuick2 and IRI-2016 have similar performances over different latitudes and longitudes. The daily mean root mean square (RMS) values are approximately 4.10 and 2.10 TEC units (TECU) for the region above 500 and 800 km, respectively. The results assessed by the GPS-TEC technique indicate that the performance of the NeQuick2 model is slightly better than that of the IRI-2016 model. The daily mean bias mainly ranges from -1.5 to 1.5 and -3.0 to -1.0 TECU for the regions above 500 and 800 km, respectively. The RMS values for the corresponding parts are 3.50 and 2.74 TECU. Finally, the validation results of the dSTEC method show that the mean bias is -0.43 and -0.20 TECU above 500 and 800 km, respectively. The mean RMS values are 2.04 and 0.72 TECU for the corresponding regions.",

  "abstract": "The present work displays the observations of an afternoon detached aurora along with ionospheric high-latitude trough. The event was observed by DMSP F17 on 19 September 2014. The afternoon detached aurora was isolated from the auroral oval and was located between 12:00-18:00 magnetic local time (MLT) and 65-70° geomagnetic latitude (MLAT). Particle observations indicate that the afternoon detached aurora was produced by energetic ring current ions with energies above 10 keV where the main ion energy was likely to be above the upper limit of DMSP measurement ( 30 keV). Magnetometer observation from the ground implies that the energetic ions were likely scattered by EMIC waves. Both the detached aurora and the auroral oval are found to be well inside the high-latitude trough with MLAT between 64° and 76° (68-80° GLAT). The auroral oval corresponds to a westward (sunward) plasma drift. It is expected that the westward drift transports the low-density plasma in the nightside toward the dayside, leading to the high-latitude trough formation. The afternoon detached aurora was well equatorward of the high-latitude trough, and the corresponding plasma drift was nearly zero. The plasma associated with the detached aurora is expected to be stagnant, and broaden the high-latitude trough equatorward.",

  "abstract": "Focusing on the role of initial condition uncertainty, we use WRF initial perturbation ensemble forecasts to investigate the uncertainty in intensity forecasts of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Rammasun (1409), which is the strongest TC to have made landfall in China during the past 50 years. Forecast results indicate that initial condition uncertainty leads to TC forecast uncertainty, particularly for TC intensity. This uncertainty increases with forecast time, with a more rapid and significant increase after 24 h. The predicted TC develops slowly before 24 h, and at this stage the TC in the member forecasting the strongest final TC is not the strongest among all members. However, after 24 h, the TC in this member strengthens much more than that the TC in other members. The variations in convective instability, precipitation, surface upward heat flux, and surface upward water vapor flux show similar characteristics to the variation in TC intensity, and there is a strong correlation between TC intensity and both the surface upward heat flux and the surface upward water vapor flux. The initial condition differences that result in the maximum intensity difference are smaller than the errors in the analysis system. Differences in initial humidity, and to a lesser extent initial temperature differences, at the surface and at lower heights are the key factors leading to differences in the forecasted TC intensity. These differences in initial humidity and temperature relate to both the overall values and distribution of these parameters.",

Yet the stability of the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) in a global and realistic magnetotail configuration has not been well examined. In this paper, stability of the KBM is evaluated for the two-dimensional Voigt equilibrium of the near-Earth magnetotail based on an analytical kinetic theory of ballooning instability in the framework of kinetic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, where the kinetic effects such as the finite gyroradius effect, wave-particle resonances, and particle drifts motions are included usually through kinetic closures. The growth rate of the KBM strongly depends on the magnetic field line stiffening factor S, which is in turn determined by the effects of the trapped electrons, the finite ion gyroradius, and the magnetic drift motion of charged particles. The KBM is unstable in a finite intermediate range of equatorial β<SUB>eq</SUB> and only marginally unstable at higher β<SUB>eq</SUB> regime for higher T<SUB>e</SUB>/T<SUB>i</SUB> values. The finite ion gyroradius and the trapped electron fraction enhance the stiffening factor that tends to stabilize the KBM in the magnetotail far away from Earth.

It has been postulated that on Mars photocatalytic processes may be relevant for atmospheric methane fluctuation, radicals and perchlorate productions etc. However, to date no investigation has been devoted to modelling the properties of TiO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorbed on olivine surface. <P />The goal of this study is to investigate at atomic level with electronic structure calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), the atomic interactions that take place during the adsorption processes for formation of a TiO regolith. These models are formed with different titanium oxide films adsorbed on olivine (forsterite) surface, one of the most common minerals in Universe, Earth, Mars, cometary and interstellar dust. We propose three regolith models to simulate the principal phases of titanium oxide (TiO, Ti<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> and TiO<SUB>2</SUB>). The models show different adsorption processes i.e. physisorption and chemisorption. Our results suggest that the TiO is the most reactive phase and produces a strong exothermic effect. Besides, we have detailed, from a theoretical point of view, the effect that has the adsorption process in the electronic properties such as electronic density of states (DOS) and oxide reduction process (redox). This theoretical study can be important to understand the formation of new materials that can be used as support in the catalytic processes that occur in the Earth, Mars and Moon. Also, it may be important to interpret the present day photochemistry and interaction of regolith and airborne aerosols in the atmosphere on Mars or to define possible catalytic reactions of the volatiles captured on the Moon regolith.",

Time delays of at least one day for the daily GIMs product limit its value in real-time GNSS applications requiring high precision. Short-time forecasting of GIMs would be a good way to provide a basic background model for single-frequency GNSS users. We propose an improved algorithm for GIMs forecasting based on an adaptive autoregressive (AR) modeling of grid point vertical total electron content (VTEC) values (TVPG). We compare final daily GIMs (BUAG) with precise point positioning (PPP) derived VTEC values (PPPG) and JASON-2 VTEC values (J2TEC) to evaluate the performance of the TVPG and the GIMs based on the prediction of spherical harmonics coefficients (SHPG). The results of the comparison indicate that the TVPG have no obvious overestimate or underestimate with respect to BUAG. While, SHPG overestimates VTEC values in northern latitudes, and underestimates VTEC values in southern latitudes, by more than 2 TECU in some latitudes. Also, according to a comparison with PPPG and J2TEC, the TVPG is essentially better than the SHPG in middle and high latitudes at both low and high solar activity. However, it is worthy of further study to improve the performance of forecast GIMs in low latitudes.",

  "abstract": "The present study investigates dipolarization signatures in the inner magnetosphere using sharp geosynchronous dipolarizations as a reference. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The region of sharp and structured dipolarizations expands earthward while dipolarizations are sustained at geosynchronous orbit; (2) within 5 R<SUB>E</SUB> from Earth, dipolarization signatures are often smooth and gradual, resembling midlatitude positive bays, and they start simultaneously with substorm onsets; (3) off the equator (&gt;0.5 R<SUB>E</SUB>), sharp dipolarizations often take place before geosynchronous dipolarizations. These results can be explained by a model current system with R1-sense and R2-sense current wedges (R1CW and R2CW) if (a) the R1CW, which is located outside, is more intense than the R2CW in total current, (b) the R1CW stays outside of geosynchronous orbit, and (c) the R2CW moves earthward. The model suggests that the region of sharp dipolarizations is confined between the two current wedges, and it expands earthward as the R2CW moves earthward (Result 1). Sufficiently earthward of the R2CW, the remote effect of the R1CW dominates that of the R2CW, and accordingly, magnetic disturbances resemble midlatitude positive bays (Result 2). Since the timing of sharp dipolarizations is determined by the passage of the R2CW, they take place earlier for outer flux tubes. Away from the magnetic equator, sharp dipolarizations can precede geosynchronous dipolarizations especially if the magnetic configuration is stretched (Result 3). Thus, this double-current wedge model explains the variability of dipolarization signatures at different distances, and it may be regarded as a generalized substorm current wedge model.",

  "abstract": "High frequency ionosphere vertical sounding, as an important and representative application for detecting the ionosphere and studying the characteristics of radio propagation, can be utilized to monitor the ionosphere continuously variation and to acquire the ionosphere asymmetrical features of diverse scale above the ionosphere vertical sounding stations. This is a first article on real time application of numerical methods to obtain the parameters of traveling ionosphere disturbances (TIDs) using vertical incident ionograms. In this paper, the distribution of ionosphere electron density with TIDs is constructed using a background ionosphere model superimposed a perturbation theory model. The background ionosphere electron density is modelled by the inversion of vertical incident ionograms which are observed before the appearance of the disturbance. Based on the fourth order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (the so-called ABM) predictor corrector method, instead of Runge-Kutta method, the fast digital ray tracing method is established. According to process of the disturbed trace simulation and parameters inversion, the characteristic parameters of ionosphere disturbance at different detection time can be obtained in real time. The numerical analysis of TIDs is then captured completely.",

Dissipation from tidal forces is major energy source in evolution of Icy moon systems, generically exhibiting a multi-layer structure, with outer solid (ice) and intermediate liquid layers, and solid (rocky) core. Saturn moon Enceladus has been found to eject plumes of water vapour and ice, and very recently, hydrogen molecules, a tentative sign of chemistry supporting microbial life. Purpose of the present work is a preliminary design of a minor electrodynamic tether mission to visit Enceladus. Free tether capture and maneuvering would take the S/C to a Saturn orbit with periapsis very close to the planet and apoapsis at Enceladus orbit, the S/C proved to be then in a 1:2 resonance with the moon, allowing parallel, conveniently slow flybys.

  "abstract": "The formation of field-aligned currents (FACs) of a substorm current wedge is a key element of substorms. Conjunctive observations of a downward FAC during a substorm on 20 December 2007 were made in space by THEMIS satellites and on the ground by geomagnetic field and aurora stations, which provides a unique opportunity to investigate the generation of downward FAC. On the ground, AL index decreased significantly at 04:17:00 UT, denoting the onset of the substorm. The geomagnetic perturbations observed at the postmidnight station KUUJ show that the FAC of the substorm current wedge flowed into the ionosphere. Meanwhile, in space, two THEMIS satellites, THC and THB, the magnetic footprints of which were close to the postmidnight station KUUJ, were located in the near-Earth magnetotail and recorded the outside-in signatures of the plasma sheet thinning first and then the large-scale inside-out propagating plasma flow vortex inferred from the rotation of the flow vector. The magnitude of the FAC was estimated by using the bipolar B<SUB>Y</SUB> perturbations associated with the flow vortex. It is found that this FAC was so strong that it cannot be produced by the time derivative of the vorticity and that the pressure gradient may act in this event. The upward flowing low-energy electrons are the possible carriers for this FAC.",

  "abstract": "Climatology of lunar semidiurnal (LSD) oscillations is constructed using a decade of meteor radar observations over low and equatorial latitudes, and their response to sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events is discussed. Meteor radar-measured hourly zonal and meridional winds in the 80-100 km region over Thumba (8.5°N, 76.9°E) and Kototabang (0.2°S, 100.3°E) have been used to extract the LSD amplitudes during the years 2006-2015 and 2002-2012, respectively. The similarities/discrepancies in the climatology of LSD over low and equatorial latitudes as compared to Vial and Forbes lunar tidal model outputs are discussed. The present results obtained using four individual cases over Thumba and Kototabang indicate that the amplitudes of LSD show pronounced enhancement during polar vortex weakening (PVW) events rather than the conventional SSW events. Case studies presented in this study are characterized by simultaneous occurrence of enhanced LSD amplitudes and reduced solar semidiurnal (SSD) amplitudes, together with the presence of a quasi 16 day (Q16D) wave. Thus, present results corroborate the existence of nonlinear interaction between the Q16D wave and the SSD in the equatorial latitude and low-latitude mesosphere lower thermosphere (MLT) region during PVW/SSW events and their potential contamination to LSD amplitudes. Further, using ground-based magnetometer measurements from the dip equatorial site Tirunelveli (8.7°N, 77°E, 0.23° dip angle), LSD amplitudes in EEJ intensities are also estimated. An excellent association is found between the temporal evolution of LSD amplitudes in zonal winds at MLT region and in the intensity of EEJ, providing a paradigmatic example of MLT-ionosphere coupling.",

  "abstract": "Uncertainty and sensitivity study of three main parameters including length-to-diameter ratio, nozzle radius and total pressure ratio on the drag and heat reduction for the blunt body with spike and opposing jet is conducted. According to the simulation results obtained from the computational fluid dynamics, the relationship between input parameters and aerodynamic force/heat is established via the point-collocation non-intrusive polynomial chaos method. Uncertainties of pressure and heat flux caused by changes of input parameters are quantified. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine key parameters affecting pressure and heat flux changes. The results indicate that changes of peak pressure and peak heat flux are resulted from significant change in reattachment shock strength which varies with input parameters. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the length-to-diameter ratio has huge influence on the uncertainty in the recirculation zone, while the nozzle radius dominates the uncertainty in the reattachment zone. Moreover, it is found that the nozzle radius has an enormous effect on peak pressure and peak heat flux, and a significant negative correlation between them is identified.",

  "abstract": "Paleoclimate reconstruction relies on estimates of spatiotemporal relationships among climate quantities to interpolate between proxy data. This work quantifies how structural uncertainties in those relationships translate to uncertainties in reconstructions of past climate. We develop and apply a data assimilation uncertainty quantification approach to paleoclimate networks and observational uncertainties representative of data for the last millennium. We find that structural uncertainties arising from uncertain spatial covariance relationships typically contribute 10% of the total uncertainty in reconstructed temperature variability at small (∼200 km), continental, and hemispheric length scales, with larger errors (50% or larger) in regions where long-range climate covariances are least certain. These structural uncertainties contribute far more to errors in uncertainty quantification, sometimes by a factor of 5 or higher. Accounting for and reducing uncertainties in climate model dynamics and resulting covariance relationships will improve paleoclimate reconstruction accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Past planetary missions have been broad and detailed for Gas Giants, compared to flyby missions for Ice Giants. Presently, a mission to Neptune using electrodynamic tethers is under consideration due to the ability of tethers to provide free propulsion and power for orbital insertion as well as additional exploratory maneuvering - providing more mission capability than a standard orbiter mission. Tether operation depends on plasma density and magnetic field B, though tethers can deal with ill-defined density profiles, with the anodic segment self-adjusting to accommodate densities. Planetary magnetic fields are due to currents in some small volume inside the planet, magnetic-moment vector, and typically a dipole law approximation, which describes the field outside. When compared with Saturn and Jupiter, the Neptunian magnetic structure is significantly more complex: the dipole is located below the equatorial plane, is highly offset from the planet center, and at large tilt with its rotation axis. Lorentz-drag work decreases quickly with distance, thus requiring spacecraft periapsis at capture close to the planet and allowing the large offset to make capture efficiency (spacecraft-to-tether mass ratio) well above a no-offset case. The S/C might optimally reach periapsis when crossing the meridian plane of the dipole, with the S/C facing it; this convenient synchronism is eased by Neptune rotating little during capture. Calculations yield maximum efficiency of approximately 12, whereas a 10<SUP>∘</SUP> meridian error would reduce efficiency by about 6%. Efficiency results suggest new calculations should be made to fully include Neptunian rotation and consider detailed dipole and quadrupole corrections.",

  "abstract": "We investigated energy flow in the inner magnetosphere on the basis of the results obtained by a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation. When the magnetosphere is exposed to a southward interplanetary magnetic field, the magnetosphere undergoes quasi-steady convection. Downward (earthward) Poynting flux is found in the polar cap, which is consistent with previous observations. However, Poynting flux appears to be upward (antiearthward) in the equatorward region of the auroral oval. The Region 2 field-aligned current (FAC) is embedded in the upward Poynting flux region. The upward Poynting flux is closely associated with space charge deposited by the ionospheric Hall current under inhomogeneous ionospheric conductivity. The space charge gives rise to shear flow of plasma, which is transmitted upward to the magnetosphere. The shear flow generates additional Region 2 FAC, at least, in the low-altitude magnetosphere. Spatial distribution of the Region 2 FAC appears to depend on altitude, suggesting the significant influence of the ionosphere in the Region 2 FAC region. We traced integral curves of Poynting flux (S curves) backward from a magnetic field line in the Region 2 FAC region and found that the S curves originate either in the solar wind and in the earthward-most boundary of the simulation. These simulation results suggest that the ionosphere participates in the generation of the Region 2 FAC, and the ionosphere is a mediator to feed energy to the inner magnetosphere under the quasi-steady convection.",

  "abstract": "Forcings from above and below the ionosphere can cause disturbances that need to be detected and corrected for navigation systems. Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) are used to give corrections to aircraft navigation systems while landing. These systems use regional ionosphere monitoring algorithms to detect the anomalies in the ionosphere. The aim of this study is to understand occurrence of ionosphere anomalies and their trends over Turkey. A comprehensive analysis of spatio-temporal variability of ionosphere is carried out for a midlatitude GPS network using Slant Total Electron Content (STEC). Differential Rate Of TEC (DROT), which is a measure of the amount of deviation of temporal derivative of TEC from its trend, is used to detect and classify the level of such disturbances. The GPS satellite tracks are grouped into north, east, west and over directions. The 24 h is divided into six time intervals. The percentage occurrence of each DROT category and the deviation from STEC trend in magnitude are calculated and grouped into satellite track directions and time intervals for 2010 (low solar activity), 2011 and 2012 (medium solar activity). The highest level of disturbances is observed in north and west directions, and during sunrise and sunset hours. The dominant periods of percentage occurrences are diurnal (22-25 h), semidiurnal (12-13 h) and terdiurnal (8-9 h) followed by quasi two-day and quasi 16-day periods. Disturbances corresponding to 50% &lt; DROT &lt; 70% are mostly visible during low solar activity years with magnitudes from 1 to 2 TECU. Geomagnetic storms can cause aperiodic larger scale disturbances that are mostly correlated with DROT &gt; 70%. In 2012, the magnitude of such disturbances can reach 5 TECU. The anisotropic and dynamic nature of midlatitude ionosphere is reflected in the spatio-temporal and spectral distributions of DROT, and their percentage occurrences. This study serves a basis for future studies about development of a regional ionosphere monitoring for Turkey.",

  "abstract": "During northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), irregular magnetic perturbations were observed in the duskside aurora oval via Swarm satellites instead of large-scale Region 1/2 magnetic perturbations. By taking advantage of Swarm constellation measurements, and their conjugate observations with an all-sky imager on the ground, the features of the irregular magnetic perturbations were examined. Detailed analysis of the data from Swarm A and Swarm C for two events demonstrated that the irregular magnetic perturbations are a result of highly structured quasistatic field-aligned currents (FACs), not dynamic Alfvén waves. The typical latitudinal size of the upward FACs is 20-30 km. In each region of the upward FACs, 630-nm aurora emissions are relatively strong, indicating that the energy flux of precipitating electrons having energies of a few hundred electron volts is high in each of the upward FAC regions. The enhanced mesoscale auroras continued to exist for at least approximately 30 min. These indicate that the mesoscale FAC structures also have quasipersistent features. The precipitating particle data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite, which passed through the field of view of the all-sky imager, indicate that the source of the precipitating particles is the duskside low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL). We suggest that the highly structured quasipersistent FACs flow along the magnetic field lines connected to the duskside LLBL where cold dense ions exist. The highly structured FACs in the duskside aurora oval are the phenomena that are pertinent to the magnetosphere for a northward IMF condition, not a simple remnant of the typical Region 1.",

Currently, there is a lack of accurate and continuous SST prediction for this region due to the high cost of collecting the samples (e.g., cost of buoys, maintenance, severe weather). In this work, we use SST data from satellite images and in situ measurements collected by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to develop multifidelity forecasting models. This multifidelity framework is based on autoregressive Gaussian process schemes that systematically exploit all correlations between data from multiple heterogeneous spatiotemporal sources with various degrees of fidelity. This enables us to obtain implicitly their functional relationships and, at the same time, quantify the uncertainty of the data-driven predictions. Specifically, in the current work, we develop and validate progressively more complex models, including temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal multifidelity hindcast predictions of SST in the Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays. Together with these predictions, we present for the first time uncertainty maps for the region.",

The main results are as follows. (1) Simultaneous variations were detected in the ionospheric parameters from the E region to the topside ionosphere around the first peak warming of the 2017 SSW. (2) These variations exhibited similar quasi-16-day (Q16D; ~14.5-day) periods, and these periods were most significant just before the first peak warming. (3) These simultaneous Q16D variations were not due to the solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance or geomagnetic activities but were probably driven from below, by planetary waves or semidiurnal lunar tides that enhanced during the SSW. (4) The Q16D variation of the topside ionospheric electron density at ~830 km was probably driven not only by the upward mapping electric field modulated in the E region dynamo but also by the electric field modulated in the F region dynamo.",

In this work, we have assessed the effect of a dense ground network consisting of different radio instruments either developed or under developing on ionosphere nowcasting and forecasting over China and adjacent region (0-60°N and 70-140°E) through observing system simulation experiments. The data assimilation system is an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as a background model. Effects of different observation types, including the slant total electron content from Beidou System geostationary satellite and Global Position System and electron density observations from ionosondes and incoherent scattering radar on the ionospheric nowcasting and forecasting, are examined by the accurate specification of ionosphere key parameters (total electron content and 3-D electron density). We found that simultaneously assimilating different observation types can greatly improve the quality of ionosphere specification. Furthermore, updating the thermospheric state variables in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere forecast model in the assimilation step plays an important role in improving the ionosphere forecasting. The ionosphere forecasting capability can last longer (&gt;24 hr) in each observing system simulation experiment due to the adjusted thermosphere states. This study can provide a reference for observing system design over the China region and future ionosphere forecasting operation.",

  "abstract": "Studies show that intense lightning discharges can perturb nighttime lower ionosphere through induced electromagnetic fields. We report here new evidence that every lightning stroke, regardless of intensity, has an impact on both daytime and nighttime lower ionosphere. Through analysis of thousands of negative cloud-to-ground lightning strokes in southern China, we find that skywave features of a lightning sferic are closely related to its source intensity. Variations with increasing lightning intensity show a higher reflectivity from nighttime ionosphere but a larger time delay from daytime ionosphere. It also shows that the ionosphere recovers from the lightning impact in a time shorter than tens of milliseconds. This suggests that there exists a direct and fast nonlinear coupling between lightning-generated electromagnetic fields and lower ionosphere, making the ionospheric response to a lightning stroke dependent of the lightning intensity. A candidate mechanism for this is the Joule heating effect, but it needs future studies.",

  "abstract": "The importance of a national or regional network of meteorological stations for improving weather predictions has been recognized for many years. Ground-based automatic weather stations typically observe weather at a height of 2-10 m above ground level (AGL); however, these observations may have two major shortcomings. Large portions of data cannot be used if the station height is significantly lower than the model surface level; and such observations may contain large representativity errors as near-surface observations are often affected by the local environment, such as nearby buildings and tall trees. With the recent introduction of a significant number of mobile communication towers that are typically over 40 m AGL in China, a campaign has been proposed to use such towers to build a future observing system with an observing height of 40 m. A series of observing system simulation experiments has been conducted to assess the potential utility of such a future observing system as part of a feasibility study. The experiments were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and its Rapid Update Cycle data assimilation system. The results revealed the possibility of improving weather forecasting by raising present weather stations to a height of 40 m; this would not only enable more observations to pass the terrain check, but should also reduce interpolation errors. Additionally, improvements for temperature, humidity and wind forecasting could be achieved as the accuracy of the initial conditions increases.",
