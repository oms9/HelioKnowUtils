  "abstract": "The heating of the solar chromosphere and corona to the observed high temperatures, imply the presence of ongoing heating that balances the strong radiative and thermal conduction losses expected in the solar atmosphere. It has been theorized for decades that the required heating mechanisms of the chromospheric and coronal parts of the active regions, quiet-Sun, and coronal holes are associated with the solar magnetic fields. However, the exact physical process that transport and dissipate the magnetic energy which ultimately leads to the solar plasma heating are not yet fully understood. The current understanding of coronal heating relies on two main mechanism: reconnection and MHD waves that may have various degrees of importance in different coronal regions. In this review we focus on recent advances in our understanding of MHD wave heating mechanisms. First, we focus on giving an overview of observational results, where we show that different wave modes have been discovered in the corona in the last decade, many of which are associated with a significant energy flux, either generated in situ or pumped from the lower solar atmosphere. Afterwards, we summarise the recent findings of numerical modelling of waves, motivated by the observational results. Despite the advances, only 3D MHD models with Alfvén wave heating in an unstructured corona can explain the observed coronal temperatures compatible with the quiet Sun, while 3D MHD wave heating models including cross-field density structuring are not yet able to account for the heating of coronal loops in active regions to their observed temperature.",

  "abstract": "Space observations of the atmosphere of the Sun, obtained in half a century of dedicated space missions, provide a well established picture of the medium and large-scale solar corona, which is highly variable with the level of solar activity through a solar cycle and evolves with the long-term evolution of the magnetic cycles. In this review, we summarize the physical properties and dynamics of the medium and large-scale corona, consisting primarily of active regions, streamers and coronal holes; describe the dependence of coronal patterns on the magnetic field patterns changing through the solar cycle and the properties of the regions of open magnetic flux channeling the solar wind; the ubiquitous presence of fluctuations in the outer corona; the rotational properties of the large-scale corona; and the persistent hemispheric asymmetries in the emergence of magnetic fields and the distribution of the coronal emission.",

  "abstract": "Time-distance helioseismology is a set of powerful tools to study localized features below the Sun's surface. Inverse methods are needed to robustly interpret time-distance measurements, with many examples in the literature. However, techniques that utilize a more statistical approach to inferences, and that are broadly used in the astronomical community, are less-commonly found in helioseismology. This article aims to introduce a potentially powerful inversion scheme based on Bayesian probability theory and Monte Carlo sampling that is suitable for local helioseismology. We first describe the probabilistic method and how it is conceptually different from standard inversions used in local helioseismology. Several example calculations are carried out to compare and contrast the setup of the problems and the results that are obtained. The examples focus on two important phenomena that are currently outstanding issues in helioseismology: meridional circulation and supergranulation. Numerical models are used to compute synthetic observations, providing the added benefit of knowing the solution against which the results can be tested. For demonstration purposes, the problems are formulated in two and three dimensions, using both ray- and Born-theoretical approaches. The results seem to indicate that the probabilistic inversions not only find a better solution with much more realistic estimation of the uncertainties, but they also provide a broader view of the range of solutions possible for any given model, making the interpretation of the inversion more quantitative in nature. The probabilistic inversions are also easy to set up for a broad range of problems, and they can take advantage of software that is publicly available. Unlike the progress being made in fundamental measurement schemes in local helioseismology that image the far side of the Sun, or have detected signatures of global Rossby waves, among many others, inversions of those measurements have had significantly less success. Such statistical methods may help overcome some of these barriers to move the field forward.",

  "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections are large eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the low solar corona into the heliosphere. These eruptions are often associated with energetic electrons that produce various kinds of radio emission. However, there is ongoing investigation into exactly where, when and how the electron acceleration occurs during flaring and eruption, and how the associated radio emission can be exploited as a diagnostic of both the particle acceleration and CME eruptive physics. Here, we review past and present developments in radio observations of flaring and eruption, from the destabilisation of flux ropes to development of a CME and the eventual driving of shocks in the corona. We concentrate primarily on the progress made in CME radio physics in the past two decades, and show how radio imaging spectroscopy provides the ability to diagnose the locations and kinds of electron acceleration during eruption, which provides insight into CME eruptive models in the early stages of their evolution (&lt;10 Rsun). We finally discuss how new instrumentation in the radio domain will pave the way for a deeper understanding of CME physics in the near future.",

  "abstract": "We present an in-depth characterization of the polarimetric channel of the Large-Angle Spectrometric COronagraph/LASCO-C2 onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The polarimetric analysis of the white-light images makes use of polarized sequences composed of three images obtained though three polarizers oriented at +60<SUP>∘</SUP>, 0<SUP>∘</SUP>, and -60<SUP>∘</SUP>, complemented by a neighboring unpolarized image, and relies on the formalism of Mueller. The Mueller matrix characterizing the C2 instrument was obtained through extensive ground-based calibrations of the optical components and global laboratory tests. Additional critical corrections were derived from in-flight tests relying prominently on roll sequences of SOHO, on the basis of consistency criteria (e.g. the \"tangential\" direction of polarization), and from several applications, notably the time-dependent tomographic reconstruction of the coronal electron density. This took several years of effort, but resulted in the quasi-uninterrupted photopolarimetric analysis of the corona over two complete Solar Cycles 23 and 24, and the comparison with a variety of eclipse data obtained at different phases of these cycles. Our final results encompass the characterization of the polarization of the white-light corona, of its polarized radiance, of the two-dimensional electron density, and of the K-corona. The agreement with the eclipse data is excellent except for slight discrepancies affecting the innermost part of the C2 field of view. The present work leaves the two unpolarized components, F-corona and stray light, entangled and their complex separation will be dealt with in a follow-on article.",

  "abstract": "We compare Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of Jupiter during 2007 with a rich multi-instrument data set including upstream in situ solar wind measurements from the New Horizons spacecraft, radio emissions from the Nançay Decametric Array and Wind/Waves, and ultraviolet (UV) observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. New Horizons data revealed two corotating interaction regions (CIRs) impacted Jupiter during these observations. Non-Io decametric bursts and UV emissions brightened together and varied in phase with the CIRs. We characterize three types of X-ray aurorae: hard X-ray bremsstrahlung main emission, pulsed/flared soft X-ray emissions, and a newly identified dim flickering (varying on short time scales, but quasi-continuously present) aurora. For most observations, the X-ray aurorae were dominated by pulsed/flaring emissions, with ion spectral lines that were best fit by iogenic plasma. However, the brightest X-ray aurora was coincident with a magnetosphere expansion. For this observation, the aurorae were produced by both flickering emission and erratic pulses/flares. Auroral spectral models for this observation required the addition of solar wind ions to attain good fits, suggesting solar wind entry into the outer magnetosphere or directly into the pole for this particularly bright observation. X-ray bremsstrahlung from high energy electrons was only bright for one observation, which was during a forward shock. This bremsstrahlung was spatially coincident with bright UV main emission (power &gt; 1 TW) and X-ray ion spectral line dusk emission, suggesting closening of upward and downward current systems during the shock. Otherwise, the bremsstrahlung was dim, and UV main emission power was also lower (&lt;700 GW), suggesting their power scaled together.",

  "abstract": "Coronal rain corresponds to cool and dense clumps in the corona accreting towards the solar surface; it is often observed above solar active regions. These clumps are generally thought to be produced by a thermal instability in the corona and their lifetime is limited by the time they take to reach the chromosphere. Although the rain usually fragments into smaller clumps while falling down, their specific spatial and temporal scales remain unclear. In addition, the observational signatures of the impact of the rain with the chromosphere have not been clarified yet. In this study, we investigate the time evolution of the velocity and intensity of coronal rain above a sunspot by analyzing coronal images obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) as well as the slit-jaw images (SJIs) and spectral data taken by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) satellite. We identify dark and bright threads moving towards the umbra in AIA images and in SJIs, respectively, and co-spatial chromospheric intensity enhancements and redshifts in three IRIS spectral lines, Mg II k 2796 Å, Si IV 1394 Å, and C II 1336 Å. The intensity enhancements and coronal rain redshifts occur almost concurrently in all the three lines, which clearly demonstrates the causal relationship with coronal rain. Furthermore, we detect bursty intensity variation with a time scale shorter than 1 minute in Mg II k, Si IV, and C II, indicating that a length scale of rain clumps is about 2.7 Mm if we multiply the typical time scale of the busty intensity variation at 30 sec by the rain velocity at 90 kms-<SUP>1</SUP>. Such rapid enhancements in the IRIS lines are excited within a time lag of 5.6 sec limited by the temporal resolution. These temporal and spatial scales may reflect the physical processes responsible for the rain morphology, and are suggestive of instabilities such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.",

  "abstract": "Solar radio emission has been providing information about the Sun for over half a century. In order to fully exploit this information, one needs to have a broader view of the solar atmosphere, which cannot be provided by radio observations alone. The purpose of this review is to present this background information, which is necessary to understand the physical processes that determine the solar radio emission and to link the radio domain with the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. <P />Both classic and modern results are presented in a concise manner. After a brief discussion of the solar interior, the basic physics of the solar atmosphere and some elements of radiative transfer are presented. Subsequently the atmospheric structure as a function of height is examined and one -dimensional models of the photosphere, the chromosphere, the transition region and the corona are presented and discussed. An introduction to basic magnetohydrodynamics precedes the discussion of the rich fine structure of the solar atmosphere as a 3D object. Active regions are briefly discussed in a separate section, and this is followed by a section on the problem of heating of the chromosphere and the corona. I finish with some thoughts on what to expect from the new instruments currently under development.",

  "abstract": "Previous Juno mission event studies revealed powerful electron and ion acceleration, to 100s of kiloelectron volts and higher, at low altitudes over Jupiter's main aurora and polar cap (PC; poleward of the main aurora). Here we examine 30-1200 keV JEDI-instrument particle data from the first 16 Juno orbits to determine how common, persistent, repeatable, and ordered these processes are. For the PC regions, we find (1) upward electron angle beams, sometimes extending to megaelectron volt energies, are persistently present in essentially all portions of the polar cap but are generated by two distinct and spatially separable processes. (2) Particle evidence for megavolt downward electrostatic potentials are observable for 80% of the polar cap crossings and over substantial fractions of the PC area. For the main aurora, with the orbit favoring the duskside, we find that (1) three distinct zones are observed that are generally arranged from lower to higher latitudes but sometimes mixed. They are designated here as the diffuse aurora (DifA), Zone-I (ZI(D)) showing primarily downward electron acceleration, and Zone-II (ZII(B)) showing bidirectional acceleration with the upward intensities often greater than downward intensities. (2) ZI(D) and ZII(B) sometimes (but not always) contain, respectively, downward electron inverted Vs and downward proton inverted Vs, (potentials up to 400 kV) but, otherwise, have broadband distributions. (3) Surprisingly, both ZI(D) and ZII(B) can generate equally powerful auroral emissions. It is suggested but demonstrated for intense portions of only one auroral crossing, that ZI(D) and ZII(B) are associated, respectively, with upward and downward electric currents.",

  "abstract": "Predicting the large-scale eruptions from the solar corona and their propagation through interplanetary space remains an outstanding challenge in solar- and helio-physics research. In this article, we describe three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the inner heliosphere leading up to and including the extreme interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) of 23 July 2012, developed using the code PLUTO. The simulations are driven using the output of coronal models for Carrington rotations 2125 and 2126 and, given the uncertainties in the initial conditions, are able to reproduce an event of comparable magnitude to the 23 July ICME, with similar velocity and density profiles at 1 au. The launch time of this event is then varied with regards to an initial 19 July ICME and the effects of solar wind preconditioning are found to be significant for an event of this magnitude and to decrease over a time-window consistent with the ballistic refilling of the depleted heliospheric sector. These results indicate that the 23 July ICME was mostly unaffected by events prior, but would have traveled even faster had it erupted closer in time to the 19 July event where it would have experienced even lower drag forces. We discuss this systematic study of solar wind preconditioning in the context of space weather forecasting.",

  "abstract": "The solar wind prediction is based on the Wang and Sheeley (Astrophys. J.365, 372, 1990) empirical relationship between the solar wind speed observed at 1 AU and the rate of magnetic flux tube expansion (FTE) between the photosphere and the inner corona, where the FTE is computed using coronal models (e.g. the current sheet source surface (CSSS) and the potential field source surface models). These models take the photospheric flux density synoptic maps as their inner boundary conditions to extrapolate the photospheric magnetic fields and to deduce the coronal and the heliospheric magnetic field configuration. These synoptic maps are among the most widely-used of all solar magnetic data products and therefore, the uncertainties in the model predictions that are caused by the uncertainties in the synoptic maps are worthy of study. However, an estimate of the uncertainties in the construction of these synoptic maps was not available until recently when Bertello et al.

For each photospheric synoptic map, they obtained 98 Monte Carlo realizations of the spatial standard deviation maps.",

In June 2018, a global dust storm (GDS) surrounded Mars for a few months, heating the lower atmosphere and leading to an expansion of the Martian atmosphere. Nightside IUVS observations before and throughout this GDS showed the altitude of CO<SUB>2</SUB> absorption of Lyman-α photons in the thermosphere to increase by 4.5±1.0 km on 8 June 2018. This shift is attributed to an increase of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> density by a factor 1.9±0.2 at 110 km due to the heating of the lower atmosphere. These nightside observations, not previously used to study dust storms, in an altitude range not sampled by other instruments, are consistent with dayside MAVEN observations and allow for more comprehensive determination of the global changes produced by the GDS on the Martian thermosphere.",

  "abstract": "We report the temporal and spectral results of the first XMM-Newton observation of Jupiter's X-ray auroras during a clear magnetospheric compression event on June 2017 as confirmed by data from the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) instrument onboard Juno. The northern and southern auroras were visible twice and thrice respectively as they rotated in and out of view during the ∼23-hr (almost 2.5 Jupiter rotations) long XMM-Newton Jovian-observing campaign. Previous auroral observations by Chandra and XMM-Newton have shown that the X-ray auroras sometimes pulse with a regular period. We applied wavelet and fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on the auroral light curves to show that, following the compression event, the X-ray auroras exhibited a recurring 23- to 27-min periodicity that lasted over 12.5 hr (longer than a Jupiter rotation). This periodicity was observed from both the northern and southern auroras, suggesting that the emission from both poles was caused by a shared driver. The soft X-ray component of the auroras is due to charge exchange processes between precipitating ions and neutrals in Jupiter's atmosphere. We utilized the Atomic Charge Exchange (ACX) spectral package to produce solar wind and iogenic plasma models to fit the auroral spectra in order to identify the origins of these ions. For this observation, the iogenic model gave the best fit, which suggests that the precipitating ions are from iogenic plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "We present observations of Jupiter's magnetic field and plasma obtained with the NASA Juno spacecraft during February 2018, along with simultaneous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the planet's auroras. We show that a few-day transient enhancement of the azimuthal and radial magnetic fields and plasma temperature was coincident with a significant brightening of Jupiter's dawn-side main auroral emission. This presents the first evidence of control of Jupiter's main auroral emission intensity by magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents. We support this association by self-consistent calculation of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and radial force balance currents using an axisymmetric model, which broadly reproduces the Juno magnetic field and plasma observations and the HST auroral observations. We show that the transient enhancement can be explained by increased hot plasma pressure in the magnetosphere together with increased iogenic plasma mass outflow rate. Overall, this work provides important observational and modeling evidence revealing the behavior of Jupiter's giant magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "Explosive magnetotail activity has long been understood in the context of its auroral manifestations. While global models have been used to interpret and understand many magnetospheric processes, the temporal and spatial scales of some auroral forms have been inaccessible to global modeling creating a gulf between observational and theoretical studies of these phenomena. We present here an important step toward bridging this gulf using a newly developed global magnetosphere-ionosphere model with resolution capturing ≲ 30 km azimuthal scales in the auroral zone. In a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the growth phase of a synthetic substorm, we find the self-consistent formation and destabilization of localized magnetic field minima in the near-Earth magnetotail. We demonstrate that this destabilization is due to ballooning-interchange instability which drives earthward entropy bubbles with embedded magnetic fronts. Finally, we show that these bubbles create localized field-aligned current structures that manifest in the ionosphere with properties matching observed auroral beads.",

  "abstract": "Total solar eclipse (TSE) coronal large- and small-scale events were reported in the historical literature but a definite synoptic coverage was missing for studying a relationship with the more general magnetic context of the solar-disk. We here analyze temporal changes in the solar corona before, during, and after the total solar eclipse on 21 August 2017 from a set of ground-based and of space-borne observations. High-quality ground-based white-light (W-L) observations and a deep image processing allow us to reveal these changes for the first time with a fraction of a minute temporal resolution. Displacements of a number of fine coronal features were measured for the first time at these small radial distances, using a diffraction-limited instrument at a single site. The comparison with space-based observations, including observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission, showed that the features belong to a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) propagating through the corona with the nearly constant speed of 250 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our TSE images provide the same typical velocity as measured at a distance of one solar radius from the surface. The event was initiated by coronal dynamics manifested by a prominence eruption that started just before the eclipse observations and an ascent of a U-shaped structure visible in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171 Å channel, which we assume as the lower part of a coronal cavity. The prominence material was observed draining down towards the chromosphere along the prominence arch. While the prominence disappears in the STEREO-A field-of-view at the height of about 6' above the limb, the corresponding flux rope seems to continue towards the outer corona and produces the slow CME with turbulent motion. The overall mass of the moving features is evaluated based on absolute photometrical data extracted from our best W-L eclipse image.",

  "abstract": "An extensive analysis of Cassini Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) and Charge Energy Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) measurements of ~6-231 keV ion anisotropies acquired during selected spin and stare periods for nearly all mission orbits has been completed. Based on this analysis, we find that the computed azimuthal speed of Saturn's magnetodisk plasma increases within the inner and middle magnetosphere. Beyond the orbit of Titan, in the magnetotail, the calculated rotation speed remains roughly constant with increasing distance from Saturn. The component of convection parallel to Saturn's spin axis is smaller and on average nearly zero. The radial speed of plasma shows distinct local time dependence and increases outward with increasing distance down the magnetotail. The magnetodisk flow remains primarily azimuthal to large distances, indicating the plasma is still under the influence of Saturn as it transits across the nightside. Tailward flows have been observed in the region near the dawn and dusk magnetotail flanks. The plasma flow in the predawn quadrant is much more disorganized than that in the premidnight quadrant. The hydrogen and oxygen hot ion temperatures increase with decreasing distance to Saturn. Some plasma evidently escapes into a dusk boundary layer at the dusk magnetotail flank, while the remaining plasma primarily moves across the magnetotail and is entrained into the flow of a boundary layer at the dawn flank of the magnetotail. When scaled to the magnetopause standoff distance and corotation fraction, the convection speed of plasma in the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn is similarly organized.",

The importance of kinetic plasma processes to these interactions has not been examined in detail, due to a lack of constraining observations. In this study, kinetic-scale electric field structures are identified in the Venusian magnetosheath, including plasma double layers. The double layers may be driven by currents or mixing of inhomogeneous plasmas near the edge of the magnetosheath. Estimated double-layer spatial scales are consistent with those reported at Earth. Estimated potential drops are similar to electron temperature gradients across the bow shock. Many double layers are found in few high cadence data captures, suggesting that their amplitudes are high relative to other magnetosheath plasma waves. These are the first direct observations of plasma double layers beyond near-Earth space, supporting the idea that kinetic plasma processes are active in many space plasma environments.",

  "abstract": "We estimate the role of heat flux from hot magnetic loops and open flux tubes into the surrounding corona as a possible source of heating of the corona. We show that hot magnetic-flux tubes (Type-II spicules) provide a more efficient source of coronal heating than hot magnetic loops, as the closed magnetic structure of a loop substantially restricts the heat flux into the corona. In order to compensate for radiation and thermal-conduction losses, approximately 10<SUP>4</SUP> Type-II spicules with a temperature of several million Kelvin are required, which is about 1% of the number of spicules simultaneously observed on the solar disk. Our analysis shows that the principal source of energy that heats the coronal plasma is photospheric convection, which generates electric currents of about 10<SUP>10</SUP> - 10<SUP>12</SUP> A in magnetic loops and spicules. Dissipation of the currents increases significantly in the partially ionized plasma, i.e. when ion-atom collisions and the associated Cowling conductivity occur. This results in two important effects: heating of plasma in magnetic structures up to several million Kelvin, and ejection of hot plasma from open magnetic-flux tubes to the corona, replenishing the corona with hot plasma. The ejection of hot plasma results from the heating of the spicule foot-point by electric-current dissipation, which grows with a sporadic increase in the velocity of photospheric convection, for example, due to five-minute oscillations or the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. As a result, the rate of heating the photospheric foot-points of the spicules by ring currents exceeds radiation losses, which leads to a jump in the pressure gradient and the ejection of hot plasma into the corona from the open tips of the magnetic-flux tubes.",

We use multispectral images collected with the Ultraviolet Spectral (UVS) imager on board Juno to estimate the two-dimensional distribution of the electron energy flux and characteristic energy. These values are fed to an ionospheric model describing the generation and loss of different ion species, to calculate the auroral Pedersen conductivity.

  "abstract": "Jupiter's upper atmosphere is ∼700 K hotter than predicted based on solar extreme ultraviolet heating alone. The reason for this still remains a mystery and is known as the \"energy crisis.\" It is thought that the interaction between Jupiter and its dynamic magnetosphere plays a vital role in heating its atmosphere to the observed temperatures. Here, we present a new model of Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere-coupled system where we couple a three-dimensional atmospheric general circulation model to an axisymmetric magnetosphere model. We find that the model temperatures are on average ∼60 K, with a maximum of ∼200 K, hotter than the model's two-dimensional predecessor making our high-latitude temperatures comparable to the lower limit of observations. Stronger meridional winds now transport more heat from the auroral region to the equator increasing the equatorial temperatures. However, despite this increase, the modeled equatorial temperatures are still hundreds of kelvins colder than observed. We use this model as an intermediate step toward a three-dimensional atmospheric model coupled to a realistic magnetosphere model with zonal and radial variation.",

  "abstract": "This paper reviews our current understanding of auroral features that appear poleward of the main auroral oval within the polar cap, especially those that are known as Sun-aligned arcs, transpolar arcs, or theta auroras. They tend to appear predominantly during periods of quiet geomagnetic activity or northwards directed interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We also introduce polar rain aurora which has been considered as a phenomenon on open field lines. We describe the morphology of such auroras, their development and dynamics in response to solar wind-magnetosphere coupling processes, and the models that have been developed to explain them.",

  "abstract": "As an important proxy of the solar extreme ultraviolet radiation from the upper chromosphere and lower corona, the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7) has a wide range of applications in models of the thermosphere and ionosphere. Forecasting F10.7 has already become a routine business in space weather services. In this study, we analyzed the predictive power of autoregressive (AR) models with orders p =15 - 1005, a training sample length L =22 years, and a running time window w =50 days on the daily F10.7, during the last two solar cycles (Solar Cycles 23 and 24) at the forecast steps n =1 - 81 days. The main conclusions are as follows. (i) The mean forecast error (δ ‾) at the n th day or over N days is minimum at an optimal order p<SUB>o</SUB>, which tends to increase as n or N increases. (ii) δ ‾ is positively related to both n and F10.7. The large error during the maximum period is the result of the large daily variation in F10.7, mainly due to the appearance and decay of active regions, especially the eruptions of solar flares. (iii) The solar cycle can be divided into six parts in the rising order of δ ‾: (a) closing part of the declining phase, (b) initial rising phase, (c) middle declining phase, (iv) closing rising phase, (v) middle rising phase, and (f) initial declining phase. (iv) The AR model at p<SUB>o</SUB> is not inferior to other techniques. (v) p<SUB>o</SUB> is uncorrelated to the autocorrelation coefficient, and (vi) δ ‾ is minimum at a certain L.",

  "abstract": "Solar activity, ranging from the background solar wind to energetic coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is the main driver of the conditions in the interplanetary space and in the terrestrial space environment, known as space weather. A better understanding of the Sun-Earth connection carries enormous potential to mitigate negative space weather effects with economic and social benefits. Effective space weather forecasting relies on data and models. In this paper, we discuss some of the most used space weather models, and propose suitable locations for data gathering with space weather purposes. We report on the application of Representer analysis (RA) and Domain of Influence (DOI) analysis to three models simulating different stages of the Sun-Earth connection: the OpenGGCM and Tsyganenko models, focusing on solar wind - magnetosphere interaction, and the PLUTO model, used to simulate CME propagation in interplanetary space. Our analysis is promising for space weather purposes for several reasons. First, we obtain quantitative information about the most useful locations of observation points, such as solar wind monitors. For example, we find that the absolute values of the DOI are extremely low in the magnetospheric plasma sheet. Since knowledge of that particular sub-system is crucial for space weather, enhanced monitoring of the region would be most beneficial. Second, we are able to better characterize the models. Although the current analysis focuses on spatial rather than temporal correlations, we find that time-independent models are less useful for Data Assimilation activities than time-dependent models. Third, we take the first steps towards the ambitious goal of identifying the most relevant heliospheric parameters for modelling CME propagation in the heliosphere, their arrival time, and their geoeffectiveness at Earth.",

  "abstract": "Discontinuities in the solar wind, bow shock ripples or ionized dust clouds carried by the solar wind, high speed jets (HSJs) are observed in the magnetosheath. These HSJs have typically a Vx component larger than 200 km s-1 and their dynamic pressure can be a few times the solar wind dynamic pressure. We use a conjunction of Cluster and MMS, crossing simultaneously the magnetopause, to study the characteristics of these HSJs and their impact on the magnetopause. Over one hour-fifteen minutes interval in the magnetosheath, Cluster observed 21 HSJs. During the same period, MMS observed 12 HSJs and entered the magnetosphere several times. A jet was observed simultaneously by both MMS and Cluster and it is very likely that they were two distinct HSJs. TDuring this period, two and six magnetopause crossings were observed respectively on Cluster and MMS with a significant angle between the observation and the expected normal deduced from models. The angles observed range between from 11° up to 114°. One inbound magnetopause crossing observed by Cluster (magnetopause moving out at 142 km s-1) was observed simultaneous to an outbound magnetopause crossing observed by MMS (magnetopause moving in at -83 km s-1), showing that the magnetopause can have multiple local indentation places, most likely independent from each other. Under the continuous impacts of HSJs, the magnetopause is deformed significantly and can even move in opposite directions at different places. It can therefore not be considered as a smooth surface anymore but more as surface full of local indents. Four dust impacts were observed on MMS, although not at the time when HSJs are observed, showing that dust clouds would have been present during the observations. No dust cloud in the form of Interplanetary Field Enhancements was however observed in the solar wind which may exclude large clouds of dust as a cause of HSJs. Radial IMF and Alfven Mach number above 10 would fulfil the criteria for the creation of bow shock ripples and the subsequent crossing of HSJs in the magnetosheath.",

We briefly discuss the connection between single and multiple discrete arcs. The acceleration of the magnetospheric electrons by high-altitude electric potential structure is reviewed, together with our current knowledge of these structures. Observations relating to the potential drop, altitude distribution and lifetimes are reviewed, as well as direct evidence for the parallel electric fields of the acceleration structures. The current closure in the ionosphere of the currents carried by the auroral electrons is discussed together with its impact on the ionosphere and thermosphere. The connection of auroral arcs to the magnetosphere and generator regions is briefly touched upon. Finally we discuss how to progress from the current observational status to further our understanding of auroral arcs.",

  "abstract": "Based on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) observations, we have analyzed the role of the crustal magnetic field on ion loss driven by the direct interaction of the solar wind with the Mars ionosphere. Crustal magnetic fields significantly attenuate the ion ionospheric motions and raise the flux of returning ions. On the other hand, since the ion densities in the ionosphere with strong crustal field are significantly higher than in the ionosphere with a weak crustal magnetic field, the net escape fluxes from the ionosphere with the crustal sources remain vital. The crustal magnetic field also leads to the expansion of the ionosphere and increase of the area exposed to solar wind. As a result, fluxes from higher altitudes essentially contribute to the flow pattern in Martian tail producing an excess of ion loss rate (∼15%) through the southern part of the tail. Thus, effects of inhibition and enhancement of the escape rate by the crustal magnetic field at Mars operate in competition producing a minor influence on the total ion loss.",

Our study is conducted by utilizing our integrated model framework, which couples our Martian hot O corona model with a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model for Mars for the dusty and clear atmospheric condition cases. We present our results with the most up-to-date cross sections for the O(<SUP>3</SUP>P)-CO<SUB>2</SUB> collisions. The main effect of dust storms on the ionosphere is the upward shift of the ionosphere on the dayside, which results in an increase in production of hot O at all altitudes above the ionospheric peak. However, the dust-induced inflation of the neutral upper atmosphere results in an enhancement in collisional loss of hot O and thus effectively suppresses the hot O density, reducing the global photochemical loss rate by ~28% for the global dust storm scenario. The relative density structure of the hot O corona does not show any significant changes, while its magnitude decreases at all altitudes.",

  "abstract": "Mars regional and global dust storms are able to impact the lower/upper atmospheres through dust aerosol radiative heating and cooling and atmospheric circulation. Here we present the first attempt to globally investigate how the dust impact transfers from the neutral upper atmosphere to the ionosphere and the induced magnetosphere above 100-km altitude. This is achieved by running a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model under nondusty and dusty atmospheric conditions for the 2017 late-winter regional storm and the 1971-1972 global storm. Our results show that the dayside main ionospheric layer (below ∼250-km altitude) undergoes an overall upwelling, where photochemical reactions dominate. The peak electron density remains unchanged, and the peak altitude shift is in accordance with the upper atmospheric expansion (∼5 and ∼15 km for the regional and global storms, respectively). Controlled by the day-to-night transport, the nightside ionosphere responds to the dust storms in a close connection with what happens on the dayside but not apparently with the ambient atmospheric change. At higher altitudes, dust-induced perturbations propagate upward from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere and extend from the dayside to the nightside, within a broad region bounded by the induced magnetospheric boundary. It is found that the global dust storm is able to dramatically enhance the CO<SUP>2+</SUP> loss by a factor of ∼3, which amounts to an increase of ∼20% or more for total carbon loss (in the forms of neutrals and ions). Strong dust storms are a potentially important factor in atmospheric evolution at Mars.",

  "abstract": "We discuss, in a limited way, some of the challenges to advancing our understanding and description of the coupled plasma and neutral gas that make up the ionosphere and thermosphere (I-T). The I-T is strongly influenced by wave motions of the neutral atmosphere from the lower atmosphere and is coupled to the magnetosphere, which supplies energetic particle precipitation and field-aligned currents at high latitudes. The resulting plasma dynamics are associated with currents generated by solar heating and upward propagating waves, by heating from energetic particles and electromagnetic energy from the magnetosphere and by the closure of the field-aligned currents applied at high latitudes. These three contributors to the current are functions of position, magnetic activity, and other variables that must be unraveled to understand how the I-T responds to coupling from the surrounding regions of geospace. We have captured the challenges to this understanding in four major themes associated with coupling to the lower atmosphere, the generation and flow of currents within the I-T region, the coupling to the magnetosphere, and the response of the I-T region reflected in the neutral and plasma density changes. Addressing these challenges requires advances in observing the neutral density, composition, and velocity and simultaneous observations of the plasma density and motions as well as the particles and field-aligned current describing the magnetospheric energy inputs. Additionally, our modeling capability must advance to include better descriptions of the processes affecting the I-T region and incorporate coupling to below and above at smaller spatial and temporal scales.",

It is shown that the wideness of the tube leads to a new cutoff frequency, which is a local quantity that gives the conditions for the wave propagation at different atmospheric heights. The cutoff is used to establish the ranges of frequencies for the propagating and reflected waves in the solar chromosphere and lower solar corona. The obtained results are compared to those previously obtained for thin magnetic flux tubes and the differences are discussed. Moreover, the results are also compared to some current observational data, and used to establish the presence of propagating waves in the data at different atmospheric heights; this has profound implications on the energy and momentum transfer by the waves in the solar atmosphere, and the role of linear torsional Alfvén waves in the atmospheric heating and wind acceleration.",

  "abstract": "The accuracy of data-driven magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models depends on accurate boundary conditions specified at the inner heliosphere. However, not all of the MHD parameters [B ,v ,ρ ,T ] are measurable close to the Sun at the present time, except the vector magnetic field [B ] at the photosphere. The solar wind speed [v ], which is probably most relevant to space-weather forecasting, is often modeled by the standard Wang-Sheeley (WS) formula, which is based on an inverse relationship between the solar wind speed [v ] at 1 AU and the expansion factor [f<SUB>s</SUB>] estimated at 2.5 solar radii [R⊙], with the following generic form: v =v<SUB>1</SUB>+v<SUB>2</SUB>f<SUB>s-α</SUB> (where v is the solar wind speed at 18 R⊙, f<SUB>s</SUB> is the magnetic-field expansion factor, and v<SUB>1</SUB>, v<SUB>2</SUB>, and α are three free parameters to be determined). While the WS formula uses \"source projection\" to determine the solar wind source, it does not treat the solar wind as plasma because it uses the solar wind speed observed at 1 AU to derive the empirical relationship. Thus, the resulting formula ignores the transport and acceleration of the solar wind as it propagates out into the heliosphere. The purpose of this study is to rectify this omission by using a numerical MHD simulation to find the optimal set of free parameters that relate the magnetic properties at the source surface to the plasma parameters at 1 AU. In addition to the expansion factor, conservation of mass [ρ v ], magnetic flux [r<SUP>2</SUP>B ], and total pressure along the stream line are assumed to obtain the solar wind mass density, magnetic field, and temperature at 18 R⊙. These parameters are used as the inner boundary conditions of our global three-dimensional MHD (G3DMHD) code to simulate solar wind plasma and field parameters out to ≈1 AU. The simulation results are compared with the in-situ data from Wind to assess the accuracy. Such a procedure is repeated (880 times) to cover the three parameter regimes (100 &lt;v<SUB>1</SUB>&lt;350kms-<SUP>1</SUP>; 250 &lt;v<SUB>2</SUB>&lt;700 kms-<SUP>1</SUP>; and 0.2 &lt;α &lt;0.9 ) to find the optimal set. The simulation is performed for the period of CR2082 [30 March 2019 to 27 April 2009]. It is found that v =189 +679 f<SUB>s-0.7</SUB> is the best formula to relate the solar wind speed at 18 <SUB>R⊙</SUB> to the expansion factor. Strictly speaking, this formula is most applicable for solar equatorial regions and near the times of solar minimum when there are few coronal mass ejection events.",

  "abstract": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based radio positioning system which is capable of providing continuous position, velocity and time information to users anywhere on, or near, the surface of the Earth. The positional accuracy of GPS is limited by several sources of error, such as satellite and receiver clock offsets, signal propagation delays (due to the ionosphere and troposphere), multipath, receiver measurement noise, and instrument bias. The ionospheric delay is the predominant error source. The main objective of this work was to estimate the regional vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC) densities, using a linear combination of L1 and L2 carrier phase for higher order time delays at different thin-shell layers of the ionosphere (i.e. 60 km, 90 km, 150 km, 200 km and 450 km) over GPS stations in Ethiopia. Due to the high equatorial ionization anomaly and irregularity of the electron density distribution, we selected four GPS stations across the country. We studied longitudinal, latitudinal, and altitudinal variations in the ionosphere using GPS observables extracted by precise geodetic GAMIT-GLOBK software package. We obtained data from the 2013 to 2015 period for all stations. For daily data processing in GAMIT, we switched the International Geomagnetic Reference Field 2012 (IGRF-12) model (which consists of spherical harmonic coefficients) on and off, representing the Earth's main field and its secular variation and ionospheric electron content along the signal path (available from the Centre for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE)). Our results confirmed that there is latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal variation in the ionosphere. The density of total electron content and GPS positional error due to higher-order time delays have a positive correlation (more than 95%). The positional error, due to the higher order ionospheric delay, exceeds 4 mm for all GPS stations and reached up to 8 mm. Finally, we observed that the time delay due to the higher-order ionospheric effect in the L2 signal is twice that in the L1. We conclude that the GPS signal is affected by the higher order ionospheric delay by up to several centimetres due to its electron content and the Earth's magnetic field.",

  "abstract": "When a magnetosheath jet (localized dynamic pressure enhancements) compresses ambient magnetosheath at a (relative) speed faster than the local magnetosonic speed, a bow wave or shock can form ahead of the jet. Such bow waves or shocks were recently observed to accelerate particles, thus contributing to magnetosheath heating and particle acceleration in the extended environment of Earth's bow shock. To further understand the characteristics of jet-driven bow waves, we perform a statistical study to examine which solar wind conditions favor their formation and whether it is common for them to accelerate particles. We identified 364 out of 2,859 (~13%) magnetosheath jets to have a bow wave or shock ahead of them with Mach number typically larger than 1.1. We show that large solar wind plasma beta, weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, large solar wind Alfvén Mach number, and strong solar wind dynamic pressure present favorable conditions for their formation. We also show that magnetosheath jets with bow waves or shocks are more frequently associated with higher maximum ion and electron energies than those without them, confirming that it is common for these structures to accelerate particles. In particular, magnetosheath jets with bow waves have electron energy flux enhanced on average by a factor of 2 compared to both those without bow waves and the ambient magnetosheath. Our study implies that magnetosheath jets can contribute to shock acceleration of particles especially for high Mach number shocks. Therefore, shock models should be generalized to include magnetosheath jets and concomitant particle acceleration.",

  "abstract": "This paper evaluates the role of magnetic reconnection in the dayside ionosphere of Mars in the collisional regime and presents some relevant data from the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) mission. Magnetic reconnection is an important process operating in the solar corona, planetary magnetospheres, and astrophysical plasmas, but most of the literature focuses on collisionless plasmas. However, at Mars the reconnection should often occur in regions where collisions are important. Mars does not have a large-scale global magnetic field; however, Mars has locally large magnetic fields associated with remnant crustal magnetization, particularly in the highland regions of the southern hemisphere. The crustal fields provide a \"target\" for reconnection both in the ionosphere and in the magnetotail of Mars. The current paper emphasizes the dayside ionosphere. Magnetic reconnection is associated with topological changes in the magnetic field and is also a source of energy for the plasma and can thus affect the ionospheric dynamics and ion loss at Mars. Both theoretical concepts and MAVEN particle and field data from several instruments are considered in this paper.",

  "abstract": "The Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter for the past 3 years. During this interval, Juno has collected large datasets of plasma, magnetic field, and wave measurements in Jupiter's magnetosphere. In this study, we conduct statistics on the plasma and wave characteristics in Jupiter's magnetodisk (nightside magnetosphere beyond 20 Jupiter radii, R<SUB>J</SUB>). Distributions of electron fluxes and waves in the magnetodisk exhibit different characteristics in two regions: the plasma sheet with dense plasma and weak wave intensity and the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) occupied by strong waves and rarefied plasma. We discuss that these waves can be generated by field-aligned high-energy electrons in the PSBL. We further compare plasma and wave properties in the PSBL of Jupiter's magnetodisk with the PSBL in Earth's magnetotail. This comparison suggests that the PSBL in Jupiter's magnetodisk may be formed by transient magnetic reconnection in the Jovian magnetosphere. The dawn-dusk asymmetry of the PSBL properties further supports this scenario: the PSBL is more pronounced in the dawn flank of Jupiter's magnetodisk, where magnetic reconnection is predicted to occur by models of the rotation-dominated magnetosphere. We further discuss properties of the Jovian PSBL and implications on magnetic reconnection in Jupiter's magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "Magnetosheath jets are plasma entities that feature a significantly enhanced dynamic pressure with respect to the ambient plasma. They occur more often downstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock. Jets can propagate through the entire magnetosheath and impact on the magnetopause. We reanalyze multi-spacecraft data from the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission to obtain the first unbiased distributions of scale sizes of the jets, in the directions parallel and perpendicular to their propagation direction. These distributions are log-normal; they fit well to the observations. We argue that jet scales should be log-normally distributed as they should result from multiplicative processes in the foreshock and in the magnetosheath. We find that typical jet scales are on the order of 0.1 Earth radii (R<SUB>E</SUB>), one order of magnitude smaller than previously reported. Median scale sizes of 0.12 R<SUB>E</SUB> and 0.15 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the perpendicular and parallel directions are obtained. The small scales may be related to the substructure of Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) in the foreshock, or to the break up of larger jets within the magnetosheath. Use of the log-normal distributions also allows for an analysis of impact rates of small-scale jets: While previous results on large jets hitting the magnetopause several times per hour remain largely unchanged, we now find that hundreds to thousands of mostly small-scale jets could potentially impact the dayside magnetopause every hour.",

In this study, we examine the formation and evolution of the large-scale magnetic field in the Venus ionosphere using a sophisticated global multispecies Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model that has been developed for Venus (Ma et al., 2013, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JA018265\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JA018265</A>). A time-dependent model run is performed under varying solar wind dynamic pressure. Based on model results, we find that (1) the initial response of the induced magnetosphere is fast (~min), (2) a large-scale magnetic field gradually forms in the ionosphere when the solar wind dynamic pressure suddenly exceeds the ionospheric thermal pressure, (3) both the penetration and decay of the large-scale magnetic field in the ionosphere are slow (~hr), and (4) the ion escape rate has a nonlinear response to the change of solar wind dynamic pressure.",

  "abstract": "To understand magnetosphere-ionosphere conditions that result in thermal emission velocity enhancement (STEVE) and subauroral ion drifts (SAID) during the substorm recovery phase, we present substorm aurora, particle injection, and current systems during two STEVE events. Those events are compared to substorm events with similar strength but without STEVE. We found that the substorm surge and intense upward currents for the events with STEVE reach the dusk, while those for the non-STEVE substorms are localized around midnight. The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite observations show that location of particle injection and fast plasma sheet flows for the STEVE events also shifts duskward. Electron injection is stronger and ion injection is weaker for the STEVE events compared to the non-STEVE events. SAID are measured by Super Dual Auroral Radar Network during the STEVE events, but the non-STEVE events only showed latitudinally wide subauroral polarization streams without SAID. To interpret the observations, Rice Convection Model (RCM) simulations with injection at premidnight and midnight have been conducted. The simulations successfully explain the stronger electron injection, weaker ion injection, and formation of SAID for injection at premidnight, because injected electrons reach the premidnight inner magnetosphere and form a narrower separation between the ion and electron inner boundaries. We suggest that substorms and particle injections extending far duskward away from midnight offer a condition for creating STEVE and SAID due to stronger electron injection to premidnight. The THEMIS all-sky imager network identified the east-west length of the STEVE arc to be ~1900 km (~2.5 h magnetic local time) and the duration to be 1-1.5 h.",

  "abstract": "The solar wind in the inner heliosheath beyond the termination shock (TS) is a nonequilibrium collisionless plasma consisting of thermal solar wind ions, suprathermal pickup ions, and electrons. In such multi-ion plasma, two fast magnetosonic wave modes exist, the low-frequency fast mode and the high-frequency fast mode. Both fast modes are dispersive on fluid and ion scales, which results in nonlinear dispersive shock waves. We present high-resolution three-fluid simulations of the TS and the inner heliosheath up to a few astronomical units (AU) downstream of the TS. We show that downstream propagating nonlinear fast magnetosonic waves grow until they steepen into shocklets, overturn, and start to propagate backward in the frame of the downstream propagating wave. The counterpropagating nonlinear waves result in 2-D fast magnetosonic turbulence, which is driven by the ion-ion hybrid resonance instability. Energy is transferred from small scales to large scales in the inverse cascade range, and enstrophy is transferred from large scales to small scales in the direct cascade range. We validate our three-fluid simulations with in situ high-resolution Voyager 2 magnetic field observations in the inner heliosheath. Our simulations reproduce the observed magnetic turbulence spectrum with a spectral slope of -5/3 in frequency domain. However, the fluid-scale turbulence spectrum is not a Kolmogorov spectrum in wave number domain because Taylor's hypothesis breaks down in the inner heliosheath. The magnetic structure functions of the simulated and observed turbulence follow the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan scaling, which implies self-similarity.",

  "abstract": "Non-adiabatic energization and transport of planetary ions in the vicinity of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices at Mercury are statistically investigated using a magnetohydrodynamic model combined with a test particle tracing technique. The measurements from the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, Geochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft show signatures of KH waves in the magnetospheric flanks, especially on the duskside. We examine here the energization and transport of heavy ions of planetary origin such as Na<SUP>+</SUP> associated with the growth of the KH instability on both the dawn and dusk sides of the magnetosphere, and for both northward and southward interplanetary magnetic field configurations. We find that in all cases those planetary ions in the magnetosphere can be accelerated non-adiabatically with a level of acceleration larger on the dawnside. The transport of those ions is controlled by the convection electric field in the magnetosheath. Those planetary ions when picked up in the duskside magnetosphere where the KH waves have been mainly observed at Mercury stagnate inside the magnetosphere and, hence, are not expected to escape. The present study indicates that these ions may likely stay inside the magnetosphere and sputter the planetary surface on the duskside preferentially, being the source of secondary neutrals from the planetary surface.",

  "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is often suggested to be implicated in a variety of dynamic phenomena observed in the complex magnetosphere of Mars. We present a first global survey of ion jets within current sheets, which are thought of as a primary product of magnetic reconnection, with Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) data obtained on the dayside and nightside in the Martian magnetosphere. We develop a fully automated algorithm to efficiently and reliably identify ion flow velocity deviations during current sheet crossings recorded by MAVEN. The obtained statistical results show that (i) sunward and anti-sunward ion jets embedded within current sheets are commonly and widely observed in the dayside and nightside magnetosphere of Mars, (ii) measured magnetic field profiles and inferred magnetic topology during the jet crossings are generally consistent with those expected for reconnecting current sheets, (iii) the jet occurrence is apparently independent of upstream driver conditions, and (iv) most of the identified current sheets are thin with a roughly ion scale half-thickness and are embedded in low beta plasma, suggesting that they are seemingly capable of reconnection based on the known onset conditions. The widespread distributions and common detection of ion jets, as well as the ubiquitous presence of thin, low-beta current sheets, imply that magnetic reconnection could operate frequently in many locations around Mars, thereby playing an important role in the dynamics of the Martian magnetosphere for most, if not all, of the solar wind conditions in the present epoch.",

  "abstract": "The ionosphere of Venus is a weakly ionized plasma layer embedded in the planet's upper atmosphere. Planetary ionospheres provide an excellent opportunity to study how our variable Sun affects the planets in our solar system. Because ionospheres are reservoirs from which atmospheric species can be lost to space, studying how ionospheres respond to changes in solar activity can help us understand how planetary atmospheres have evolved since their formation. While variations of the main and lower ionospheric peaks of Venus have been well studied, the behavior of the ionosphere above the altitude of the greatest electron density has not been fully constrained. To investigate the behavior of this region, we use electron density profiles obtained by the Venus Radio Science experiment aboard Venus Express. An increase in the response of the electron density to increasing solar irradiance with increasing altitude above the peak is readily apparent in these data. By using a one-dimensional photochemical equilibrium model to investigate the factors that drive the variations of the ionosphere of Venus, we find that changes in the composition of the underlying neutral atmosphere are responsible for the observed increase in ionospheric response with altitude.",

  "abstract": "In the Earth's magnetosheath plasma waves, nonlinear structures associated with characteristic ion populations can occur. Understanding the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere requires a deeper knowledge of the underlying magnetosheath kinetic microstructure. We study a 45 min interval when the MMS spacecraft observed a southward magnetic field (Bz &lt; 0 nT) in the dayside magnetosheath. Using magnetic field and plasma data, we analyze three transient dynamic pressure enhancements identified as magnetosheath jets. The characteristics of these jets are different, suggesting different origins. While two of them, called J1 and J2, exhibit large increment in velocity and almost no density increment, the third jet (J3) shows large density enhancements with almost no velocity increment. The duration of J3 is ∼7 times longer than those of J1 and J2. J3 occurs at the region where the negative B<SUB>z</SUB> becomes positive. Ion distributions inside the jets are different. J1 and J2 show a secondary field-aligned beam, which is not present in J3, suggesting that magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause is responsible for their formation. Distributions inside J3 are more isotropic. B field and plasma signatures inside J3 correspond to the crossing of a sector boundary, similar to the heliospheric plasma sheet, suggesting that J3 forms by the evolution and interaction of a solar wind structure with the bow shock and magnetosheath. Fluctuations inside J3 have larger transverse components, although they propagate at large angles to B. In contrast, waves in regions between the jets are compressive and are identified as mirror mode waves.",

  "abstract": "This study presents simulations of the coupled space environment during a geomagnetic storm that separates the different sources of near-Earth plasma. These simulations include separate fluids for solar wind and ionospheric protons, ionospheric oxygen, and the plasmasphere. Additionally, they include the effects of both a hot ring current population and a cold plasmaspheric population simultaneously for a geomagnetic storm. The modeled ring current population represents the solution of bounce-averaged kinetic solution; the core plasmaspheric model assumes a fixed temperature of 1 eV and constant pressure along the field line. We find that during the storm, ionospheric protons can be a major contributor to the plasmasheet and ring current and that ionospheric plasma can largely displace solar wind protons in much of the magnetosphere under certain conditions. Indeed, the ionospheric source of plasma cannot be ignored. Significant hemispheric asymmetry is found between the outflow calculated in the summer and winter hemispheres, consistent with past observations. That asymmetric outflow is found to lead to asymmetric filling of the lobes, with the northern (summer) lobe receiving more outflow that has a higher proportion of O<SUP>+</SUP> and the southern (winter) lobe receiving less outflow with a higher proportion of H<SUP>+</SUP>. We moreover find that the inclusion of the plasmasphere can have a system-wide impact. Specifically, when the plasmasphere drainage plume reaches the magnetopause, it can reduce the reconnection rate, suppress ionospheric outflow and change its composition, change the composition in the magnetosphere, and reduce the ring current intensity.",

  "abstract": "The extreme substorm event on 5 April 2010 (THEMIS AL = -2,700 nT, called supersubstorm) was investigated to examine its driving processes, the aurora current system responsible for the supersubstorm, and the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T) responses. An interplanetary shock created shock aurora, but the shock was not a direct driver of the supersubstorm onset. Instead, the shock with a large southward IMF strengthened the growth phase with substantially larger ionosphere currents, more rapid equatorward motion of the auroral oval, larger ionosphere conductance, and more elevated magnetotail pressure than those for the growth phase of classical substorms. The auroral brightening at the supersubstorm onset was small, but the expansion phase had multistep enhancements of unusually large auroral brightenings and electrojets. The largest activity was an extremely large poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and subsequent auroral streamer, which started ~20 min after the substorm auroral onset during a steady southward IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> and elevated dynamic pressure. Those were associated with a substorm current wedge (SCW), plasma sheet flow, relativistic particle injection and precipitation down to the D-region, total electron content (TEC), conductance, and neutral wind in the thermosphere, all of which were unusually large compared to classical substorms. The SCW did not extend over the entire nightside auroral activity but was localized azimuthally to a few 100 km in the ionosphere around the PBI and streamer. These results reveal the importance of localized magnetotail reconnection for releasing large energy accumulation that can affect geosynchronous satellites and produce the extreme M-I-T responses.",

  "abstract": "Plasma sheet electron precipitation, much of it driven by whistler mode waves, is critical for magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. This precipitation leads to a secondary electron population at low altitudes, which moves upward along magnetic field lines to the equatorial plasma sheet. We investigate observational evidence for such electron precipitation and the ionospheric feedback provided by the secondary electron outflows. Using the near-equatorial Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission, we show that whistler mode wave bursts are accompanied by enhanced field-aligned electrons. The properties of these electrons are not related to the whistler mode waves, as would have been expected from local wave-particle interactions. Thus, it is unlikely that the field-aligned electrons are formed by electron Landau resonance with whistler mode waves. This population can be the secondary electron outflows resulting from plasma sheet electron precipitation to the ionosphere. Combining THEMIS, Cluster, and Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST) measurements, we show that this field-aligned electron population is also observed at low altitudes, where it is associated with high-frequency electrostatic waves. These low-altitude waves are likely generated by the secondary electron outflows and, in turn, scatter these electrons outside of the loss cone, allowing them to be observed by the wide field-of-view particle instrument on the near-equatorial THEMIS spacecraft. We discuss how this secondary electron population can subsequently alter whistler mode wave generation and propagation in the magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "Results from a study of automatic aurora classification using machine learning techniques are presented. The aurora is the manifestation of physical phenomena in the ionosphere-magnetosphere environment. Automatic classification of millions of auroral images from the Arctic and Antarctic is therefore an attractive tool for developing auroral statistics and for supporting scientists to study auroral images in an objective, organized, and repeatable manner. Although previous studies have presented tools for detecting aurora, there has been a lack of tools for classifying aurora into subclasses with a high precision (&gt;90%). This work considers seven auroral subclasses: breakup, colored, arcs, discrete, patchy, edge, and faint. Six different deep neural network architectures have been tested along with the well-known classification algorithms: k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and a support vector machine (SVM). A set of clean nighttime color auroral images, without clearly ambiguous auroral forms, moonlight, twilight, clouds, and so forth, were used for training and testing the classifiers. The deep neural networks generally outperformed the KNN and SVM methods, and the ResNet-50 architecture achieved the highest performance with an average classification precision of 92%.",

  "abstract": "One of the main sources of magnetospheric particles is solar wind penetration through the magnetopause—a current sheet separating the cold, dense magnetosheath from the hot, rarified magnetospheric plasmas. The mechanism responsible for magnetosheath particle transport across the magnetopause has been better investigated for the near-Earth dayside magnetopause (contrary to the nightside), where it was found that such a transport is controlled by the current sheet thickness, structure, and dynamics. Because plasma properties and magnetic field intensity in the magnetosheath significantly change as a function of radial distance from the Earth, the current sheet characteristics are different near Earth and at distant nightside magnetopause. Comparative investigations between near-Earth and distant magnetopauses, however, require statistical observations at the two locations during the same time interval, that enable control for the same upstream solar wind driving conditions. In this paper, we perform such a study using the four Magnetosheric Multiscale (MMS) and two Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) probes to compare the characteristics of magnetic field and plasma populations during magnetopause crossings, which are separated by about 50 R<SUB>E</SUB>. We find that the current sheet profiles is similar at two locations. We also show that the magnetopause current sheet thickness scales with the local magnetosheath ion gyroradius. A weaker magnetic field on both sides of the current sheet is correlated with smaller current density at lunar distances.",

  "abstract": "Space weather is the main source of uncertainty in the position of all objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) below about 1,000 km. The main impact is strong variation in the neutral density of the thermosphere as it responds to radiative inputs from the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet wavelength range, energetic particle precipitation in the high-latitude auroral zones, and global-scale electrical currents generated during geomagnetic storms. Waves and instabilities from the lower atmosphere can also influence thermospheric density in complex ways. The variation in neutral density leads to variable drag forces on satellites flying through the thermosphere, which in turn causes orbital track changes. We currently lack the ability to accurately model and predict the neutral density changes in the thermosphere in response to space weather inputs. Operational empirical models of thermospheric density are inaccurate during space weather events, and mandate that LEO orbital tracks carry large \"error ellipsoids\" around all objects to account for positional uncertainty. This leads to many more \"conjunction\" warnings than necessary as large error ellipsoids are frequently calculated to intersect in orbit. As the LEO domain becomes more crowded with the advent of commercial \"megaconstellations\" we face a growing challenge to reduce orbital uncertainties by developing whole atmosphere models to enable timely and accurate forecasts of thermospheric conditions. We recommend that researchers, forecasters, and policy makers coordinate to ensure that space weather research and forecasting is tightly integrated into upcoming changes to the operational Space Traffic Management system.",

  "abstract": "The magnetotail current sheet carries the current responsible for the largest fraction of the energy storage in the magnetotail, the magnetic energy in the lobes. It is thus inextricably linked with the dynamics and evolution of many magnetospheric phenomena, such as substorms. The magnetotail current sheet structure and stability depend mostly on the kinetic properties of the plasma populating the magnetotail. One of the most underinvestigated properties of this plasma is electron temperature anisotropy, which may contribute a large fraction of the total current. Using observations from five missions in the magnetotail, we examine the electron temperature anisotropy, T<SUB>e‖</SUB>/T<SUB>e⊥</SUB>, and its potential contribution to the current density, quantified by the firehose parameter (β<SUB>e‖</SUB>-β<SUB>e⊥</SUB>)/2, across y∈[-20,20]R<SUB>E</SUB> and x∈[-100,-10]R<SUB>E</SUB>. We find that a significant fraction (&gt;30%) of all current sheets have an anisotropic electron current density &gt;10% of the total current. These current sheets form two distinct groups: (1) near-Earth (&lt;30 R<SUB>E</SUB>) accompanied by weak plasma flows (&lt;100 km/s) and enhanced equatorial magnetic field (&gt;3 nT) and (2) middle tail (&gt;40 R<SUB>E</SUB>) accompanied by fast plasma flows (&gt;300 km/s) and small equatorial magnetic field (≤1 nT). For a significant number of near-Earth current sheets, the anisotropic electron current can be &gt;25% of the total current density. Our findings suggest that electron temperature anisotropy should be included in current sheet models describing realistic magnetotail structure and dynamics.",

The study of these kilometer-scale instabilities has provided crucial insight into coupling between the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. A special high-time cadence observation mode developed for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission has demonstrated for the first time that kilometer-scale density fluctuations exist at Mars. Density and associated magnetic fluctuations are observed to occur both in and out of phase with each other, suggesting that multiple instability mechanisms are active, similar to Earth. The unique solar wind interaction with Mars and its localized crustal magnetic fields appears to play an important role in the formation of these irregularity events, which form preferentially during meridionally pointing magnetic field within the ionosphere. This is in contrast to Earth where the strong dipole magnetic field dominates in the terrestrial ionosphere.",

  "abstract": "We have used the Auburn Global Hybrid Code in 3-D to study the generation, dynamics, and global structure of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) from the magnetotail to the ionosphere. Our results show that KAWs are generated in magnetic reconnection in the plasma sheet, located around fast flows, and carrying transverse electromagnetic perturbations, parallel Poynting fluxes, parallel currents, and parallel electric field. Overall, shear Alfvénic turbulent spectrum is found in the plasma sheet. The KAWs are shear Alfvén waves possessing short perpendicular wavelength with k<SUB>⊥</SUB>ρ<SUB>i</SUB>∼1, where k<SUB>⊥</SUB> is the perpendicular wave number and ρ<SUB>i</SUB> the ion Larmor radius. The KAWs are identified by their dispersion relation and polarizations. The structures of these KAWs embedded in the plasma sheet are also revealed by placing a virtual satellite in the tail. In order to understand whether the Poynting fluxes carried by the shear Alfvén waves/KAWs in the plasma sheet can be carried directly along field lines to the ionosphere, we have tracked the wave propagation from the plasma sheet to the ionosphere. It is found that in front of the flow-braking region, the structure and strength of the shear Alfvén waves are significantly altered due to interaction with the dipole-like field, mainly by the flow shear associated with the azimuthal convection. Also in front of the dipole-like field region, ion kinetic effects (Hall effects) lead to the generation of additional pairs of KAWs. As such, the generation and transport of the shear Alfvén waves/KAWs to the ionosphere are illustrated for the first time in a comprehensive manner on the global scale.",

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) results suggest that the asymmetry in how open field lines connected to the planet populate the tail causes the apparent twist. To validate this interpretation, we compare the tail topology determined from MHD simulations to that inferred from data collected by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft, in particular, how each topology responds to the upstream IMF orientation. The occurrence rates for open topology from both data and MHD vary with IMF polarities in a similar fashion as the tail twisting. This suggests that Mars's crustal fields have a global effect on the magnetosphere configuration, supporting the picture of a \"hybrid\" magnetotail that is partly induced/draped and partly intrinsic/planetary in origin.",

The relative importance of different plasma entry mechanisms and pathways is largely determined by the solar wind conditions. Therefore, the spatial and temporal dependence of magnetotail plasma and field properties under different kinds of solar wind conditions is critically important for understanding the Earth's magnetosphere. This study presents a statistical study of fundamental magnetotail plasma properties in a normalized reference frame by utilizing 12+ years of data from NASA's Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission. These statistical maps are mostly in agreement with the magnetosheath of MHD runs from the CCMC BATS-R-US model, but some features in the maps can be explained by kinetic particle physics, not present in the MHD.

The future changes in GLM summer precipitation and the sources of projection uncertainty under four scenarios are investigated using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. The GLM summer precipitation is projected to increase by 1.76 ± 1.57% (2.54 ± 2.22%), 1.33 ± 1.97% (3.52 ± 3.05%), 0.96 ± 2.04% (3.51 ± 4.97%), and 1.71 ± 2.38% (5.75 ± 5.92%) in the near (long) term under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The enhancement is caused by thermodynamic responses due to increased moisture, which is partly offset by dynamic responses due to weakened circulation. The uncertainty in GLM precipitation projection is the largest in SSP5-8.5 long-term projection. The uncertainty of submonsoon precipitation projections is larger than that in GLM precipitation. The uncertainty of monsoon precipitation projection arises from the circulation changes, which can be partly explained by model-dependent response to uniform sea surface temperature warming.",

  "abstract": "Satellite observations with high-resolution measurements have demonstrated the existence of intermittent current sheets and occurrence of magnetic reconnection in a quasi-parallel magnetosheath behind the terrestrial bow shock. In this letter, by performing a three-dimensional global hybrid simulation, we investigated the characteristics of the quasi-parallel magnetosheath of the bow shock, which is formed due to the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. Current sheets with widths of several ion inertial lengths are found to be produced in the magnetosheath after the upstream large-amplitude electromagnetic waves penetrate through the shock and are then compressed in the downstream. Magnetic reconnection consequently occurs in these current sheets, where high-speed ion flow jets are identified in the outflow region. Simultaneously, flux ropes with the extension (along the y direction) of about several Earth's radii are also observed. Our simulation shed new insight on the mechanism for the occurrence of magnetic reconnection in the quasi-parallel shocked magnetosheath.",

  "abstract": "We report the first results of a global ionosphere/thermosphere simulation study that self-consistently generates large-scale equatorial spread F (ESF) plasma bubbles in the postsunset ionosphere. The coupled model comprises the ionospheric code SAMI3 and the atmosphere/thermosphere code WACCM-X. Two cases are modeled for different seasons and geophysical conditions: the March case (low solar activity: F10.7 = 70) and the July case (high solar activity: F10.7 = 170). We find that equatorial plasma bubbles formed and penetrated into the topside F layer for the March case but not the July case. For the March case, a series of bubbles formed in the Atlantic sector with irregularity spacings in the range 400-1,200 km, rose to over 800 km, and persisted until after midnight. These results are consistent with recent GOLD observations. Calculation of the generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability (GRTI) growth rate shows that the e-folding time was shorter for the March case than the July case.",

  "abstract": "The moon Dione orbits Saturn at 6.2 Saturn radii R<SUB>S</SUB> deep in the Kronian magnetosphere. In situ studies of the moon-magnetosphere interaction processes near Dione were possible with the Cassini/Huygens mission which flew by close to Dione five times at distances between 99 and 516 km. In addition, Cassini crossed Dione's L-shell more than 400 times between 2004 and 2017 and documented the variability of Saturn's magnetosphere. Different flyby geometries allowed to study the interaction processes upstream, in the low-energy wake, and above the north pole of Dione. We describe here the energetic particle measurements from the Low Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS), part of the Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument (MIMI) onboard Cassini. We also use hybrid simulation results from \"A.I.K.E.F.\" to interpret the signatures in the particle fluxes. This paper is a continuation of Krupp et al. (2013, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.06.007\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2013.06.007</A>) and Kotova et al.

The key results are as follows: (1) Saturn's magnetosphere at Dione's orbit is highly variable with changes in energetic charged particle fluxes by 1-2 orders of magnitude. (2) The dropout signatures near Dione are basically consistent with a fully absorbing obstacle, but some features point to more complex interaction processes than plasma and energetic particle absorption. (3) Absorption signatures are found to be asymmetric with respect to the orientation of the moon, indicative of the presence of radial drift components for electrons. (4) The deepest absorption signatures were observed at the edge of the low-energy wake pointing to gradient-B drifts strongest in that part of the interaction region.",

The observed O/N<SUB>2</SUB> column density depletion of more than 10% starts at the onset of the SSW, maximizes at the time of the stratospheric wind reversal, and recovers toward the end of the SSW. A connection between SSW and thermospheric composition was previously predicted by model simulations but could not be observed before. The GOLD measurements support the scenario that enhanced global-scale wave activity during SSWs causes an enhanced wave driving of the lower thermosphere zonal mean circulation that leads to a reduction in lower thermosphere atomic oxygen, which then propagates through molecular diffusion into the upper thermosphere.",

  "abstract": "Mercury's nightside magnetosphere is investigated under the impact of a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a high-speed stream (HSS) with MErcury Surface, Space ENviroment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) observations. The CME was shown to produce a low plasma β (ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) magnetosheath, while the HSS creates a higher β magnetosheath. Reconnection at the dayside magnetopause was found to be stronger during the CME than the HSS, but both were stronger than the average condition (Slavin et al., 2014, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020319\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020319</A>). Here we show that the CME and HSS events produced large numbers of flux ropes and dipolarization fronts in the plasma sheet. The occurrence rates for the structures were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than under average conditions with the rates during CME's being twice that of HSS's. The flux ropes appeared as quasiperiodic flux rope groups. Each group lasted approximately 1 min and had a few large flux ropes followed by several smaller flux ropes. The lobe magnetic flux accounted for around half of the Mercury's available magnetic flux with the flux during CME's being larger than that of HSS's. The CME produced a more dynamic nightside magnetosphere than the HSS. Further, for the CME event, the tail magnetic reconnection produced a distorted Hall magnetic field pattern and the X-line had a dawn-dusk extent of 20% of the tail width. No magnetic flux loading and unloading events were observed suggesting that, during these intense driving conditions, Mercury's magnetosphere responded with a type of quasi-steady convection as opposed to the tail flux loading-unloading events seen at Earth.",

  "abstract": "The Earth's dipole tilt angle changes both diurnally and seasonally and introduces numerous variabilities in the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. By altering the location and intensity of magnetic reconnection, the dipole tilt influences convection on a global scale. However, due to the nonlinear nature of the system, various other effects like dipole rotation, varying interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation, and nonuniform ionospheric conductance can smear tilt effects arising purely from changes in coupling with the solar wind. To elucidate the underlying tilt angle dependence, we perform magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the steady-state magnetosphere-ionosphere system under purely southward IMF conditions for tilt angles from 0-90°. We identify the location of the magnetic separator in each case and find that an increasing tilt angle shifts the 3-D X line southward on the magnetopause due to changes in magnetic shear angle. The separator is highly unsteady above 50° tilt angle, characteristic of regular flux transfer event (FTE) generation on the magnetopause. The reconnection rate drops as the tilt angle becomes large, but remains continuous across the dayside such that the magnetosphere is open even for 90°. These trends map down to the ionosphere, with the polar cap contracting as the tilt angle increases, and region I field-aligned current (FAC) migrating to higher latitudes with changing morphology. The tilt introduces a north-south asymmetry in magnetospheric convection, thus driving more FAC in the Northern (sunward facing) hemisphere for large tilt angles than in the Southern independent of conductance. These results highlight the strong sensitivity to onset time in the potential impact of a severe space weather event.",

  "abstract": "For decades, radio remote-sensing techniques have been used to probe the plasma structure of the solar corona at distances of 2 - 20 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Measurement of Faraday rotation, the change in the polarization position angle of linearly polarized radiation as it propagates through a magnetized plasma, has proven to be one of the best methods for determining the coronal magnetic-field strength and structure. Faraday-rotation observations of spatially extended radio sources provide the unique opportunity to measure differential Faraday rotation [Δ RM] the difference in the Faraday-rotation measure between two closely spaced lines of sight (LOS) through the corona. Δ RM is proportional to the electric current within an Ampèrian loop formed, in part, by the two closely spaced LOS. We report the expected Δ RM for two sets of models for the corona: one set of models for the corona employs a spherically symmetric plasma density, while the other breaks this symmetry by assuming that the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is a finite-width streamer-belt region containing a high-density plasma. For each plasma-density model, we evaluate the Δ RM for three model coronal magnetic fields: a radial dipole and interplanetary magnetic field (DIMF), a dipole + current sheet (DCS), and a dipole + quadrupole + current sheet (DQCS). These models predict values of 0.01 ≲Δ RM ≲120 radm-<SUP>2</SUP> over the range of parameter space accessible by modern instruments such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We conclude that the HCS contribution to Δ RM is not negligible at moderate heliocentric distances (&lt;8 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and may account for ≲20 % of previous observations of Δ RM (e.g. made by Spangler, Astrophys. J.670, 841, 2007).",

  "abstract": "Ionospheric outflow is an important plasma source that feeds the near-Earth magnetotail with heavy oxygen ions. Because these ions can significantly alter the structure and stability of the magnetotail current sheet, the characteristics of this outflow are important for accurate magnetosphere modeling, including modeling of substorms—a key element of magnetosphere dynamics. Using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft measurements in the magnetotail (around the plasma sheet boundary), we investigate characteristics oxygen outflows observed during substorm growth phases. The observed oxygen ion temperature and flow energy indicate that the outflow is marginally stable to ion acoustic wave generation: The oxygen temperature is slightly lower than the electron temperature and slightly higher than the oxygen flow energy. Moreover, the observed outflows are accompanied by low frequency electrostatic waves that may contribute to outflow thermalization. The oxygen bulk velocity has a significant component directed toward the equatorial plane, originating from the cross-field drift in the convection electric field. The estimated radial distances at which oxygen ions reach the plasma sheet are ∼20-40R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail, that is, outflows during substorm growth phases can alter current sheet characteristics around the potential magnetic reconnection region.",

During substorms, hot electrons were injected energy-dispersively into the plasmasphere near the dawnside and, probably through a combination of linear and nonlinear cyclotron resonances, generated whistler-mode waves with globally drifting frequencies. These waves were able to propagate from the dawnside to the noonside, with the frequency-drifting feature retained.

Previous work has developed expressions for how uncertainties in electron density and neutral density depend on uncertainty in frequency. However, these expressions assume that the relevant density decreases exponentially with increasing altitude, which limits their applicability. Here we develop alternative expressions for uncertainties in radio occultation experiments. We find that uncertainties depend on the vertical resolution. We validate these expressions on radio occultation observations by Mars Global Surveyor and MAVEN. These expressions can be used to perform preliminary design studies of future radio occultation experiments.",

  "abstract": "While Saturn's largest moon Titan is devoid of an intrinsic magnetic field, draping of the giant planet's magnetospheric field around Titan's ionosphere generates a pile-up region at the moon's ramside. In this study, we analyze Cassini magnetic field data from all 126 Titan flybys to systematically characterize the extensions and magnitudes of the field enhancements at its ramside. Along each flyby trajectory, the segments where Cassini crossed the piled-up magnetic field are determined, and altitude profiles of the pile-up strength are also generated. We investigate the dependency of the extension and strength of the pile-up region on various parameters, such as the Saturn local time and the magnetospheric environment to which Titan is exposed. In this way, we generate a comprehensive picture of Titan's ramside magnetic pile-up region during the Cassini era. Our major findings are: (1) The extensions of the observed pile-up reveal an asymmetry between the Saturn-facing and Saturn-averted sides caused by the large gyro-radii of ionospheric pick-up ions. (2) The observed pile-up radial extensions are nearly independent of Titan's orbital position. (3) The lower boundary of the pile-up region is located at an altitude of 0.35 Titan radius, denoting the average altitude of the magnetic ionopause. (4) Considering the error bars, the altitude profiles of the pile-up strength show a stable picture, i.e., the radial profile of the field magnitude is independent of Saturn's magnetospheric environment and local time.",

Despite large statistical observations on this phenomenon in the Earth's magnetotail, many important characteristics (e.g., mass or charge dependence of acceleration efficiency and acceleration scaling with the spatial scale of the system) of transient reconnection cannot be fully investigated with the limited parameter range of the Earth's magnetotail. The much larger Jovian magnetodisk, filled by a mixture of various heavy ions and protons, provides a unique opportunity for such investigations. In this study, we use recent Juno observations in Jupiter's magnetosphere to examine the properties of reconnection associated dipolarization fronts and charged particle acceleration. High-energy fluxes of sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen ions show clear mass-dependent acceleration with energy ∼m<SUP>1/3</SUP>.

  "abstract": "Studies of lunar paleopoles have been used to make a variety of inferences about past episodes of true polar wander and the orientation of the ancient dynamo field. However, the large and variable uncertainties commonly reported for such studies make robust conclusions difficult. To make further progress, we used synthetic magnetic anomalies to assess a common method to estimate magnetization direction uncertainty. We find that with this method, magnetic anomalies with higher inclinations have systematically higher uncertainties than lower inclination anomalies. We call this effect inclination bias. A similar effect is found for declination, but it is weaker. We also find that this method often produces overly conservative uncertainty estimates. To avoid these effects, we use Monte Carlo methods to determine magnetization direction uncertainty. We apply our methods to five lunar magnetic anomalies with a wide range of reported magnetization directions and paleopole locations. We find that inclination bias partly explains the previously reported anomalously high and low direction uncertainties for two of these anomalies: Reiner Gamma and Airy. Our more robust uncertainties allow us to conclude that four paleopoles are located near the equator. Such low latitudes cannot be explained by true polar wander inferred from other independent datasets, such as the lunar gravity field and the polar hydrogen distribution. This in turn implies that the dynamo axis was once offset from the spin axis.",

  "abstract": "The MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft regularly observed the magnetospheric flanks of Mercury during its orbital phase. Data from the Magnetometer (MAG) and the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) allow us to investigate the statistical properties of planetary ions (Na<SUP>+</SUP>) in the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) waves at the duskside magnetopause. We collect the data from orbits with clear signatures of KH waves under northward interplanetary magnetic field, as well as from adjacent orbits that do not have KH signatures, and we compare the energy characteristics between the KH and non-KH events. Although low planetary counts in FIPS data make the comparison of these characteristics difficult, we find that in the presence of KH waves: (1) large counts of planetary ions are observed and (2) differences in Na<SUP>+</SUP> energy spectra are only seen inside the magnetosphere, where they show a deceleration signature for ions with energies above 2.0 keV/e. These results suggest that planetary ions are not escaping from the magnetosphere and that electric field structures related to KH waves can decelerate planetary ions originating from the magnetotail region. The understanding of the energy distribution of planetary ions in the magnetospheric flanks of Mercury is important for a better understanding of plasma convection in the magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "Energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) created by charge-exchange of ions with the Earth's hydrogen exosphere near the subsolar magnetopause yield information on the distribution of plasma in the outer magnetosphere and magnetosheath. ENA observations from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) are used to image magnetosheath plasma and, for the first time, low-energy magnetospheric plasma near the magnetopause. These images show that magnetosheath plasma is distributed fairly evenly near the subsolar magnetopause; however, low-energy magnetospheric plasma is not distributed evenly in the outer magnetosphere. Simultaneous images and in situ observations from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft from November 2015 (during the solar cycle declining phase) are used to derive the exospheric density. The ~11-17 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> density at 10 R<SUB>E</SUB> is similar to that obtained previously for solar minimum.

We present a statistical study of these structures, known as jets and fast plasmoids, in the magnetosheath, downstream of both the quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel bow shocks. Using measurements from the four Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft and OMNI solar wind data from 2015-2017, we present observations of jets during different upstream conditions and in the wide range of distances from the bow shock. Jets observed downstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock are seen to propagate deeper and faster into the magnetosheath and on toward the magnetopause. We estimate the shape of the structures by treating the leading edge as a shock surface, and the result is that the jets are elongated in the direction of propagation but also that they expand more quickly in the perpendicular direction as they propagate through the magnetosheath.",

  "abstract": "We examine the final 44 orbits of the Cassini spacecraft traversing the midnight sector of Saturn's magnetosphere to distances of ~21 Saturn radii, to investigate responses to heliospheric conditions inferred from model solar wind and Cassini galactic cosmic ray flux data. Clear storm responses to anticipated magnetospheric compressions are observed in magnetic field and energetic particle data, together with Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR), auroral hiss, and ultraviolet auroral emissions. Most compression events are associated with corotating interaction regions, producing ~2-3.5 day intervals of magnetospheric activity that are recurrent with the ~26 day solar rotation period (one or two such events per rotation), though one on the final pass is related to a nonrecurrent interplanetary shock possibly associated with an earlier X-class solar flare. The response to compressions is modulated by the concurrent relative phasing of the northern and southern planetary period oscillation (PPO) systems, with long (&gt;1 planetary rotation) SKR low-frequency extension (LFE) intervals associated with strong field-aligned coupling currents being favored when the two PPO systems act together to thin and thicken the tail plasma sheet during each PPO cycle. LFE onsets/intensifications are then favored at thin plasma sheet phases most unstable to reconnection, producing energetic nightside particle injections and poleward contractions of dawn-brightened auroras. Correspondingly, solar rotation recurrent intervals of magnetospheric quiet conditions also occur with weak energetic particle fluxes and auroral emissions, associated with extended solar wind rarefactions. Overall, the results emphasize how strongly activity in Saturn's magnetosphere is modulated by concurrent heliospheric conditions.",

  "abstract": "Lower hybrid waves are investigated at the magnetosheath separatrix region in asymmetric guide field reconnection by using the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Three of the four MMS spacecraft observe clear wave activities around the lower hybrid frequency across the magnetosheath separatrix, where a density gradient is present. The observed waves are consistent with generation by the lower hybrid drift instability. The characteristic properties of these waves include the following: (1) the waves propagate toward the x-line in the spacecraft frame due to the large out-of-plane magnetic field, which is in the same direction of the diamagnetic drift of the x-line; (2) the wave potential is about 20% of the electron temperature. These drift waves effectively produce cross-field particle diffusion, enabling the transport of magnetosheath electrons into the exhaust region. At last, we suggest that the lower hybrid waves at the magnetosheath separatrix region represent some unique features of asymmetric guide field reconnection, which is different from that widely observed at the magnetospheric side of magnetopause reconnection.",

  "abstract": "We study the interannual variability of atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) in the Martian thermosphere and their relation to the background temperatures using Ar densities measured by Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer/Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN). The amplitudes and wavelengths of the GWs are extracted from the neutral density perturbations in the inbound segment of the MAVEN orbit. The GW amplitudes predominantly lie between 5% and 10% and are mostly less than 30% of the background densities. The horizontal wavelengths are between 50 km and 300 km with peak wavelengths of 100-130 km. GW amplitudes show a significant diurnal variation with larger amplitudes during nighttime and smaller amplitudes during daytime. In addition, the GW amplitudes negatively correlate with the background temperatures indicating the role of convective instability in the saturation of the GWs. Most importantly, the GW amplitudes are larger and the wavelengths are smaller when there was a planet-encircling dust event in the Mars' lower atmosphere during 2018. As a result, the typical diurnal variation of GW amplitudes is not apparent. During the lower atmospheric dust event, the GW amplitudes do not show any significant correlation with the background temperatures. It is proposed that the PEDE-2018 led to changes in the circulation of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, so that the modified circulation enhanced the upward propagation/reduced the filtering of GWs leading to their enhancement in the upper thermosphere.",

  "abstract": "Jupiter's giant magnetosphere is a complex system seldom in a configuration approximating steady state, and a clear picture of its governing dynamics remains elusive. Crucial to understanding how the magnetosphere behaves on a large scale are disturbances to the system on length-scales comparable to the cavity, which are communicated by magnetohydrodynamic waves in the ultralow-frequency band (&lt;1 mHz). In this study we used magnetometer data from multiple spacecraft to perform the first global heritage survey of these waves in the magnetosphere. To map the equatorial region, we relied on the large local-time coverage provided by the Galileo spacecraft. Flyby encounters performed by Voyager 1 and 2, Pioneer 10 and 11, and Ulysses provided local-time coverage of the dawn sector. We found several hundred events where significant wave power was present, with periods spanning ∼5-60 min. The majority of events consisted of multiple superposed discrete periods. Periods at ∼15, ∼30, and ∼40 min dominated the event-averaged spectrum, consistent with the spectra of quasi-periodic pulsations often reported in the literature. Most events were clustered in the outer magnetosphere close to the magnetopause at noon and dusk, suggesting that an external driving mechanism may dominate. The most energetic events occurred close to the planet, though more sporadically, indicating an accumulation of wave energy in the inner magnetosphere or infrequent impulsive drivers in the region. Our findings suggest that dynamics of the system at large scales is modulated by this diverse population of waves, which permeate the magnetosphere through several cavities and wave guides.",

  "abstract": "Ionospheric conductance is a crucial factor in regulating the closure of magnetospheric field-aligned currents through the ionosphere as Hall and Pedersen currents. Despite its importance in predictive investigations of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, the estimation of ionospheric conductance in the auroral region is precarious in most global first-principles-based models. This impreciseness in estimating the auroral conductance impedes both our understanding and predictive capabilities of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system during extreme space weather events. In this article, we address this concern, with the development of an advanced Conductance Model for Extreme Events (CMEE) that estimates the auroral conductance from field-aligned current values. CMEE has been developed using nonlinear regression over a year's worth of 1-min resolution output from assimilative maps, specifically including times of extreme driving of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The model also includes provisions to enhance the conductance in the aurora using additional adjustments to refine the auroral oval. CMEE has been incorporated within the Ridley Ionosphere Model (RIM) of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) for usage in space weather simulations. This paper compares performance of CMEE against the existing conductance model in RIM, through a validation process for six space weather events. The performance analysis indicates overall improvement in the ionospheric feedback to ground-based space weather forecasts. Specifically, the model is able to improve the prediction of ionospheric currents, which impact the simulated dB/dt and ΔB, resulting in substantial improvements in dB/dt predictive skill.",

We apply this procedure to observational data and to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model output from 1-31 January 2005. We show that this procedure is capable of rejecting false positive identifications and filling data gaps that appear in individual lists. The resulting combined onset lists produce a waiting time distribution that is comparable to previously published results, and superposed epoch analyses of the solar wind driving conditions and magnetospheric response during the resulting onset times are also comparable to previous results. Comparison of the substorm onset list from the MHD model to that obtained from observational data reveals that the MHD model reproduces many of the characteristic features of the observed substorms, in terms of solar wind driving, magnetospheric response, and waiting time distribution. Heidke skill scores show that the MHD model has statistically significant skill in predicting substorm onset times.",

In order to facilitate researchers to use full-disk chromosphere observation, algorithms have been developed to standardize the full-disk images. The algorithms include the determination of the center of the image and size standardization, geometric correction and intensity normalization. The solar limb of each image is determined from a histogram analysis of its intensity distribution. The center and radius are then calculated and the image is corrected for geometric distortions. Images are re-scaled to have a fixed radius of 500 pixels and centered within the 1024 × 1024 frame. Finally, large-scale variations in intensity, such as limb-darkening, are removed using a median filter. This paper provides a detailed description of these algorithms, and a summary of the properties of these chromospheric full-disk observations to be used for further scientific investigations.",

  "abstract": "Since 1892, when an aurora was first imaged by Martin Brendel, a German physicist, auroral forms and their dynamics have been acquired only when the aurora is in darkness. Due to the sunlight contamination from Rayleigh scattering, it has been a long-term challenge of imaging sunlit aurora. In addition, other constraints exist, such as moonlight contamination, cloud occultation, and the limited land area available for installing imagers near the auroral zone in both hemispheres. While auroral imaging from space provides auroral global dynamics or small-scale structures, depending on the spacecraft orbit, the image quality is affected by low spatial and temporal resolutions, sunlight, and the lack of traceability of auroral variations. Consequently, we have little knowledge of sunlit auroral forms and their dynamics, as well as their coupling to conjugate aurora. Given the fact that the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is initiated on the dayside, understanding sunlit and dayside aurorae becomes very interesting and important. A scenario of imaging sunlit aurora from a balloon and the conceptual design of the instrument have been depicted in our previous article (Zhou et al., 2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL028611\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL028611</A>). This paper elaborates the new science enabled by this new means and the feasibility of auroral ballooning by showing some sunlit auroral images obtained from a balloon flight and calculations of the corresponding sky brightness. In addition, we describe and explain the most important specs of the new NIR camera-head being developed for the BALBOA balloon mission that is currently supported by the NASA/Low Cost Access to Space program.",

  "abstract": "This paper characterizes the impacts of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) and mesospheric coolings (MCs) on the light species distribution (i.e., helium [He], and atomic hydrogen [H]) of the thermosphere using a combined data-modeling approach. Performing a set of numerical experiments with a general circulation model whose middle atmospheric dynamical and thermodynamical fields were constrained using a numerical weather prediction system, we simulate the effects of SSWs and MCs on light chemical species, and via comparisons with two data sets taken from the mesosphere and thermosphere, we quantify the associated variability in light species abundances and mass density. Large depletions in the observed and modeled polar H abundance in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) occur with MC onset, as opposed to SSW onset. Depletions in all light thermospheric species at high northern latitudes extend up to the exobase in our model simulations during the January 2013 SSW/MC period, with the largest depletions simulated for the lightest species. Further, our modeling work substantiates the paradigm of increased mixing in the MLT driven by a meridional residual circulation during SSWs resulting from enhanced small-scale gravity wave and migrating semidiurnal tidal forcing; the former being the primary driver and the latter of secondary but notable importance in our model simulations. SSW/MC induced light species variability then gets projected upward into the thermosphere through molecular diffusion. Modeled light species variability during the January 2013 SSW/MC event suggests SSW/MC signatures could be present in the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere.",

  "abstract": "We present a new version of the high-resolution Kühlungsborn Mechanistic general Circulation Model (KMCM) extended to z ∼ 450 km. This model is called HIAMCM (HI Altitude Mechanistic general Circulation Model) and explicitly simulates gravity waves (GWs) down to horizontal wavelengths of λ<SUB>h</SUB> ∼ 165 km. We find predominant tertiary GWs in the winter thermosphere at middle/high latitudes. These GWs typically have horizontal wavelengths λ<SUB>h</SUB> ∼ 300-1,100 km, ground-based periods ∼ 25-90 min, and intrinsic horizontal phase speeds c<SUB>Ih</SUB> ∼ 250-350 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Above z ∼ 200 km, the predominant GW horizontal propagation directions are roughly against the background winds from the diurnal tide; the GWs propagate mainly poleward at midnight, eastward at 6 local time (LT), equatorward at noon, and westward at 18 LT. Wintertime GWs at z ∼ 300 km having 165 km ≤ λ<SUB>h</SUB> ≤ 330 km create a large hot spot over the Southern Andes/Antarctic Peninsula that agrees well with quiet time satellite measurements. Due to cancelation effects, the time-averaged zonal mean Eliassen-Palm flux divergence from the resolved GWs in the thermosphere is negligible compared to that of the tides and compared to the zonal component of the time-averaged zonal mean ion drag. We also find that the thermospheric GWs dissipate mainly from macroturbulent diffusion and, above z ∼ 200 km, from molecular diffusion, whereas the tides dissipate mainly from ion drag. The averaged dissipative heating in the thermosphere due to tides is much stronger than that due to GWs.",

Therefore, real-time density estimation is required to improve orbit prediction. In this work, we develop a dynamic reduced-order model for the thermospheric density that enables real-time density estimation using two-line element (TLE) data. For this, the global thermospheric density is represented by the main spatial modes of the atmosphere and a time-varying low-dimensional state and a linear model is derived for the dynamics. Three different models are developed based on density data from the TIE-GCM, NRLMSISE-00, and JB2008 thermosphere models and are valid from 100 to maximum 800 km altitude. Using the models and TLE data, the global density is estimated by simultaneously estimating the density and the orbits and ballistic coefficients of several objects using a Kalman filter. The sequential estimation provides both estimates of the density and corresponding uncertainty. Accurate density estimation using the TLEs of 17 objects is demonstrated and validated against CHAMP and GRACE accelerometer-derived densities. The estimated densities are shown to be significantly more accurate and less biased than NRLMSISE-00 and JB2008 modeled densities. The uncertainty in the density estimates is quantified and shown to be dependent on the geographical location, solar activity, and objects used for estimation. In addition, the data assimilation capability of the model is highlighted by assimilating CHAMP accelerometer-derived density data together with TLE data to obtain more accurate global density estimates. Finally, the dynamic thermosphere model is used to forecast the density.",

  "abstract": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) has been imaging the thermosphere and ionosphere since October 2018. It provides continuous measurements over a large area from its geostationary orbit. The unambiguous two-dimensional (2-D) maps of OI 135.6 nm radiance retrieved from GOLD after sunset are compared with the total electron content (TEC) maps measured by GPS receivers in the American sector. The OI 135.6 nm radiance observed by GOLD is an indicator of the peak electron density of the ionosphere F2 region, while the TEC is the total electron density in the column. Our comparisons show that the two data sets match each other very well in the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) morphology and its seasonal variability. Equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) are evident in GOLD nighttime OI 135.6 radiance. Corresponding depletions are shown in TEC maps, but without GOLD data as a reference, it is difficult to discern that the depletions are EPBs. In addition, both GOLD 135.6 radiance and TEC maps observed third peaks of electron density poleward of the southern EIA crests. Furthermore, both show that the ionosphere after sunset is quite dynamic and has strong day-to-day variability. In all, the GOLD and TEC have valuable synergy to allow us to gain a better understanding of the equatorial ionosphere.",

  "abstract": "The space age began while I was a Physics student at Berkeley. NASA stimulated space research by the creation of eight centers of excellence each with a new building and very large grants. These centers became the nucleus of research activities that continue 55 years later. Data from new instruments and spacecraft provided unique opportunities for young people to make significant discoveries. In my case the concept of the auroral substorm was crucial, as later were data from the first instrumented synchronous satellite ATS-1, and one of the first eccentric orbiters OGO-5. In this account I describe my early experiences and the difficulties of completing my undergraduate degree. I then describe graduate work at Berkeley and multiple trips to the auroral zone. On completion of my PhD I began work at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and soon became a professor. My graduate work and early research as a professor enabled me to introduce important concepts including the substorm growth phase, the concept of a magnetospheric substorm, the substorm current wedge, the near-Earth neutral line, the dipolarization of the synchronous magnetic field during substorms, the semiannual variation in geomagnetic activity, and algorithms to predict the Dst index and AL index. I also did extensive work in investigations of ULF waves, magnetic storms, and the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere, but these occurred later and are not discussed. I end with the question of whether it is possible today for young people with a background similar to mine to achieve similar success.",

At ~27-33 amu/e, Earth's MIs dominate over lunar pickup ions (PUIs) in the magnetosphere; MIs are roughly comparable to lunar PUIs in the magnetosheath, and lunar PUIs dominate over MIs beyond Earth's bow shock.

However, how the solar wind decompressions related to frequently occurring discontinuities compete with the proton injections in the evolution of EMIC waves has been rarely investigated. Here we present a complete end-to-end observation by Wind, THEMIS, and Van Allen Probes missions during the main phase of the 23 February 2014 storm of a succession of solar wind rotational discontinuities decompressing the magnetosphere within 200 s, adiabatically decelerating the freshly injected &gt;10 keV protons, and thus suppressing the EMIC waves in the inner magnetosphere. Our results highlight the importance of solar wind conditions for the evolution of inner magnetospheric EMIC waves from a new perspective.",

These electrons have preferentially field-aligned anisotropies from 1.2 to &gt;2 at energies ranging from tens of electron volts to several kiloelectron volts (keV), with largest values being coincident with magnetic field dipolarizations. Comparisons reveal that DAW energy densities and Poynting fluxes are strongly correlated with precipitating electron energies and energy fluxes and also O<SUP>+</SUP> ion outflow energies. These observations yield empirical inner magnetosphere relations between the DAW and electron inputs and the O<SUP>+</SUP> ion outflow response, providing important constraints for models.

  "abstract": "The Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission of opportunity designed to study how the Earth's ionosphere-thermosphere system responds to geomagnetic storms, solar radiation, and upward propagating atmospheric tides and waves. GOLD employs two identical ultraviolet spectrographs that make observations of the Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere from a commercial communications satellite owned and operated by Société Européenne des Satellites (SES) and located in geostationary orbit at 47.5° west longitude (near the mouth of the Amazon River). They make images of atomic oxygen 135.6 nm and N<SUB>2</SUB> Lyman-Birge-Hopfield radiances from the entire disk that is observable from geostationary orbit and on the near-equatorial limb. They also observe occultations of stars to measure molecular oxygen column densities on the limb. Here we describe the algorithms and science data processing that convert downlinked data to spectral-spatial image cubes and occultation spectra, calibrated in geophysical units. These Level 1 data products include disk and near-equatorial limb images of spectra acquired on a 30-min cadence beginning at 06:10 Coordinated Universal Time and ending at 23:10. Nighttime images of the disk, covering regions east of the terminator, begin at 20:10 Coordinated Universal Time and also continue until 00:40 the next day. During the day, some limb images are replaced by time series of stellar spectra that exhibit absorption by molecular oxygen as the star is occulted by the Earth's atmosphere. Instrumental artifacts that occasionally appear in the released data are discussed.",

  "abstract": "Electrons accelerated in the corona during solar activity give rise to radio emission events that can be observed over a wide range of frequencies. Among different finer-scale structures in the dynamic spectra observed in the radio range, fast transients with extents of some milliseconds known as solar radio spikes are observed accompaning the background continuum emission. Fundamental to the generation of radio spikes is a propagating electron beam and following its evolution allows us to understand the physical processes occurring in the solar corona. With the use of a numerical Fokker-Planck code we follow a previous numerical study to simulate the propagation of an electron beam pulse injected in a small region at the top of a magnetic field and outwards the solar corona under typical flare conditions. It was found that in large ambient densities of 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> at the injection point, Coulomb collision effects have an important effect on the propagation of the electrons, causing that the injected electrons thermalize faster in a time of 0.1 and 0.4 s for an electron distribution with a low-energy cut off of 16 and 7 keV respectively and a spectral index of 3. For a tenous ambient medium of density 10<SUP>9</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> thermalization occurs only for an electron distribution with smaller low-energy cut off (7 keV) with a duration of ≈ 1.5 s, while for a larger low-energy cut off (16 keV) the loss of accelerated electrons is very slow, regardles of the spectral index (3 , 7). The electron loss time by Coulomb collisions, which depends on the low boundary ambient density, might be an important parameter that influences the generation of radio spikes due to the formation of instabilities in the corona.",

  "abstract": "Impacts of solar flare vary at different parts of the lower ionosphere depending on it's proximity to the direct exposure of incoming solar radiation. The quantitative analysis of this phenomena can be attributed to `solar zenith angle (χ (t ))' profile over ionosphere. We numerically solve the `electron continuity equation' to obtain the lower ionospheric electron density profile (N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )). The electron production rate (q (t )) is governed by the (i) X-ray profile (ϕ (t )) of the flare, (ii) χ (t )-values during the flare occurrence etc. For analyzing the X-ray profile during flares, we use the GOES-15 satellite observations. Since we're working on electron continuity equation based simplified ionospheric model, we confined our analysis for comparatively stable mid-latitude ionosphere only. We choose three flares each from C, M and X-classes for N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile computation. We observe that temporal N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profiles differ when computed for lower ionosphere over different discrete latitudes. Further, we compute the spatial N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile across mid-latitude at the time when ϕ (t )=ϕ<SUB>m a x</SUB>. Now we assume that, these flares repeat themselves every day of a year (D o Y ) at the same time of a day and we compute N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profiles for each day. We found a seasonal effect on N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile due to solar flare. Further, we investigate the response time delay (Δ t ) of the lower ionosphere, which is the time difference between incidence of X-ray and the respective change in N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profiles during solar flares. Strong seasonal effects on N<SUB>e</SUB>(t )-profile and Δ t are the unique results of this work.",

  "abstract": "A clear understanding of storm-time magnetospheric dynamics is essential for a reliable storm forecasting capability. The dayside magnetospheric response to an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME; dynamic pressure P<SUB>dyn</SUB> &gt; 20 nPa and storm-time index SYM-H &lt; -150 nT) is investigated using in situ OMNI, Geotail, Cluster, MMS, GOES, Van Allen Probes, and THEMIS measurements. The dayside magnetic flux content is directly quantified from in situ magnetic field measurements at different radial distances. The arrival of the ICME, consisting of shock and sheath regions preceding a magnetic cloud, initiated a storm sudden commencement (SSC) phase (SYM-H ~ +50 nT). At SSC, the magnetopause standoff distance was compressed earthward at ICME shock encounter at an average rate ~-10.8 Earth radii per hour for ~10 min, resulting in a rapid 40% reduction in the magnetospheric volume. The \"closed\" magnetic flux content remained constant at 170 ± 30 kWb inside the compressed dayside magnetosphere, even in the presence of dayside reconnection, as evident by an outsized flux transfer event containing 160 MWb. During the storm main and recovery phases, the magnetosphere expanded. The dayside magnetic flux did not remain constant within the expanding magnetosphere (110 ± 30 kWb), resulting in a 35% reduction in pre-storm flux content during the magnetic cloud encounter. At that stage, the magnetospheric magnetic flux was eroded resulting in a weakened dayside magnetospheric field strength at radial distances R ≥ 5 R<SUB>E</SUB>. It is concluded that the inadequate replenishment of the eroded dayside magnetospheric flux during the magnetosphere expansion phase is due to a time lag in storm-time Dungey cycle.",

  "abstract": "This work examines Trouvelot's observations and drawing of an auroral display during the night of 1 March 1872. It is known that the auroral oval moves equatorward to midlatitude and even low latitude during large geomagnetic storms. Trouvelot's graphical record of the great aurora on 1 March 1872 has been often cited as a remarkable example of a midlatitude aurora, although it is puzzling that this apparently occurred on a geomagnetically quiet day. Kataoka et al. (2019, JSWSC, 9, A16) even criticised this as a dating error. Here, we investigate Trouvelot's descriptions and available geomagnetic measurements in detail. Our analysis shows that the original date of Trouvelot's auroral drawing is most probably accurate in local time. Moreover, Trouvelot's descriptions and the observational site show that the auroral visibility fell at the beginning of 2 March 1872 in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Consulting simultaneous variations of magnetograms at Helsinki and Greenwich, we found that the nightside aurora specifically coincides with the initial phase of the storm (substorm) and suggests a close association with a substorm triggered by sudden magnetospheric compression. This case study shows that short geomagnetic storms can be overlooked in a daily aa index and they can also cause midlatitude aurorae. Moreover, we found ≈27-day intervals between this storm, the extreme storms on 4-6 February 1872, and another \"bright aurora\" that was reported on 6 January 1872. Based on their intervals, these midlatitude aurorae have probably resulted from recurrent solar activity.",

  "abstract": "We propose a mechanism for the formation of the horse-collar auroral configuration during periods of strongly northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), invoking the action of dual-lobe reconnection (DLR). Auroral observations are provided by the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite and spacecraft of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). We also use ionospheric flow measurements from DMSP and polar maps of field-aligned currents (FACs) derived from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE). Sunward convection is observed within the dark polar cap, with antisunward flows within the horse-collar auroral region, together with the NBZ FAC distribution expected to be associated with DLR. We suggest that newly closed flux is transported antisunward and to dawn and dusk within the reverse lobe cell convection pattern associated with DLR, causing the polar cap to acquire a teardrop shape and weak auroras to form at high latitudes. Horse-collar auroras are a common feature of the quiet magnetosphere, and this model provides a first understanding of their formation, resolving several outstanding questions regarding the nature of DLR and the magnetospheric structure and dynamics during northward IMF. The model can also provide insights into the trapping of solar wind plasma by the magnetosphere and the formation of a low-latitude boundary layer and cold, dense plasma sheet. We speculate that prolonged DLR could lead to a fully closed magnetosphere, with the formation of horse-collar auroras being an intermediate step.",

  "abstract": "Magnetosheath jets are localized fast flows with enhanced dynamic pressure. When they supermagnetosonically compress the ambient magnetosheath plasma, a bow wave or shock can form ahead of them. Such a bow wave was recently observed to accelerate ions and possibly electrons. The ion acceleration process was previously analyzed, but the electron acceleration process remains largely unexplored. Here we use multipoint observations by Time History of Events and Macroscale during Substorms from three events to determine whether and how magnetosheath jet-driven bow waves can accelerate electrons. We show that when suprathermal electrons in the ambient magnetosheath convect toward a bow wave, some electrons are shock-drift accelerated and reflected toward the ambient magnetosheath and others continue moving downstream of the bow wave resulting in bidirectional motion. Our study indicates that magnetosheath jet-driven bow waves can result in additional energization of suprathermal electrons in the magnetosheath. It implies that magnetosheath jets can increase the efficiency of electron acceleration at planetary bow shocks or other similar astrophysical environments.",

  "abstract": "We present an investigation into the currents within the Jovian magnetodisc using all available spacecraft magnetometer data up until 28 July 2018. Using automated data analysis processes as well as the most recent intrinsic field and current disk geometry models, a full local time coverage of the magnetodisc currents using 7,382 lobe traversals over 39 years is constructed. Our study demonstrates clear local time asymmetries in both the radial and azimuthal height-integrated current densities throughout the current disk. Asymmetries persist within 30 R<SUB>J</SUB> where most models assume axisymmetry. Inward radial currents are found in the previously unmapped dusk and noon sectors. Azimuthal currents are found to be weaker in the dayside magnetosphere than the nightside, in agreement with global magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The divergence of the azimuthal and radial currents indicates that downward field-aligned currents exist within the outer dayside magnetosphere. The presence of azimuthal currents is shown to highly influence the location of the field-aligned currents, which emphasizes the importance of the azimuthal currents in future magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling models. Integrating the divergence of the height-integrated current densities, we find that 1.87 MA R<SUB>J-2</SUB> of return current density required for system closure is absent.",

  "abstract": "This paper describes a short story of how I learned that there is the direct relationship between geomagnetic storms and auroral/magnetospheric substorms in the 1960s and 1970s; in those days, both geomagnetic storms and auroral substorms were almost independent subjects. It is now understood that auroral substorms are directly related to the development of the ring current and thus of the main phase of geomagnetic storms. Further, we have begun to recognize that the growth of the ring current (caused by auroral/magnetospheric substorms) will change the internal structure of the magnetosphere, which in turn will change and could modify at least the intensity of auroral substorms. Thus, there is an interesting feed-back processes between them. It is expected that this feed-back relationship between geomagnetic storms and auroral/magnetospheric substorms will become one of the major issues in magnetospheric physics in the future. In fact, an effort to understand this relationship will deepen our understanding of both geomagnetic storms and auroral/magnetospheric substorms.",

  "abstract": "Auroral arcs and diffuse auroras are common phenomena at high latitudes, though characteristics of their source plasma and fields have not been well understood. We report the first observation of fields and particles including their pitch-angle distributions in the source region of auroral arcs and diffuse auroras, using data from the Arase satellite at L ~ 6.0-6.5. The auroral arcs appeared and expanded both poleward and equatorward at local midnight from ~0308 UT on 11 September 2018 at Nain (magnetic latitude: 66°), Canada, during the expansion phase of a substorm, while diffuse auroras covered the whole sky after 0348 UT. The top part of auroral arcs was characterized by purple/blue emissions. Bidirectional field-aligned electrons with structured energy-time spectra were observed in the source region of auroral arcs, while source electrons became isotropic and less structured in the diffuse auroral region afterwards. We suggest that structured bidirectional electrons at energies below a few keV were caused by upward field-aligned potential differences (upward electric field along geomagnetic field) reaching high altitudes (~30,000 km) above Arase. The bidirectional electrons above a few keV were probably caused by Fermi acceleration associated with the observed field dipolarization. Strong electric-field fluctuations and earthward Poynting flux were observed at the arc crossing and are probably also caused by the field dipolarization. The ions showed time-pitch-angle dispersion caused by mirror reflection. These results indicate a clear contrast between auroral arcs and diffuse auroras in terms of source plasma and fields and generation mechanisms of auroral arcs in the inner magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "Earth's present dipolar magnetic field extends into the interplanetary space and interacts with the solar wind, forming a magnetosphere filled up with charged particles mostly originating from the Earth's atmosphere. In the elongated tail of the magnetosphere, the particles were observed to move either Earthward or tailward at different locations, even outside the Moon's orbit. We hypothesize that the lunar soil, on both the nearside and farside, should have been impacted by these particles during the geological history, and the impact was controlled by the size and morphology of the magnetosphere. We predict that the farside soil could also have the features similar to those in the nearside soil, e.g., <SUP>15</SUP>N-enrichment. Furthermore, we may infer the evolution of the magnetosphere and atmosphere by examining the implanted particles in the lunar soil from both sides. This hypothesis could provide an alternative way to study the evolution of Earth's dynamo and atmosphere.",

The typical flapping period in Mercury's magnetotail is much shorter (~13 s), comparing with ~10-20 min at Earth's magnetotail. The magnetic field oscillation amplitude induced by flapping motion is larger near both flanks than that around tail center. Similar to Earth's magnetotail, there are two flapping types existent in Mercury's magnetotail, one is the kink-like flapping that can propagate as traveling waves, and the other one is the steady flapping that does not propagate. Both flapping types distribute widely in magnetotail. The kink-like flapping waves propagating either dawnward or duskward can be observed across the entire magnetotail current sheet, which suggests that the energy sources for triggering the kink-like flapping waves should locate around both tail flanks instead of tail center as is for the Earth's magnetotail.",

This study is devoted to properties of ULF perturbations generated at the magnetopause, their propagation into the inner magnetosphere, and their modulation of whistler-mode very-low-frequency (VLF) waves. Taking advantage of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission configuration in 2019, we investigate ULF perturbations simultaneously captured by three spacecraft at different distances from the magnetopause. Combining ground-based and THEMIS measurements of ULF perturbations to separate temporal and spatial variations of their properties, we show that their intensity decays exponentially with distance from the magnetopause as close as the geostationary orbit. Near the magnetopause ULF perturbations can modulate whistler-mode (VLF) waves effectively: Close to the magnetopause, VLF wave bursts have the same periodicity as the ULF perturbations. Our results demonstrate that almost the entire outer magnetosphere (from the geostationary orbit to L ∼ 12), including the outer radiation belts, is significantly influenced by ULF perturbations excited by magnetopause dynamic responses to the solar wind.",

  "abstract": "We investigate the relation of fast flows at the inner edge of the plasma sheet to the onset of auroral expansion. Recent work suggests that nearly all expansions are an instability triggered by an auroral streamer from far out in the magnetotail. We investigate an 8-hr interval of activity on 14 March 2008 using ground magnetometer and all-sky camera data to determine the onset times of six substorm expansions. We compare these times with Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms observations of plasma flow and magnetic field. We show that every expansion followed the arrival of a fast flow and dipolarization event at the inner edge of the plasma sheet. To relate the aurora to flows, we develop procedures for removing fixed lights, the moving Moon and its reflection, and contamination due to scattered moonlight. We scan movies of enhanced images for auroral streamers. Three onsets were tentatively associated with streamers. For two, the apparent source was very close to the growth phase arc mapping close to Earth. For one, an onset occurred in the recovery phase of an earlier substorm after a double oval had formed. For this one, the end of an N-S streamer stopped about 2° north of the breakup arc. For the remaining three expansions, no streamers were associated with the onsets. Most substorms exhibit N-S streamers in the recovery phase. These usually cannot be associated with fast flows. Either fast flows in the growth phase do not produce streamers or they make streamers that require significant image enhancement.",

  "abstract": "Pseudosubstorms (pseudobreakups) and substorms are similar phenomena. In terms of auroral morphology, however, the former are not accompanied by poleward expansion, while the latter are. To understand what causes this difference, we studied temporal and spatial development of the near-Earth magnetotail at X=-7 to -11RE around pseudosubstorm and substorm onsets, based on superposed epoch analysis of Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) data. We find that the earthward flow begins to increase at X=-10 to -11RE just before onset and dipolarization for both pseudosubstorms and substorms, possibly due to near-Earth magnetic reconnection or the preceding relaxation of the thin current sheet in a tailward region, but the earthward flow is slower for pseudosubstorms than for substorms. Dipolarization, together with magnetic field fluctuation, is nearly the same at X=-8RE for both cases, but it is weaker at other distances for pseudosubstorms than for substorms. This result suggests that the current disruption related to dipolarization does not expand tailward and hence auroral poleward expansion does not occur for pseudosubstorms. Furthermore, the total pressure is larger at X=-8 to -11RE for several minutes before onset for substorms than for pseudosubstorms. The total pressure gradient increases more largely after onset for substorms than for pseudosubstorms. We suggest that these differences are important factors for determining whether ballooning instability causing current disruption grows in a wide area, that is, whether the initial action develops into a substorm or subsides as a pseudosubstorm.",

  "abstract": "Similar to Earth, Mercury's magnetotail experiences frequent dipolarization of the magnetic field. These rapid (~2 s) increases in the northward component of the tail field (ΔB<SUB>z</SUB> ~ 30 nT) at Mercury are associated with fast sunward flows (~200 km/s) that enhance local magnetic field convection. Differences between the two magnetospheres, namely Mercury's smaller spatiotemporal scales and lack of an ionosphere, influence the dynamics of dipolarizations in these magnetotails. At Earth, the braking of fast dipolarization flows near the inner magnetosphere accumulates magnetic flux and develops the substorm current wedge. At Mercury, flow braking and flux pileup remain open topics. In this work, we develop an automated algorithm to identify dipolarizations, which allows for statistical examination of flow braking and flux pileup in Mercury's magnetotail. We find that near the inner edge of the plasma sheet, steep magnetic pressure gradients cause substantial braking of fast dipolarization flows. The dipolarization frequency and sunward flow speed decrease significantly within a region ~500 km thick located at ~900 km altitude above Mercury's local midnight surface. Due to the close proximity of the braking region to the planet, we estimate that ~10-20% of dipolarizations may reach the nightside surface of the planet. The remaining dipolarizations exhibit prolonged statistical flux pileup within the braking region similar to large-scale dipolarization of Earth's inner magnetosphere. The existence of flow braking and flux pileup at Mercury indicates that a current wedge may form, although the limitations imposed by Mercury's magnetosphere require the braking of multiple, continuous dipolarizations for current wedge formation.",

Further theoretical analyses with GITM were conducted to sperate the influence of ion convection and particle precipitation on the total Joule heating as well as on the resulting large-scale traveling atmospheric disturbances (LSTADs) and LSTIDs. It was found that ion convection and particle precipitation have comparable contributions to the total Joule heating, although the changes of height-integrated Joule heating due to these two forcing terms may display different distributions. In addition, the magnitudes of neutral density and TEC perturbations due to these two forcing terms were found to be comparable. Using the total energy flux versus time derived from all-sky imager measurements for this event to drive GITM improves the data-model comparison of LSTIDs. However, data-model discrepancies still exist in the timing of LSTIDs and the magnitude of TEC perturbations, which calls for further investigation and realistic event-specific specifications.",

  "abstract": "The solar, geomagnetic, gravitational and seismic activities can cause spatial and temporal (hourly, diurnal, seasonal and annual) variabilities of the ionosphere. Main observable ionospheric parameters such as Total Electron Content (TEC) can be used to quantify these. TEC is the total number of electrons on a ray path crossing the atmosphere. The network of world-wide Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provide a cost-effective solution in estimating TEC over a significant proportion of global land mass. This study is focused on the analysis of the variations of ionosphere over a midlatitude region using GPS-TEC estimates for three Sun Spot Numbers (SSN) periods. The investigation is based on a fast and automatic variability detection algorithm, Differential Rate Of TEC (DROT). The algorithm is tested using literature data on disturbances generated by a geomagnetic activity, a Solar Flare, a Medium Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbance (MSTID), a Large Scale TID (LSTID) and an earthquake. Very good agreement with the results in the literature is found. DROT is applied to IONOLAB-TEC estimates from nine Turkish National Permanent GPS Network (TNPGN Active) stations over Turkey to detect the any wave-like oscillations, sudden disturbances and other irregularities during December, March, June, September months for 2010, 2011, 2012 years. It is observed that DROT algorithm is capable of detecting both small and large scale variability due to climatic, gravitational, geomagnetic and solar activities in all layers of ionosphere. The highest DROT values are observed in 2010 during winter months. In higher solar activity years of 2011 and 2012, DROT is able to indicate both seasonal variability and severe changes in ionosphere due to increased number of geomagnetic storms and local seismic activities.",

  "abstract": "The plasmasphere is a critical region of the magnetosphere. It is important for the evolution of Earth's radiation belts. Waves in the plasmasphere interior (hiss) and vicinity (electromagnetic ion cyclotron, chorus) help control the acceleration and loss of radiation belt particles. Thus, understanding the extent, structure, content, and dynamics of the plasmasphere is crucial to understanding radiation belt losses. The Van Allen Probes mission uses two methods to determine the total plasma density. First, the upper hybrid resonance frequency can provide electron density; this determination is the most accurate and robust. However, it requires significant analysis and is challenging during geomagnetically active times: It becomes difficult to interpret the wave spectrum, and the amount of available data is severely limited. Second, the spacecraft potential is a proxy for the plasma density. These high-resolution measurements are available with high duty cycle. However, environmental effects can limit the accuracy of this method. The relation between spacecraft potential and density is empirical, requiring an independent density measurement and repeated checks. We perform a quantitative comparison of these two in situ techniques during the first 3.5 years of the Van Allen Probes mission. We show how to calibrate potential-based density measurements using only publicly available wave-derived densities to provide high-fidelity results even if upper hybrid measurements are sparse or unavailable. We quantify the level of uncertainty to expect from potential-derived density data. Our approach can be applied to any in situ spacecraft mission where reliable absolute density and spacecraft potential data are available.",

  "abstract": "A stable auroral red (SAR) arc is an aurora with a dominant 630 nm emission at subauroral latitudes. SAR arcs have been considered to occur due to the spatial overlap between the plasmasphere and the ring-current ions. In the overlap region, plasmaspheric electrons are heated by ring-current ions or plasma waves, and their energy is then transferred down to the ionosphere where it causes oxygen red emission. However, there have been no study conducted so far that quantitatively examined plasma and electromagnetic fields in the magnetosphere associated with SAR arc. In this paper, we report the first quantitative evaluation of conjugate measurements of a SAR arc observed at 2204 UT on 28 March 2017 and investigate its source region using an all-sky imager at Nyrölä (magnetic latitude: 59.4°N), Finland, and the Arase satellite. The Arase observation shows that the SAR arc appeared in the overlap region between a plasmaspheric plume and the ring-current ions and that electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves and kinetic Alfven waves were not observed above the SAR arc. The SAR arc was located at the ionospheric trough minimum identified from a total electron content map obtained by the GNSS receiver network. The Swarm satellite flying in the ionosphere also passed the SAR arc at ~2320 UT and observed a decrease in electron density and an increase in electron temperature during the SAR-arc crossing. These observations suggest that the heating of plasmaspheric electrons via Coulomb collision with ring-current ions is the most plausible mechanism for the SAR-arc generation.",

  "abstract": "We present a new method for determining the total electron content (TEC) in the Martian ionosphere based on the time delay of received radar pulses of the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) on board the Mars Express spacecraft. Previous studies of the same dataset have produced differing results for the day-side ionosphere, so it is useful to have an alternative way to compute the TEC in this region. This method iterates a model ionosphere in order to simultaneously match the ionospheric delays of the signals received by the radar's two channels by finding the model which minimizes the root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured and simulated delays. Topographical information is obtained from data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument. The model parameters are held constant for a given orbit, and a very good agreement between the simulated and measured delays is obtained. The TEC can then be inverted from the ionospheric model. Matching the delays of both channels simultaneously applies an additional constraint to the model which has not been made in previous studies. The model is additionally validated by matching the simulated pulses with the raw range-compressed measurements for one orbit. Finally, typical model parameters are compared to those obtained by previous studies, which are also simulated. The method is applied to orbits during moderate solar activity, and results show very good agreement with previous studies.",

  "abstract": "The four Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observed energetic (E&gt;50 keV) ion bursts exhibiting an inverse dispersion in the magnetosheath on 28 December 2015. We consider the possibility that these ions originate from the magnetosphere. The ion composition ratios, flux levels, and the spectral slopes of the energetic ion energy spectra observed in the foreshock and in the magnetosheath resemble those in the outer magnetosphere but differ significantly from those seen further upstream from the bow shock at ACE. The particle gyrocenters lie earthward from the spacecraft, indicating that the maximum ion fluxes come from close to the magnetosphere. We provide important evidence that argues against an explanation of the particle source in terms of hot flow anomaly acceleration. A three-dimensional global hybrid simulation shows that escaping magnetospheric ions can be scattered and transported across the magnetosheath. Ground magnetometer observations suggest that a solar wind pressure increase accelerates escaping magnetospheric ions via betatron acceleration, resulting in an inverse energy dispersion in the magnetosheath. However, there are no pressure changes detected on the MMS and ACE spacecraft and the ground magnetic field strength does not appear to be large enough to be consistent with the large magnetospheric compression needed to account for a betatron acceleration. Therefore, we suggest that the inverse energy dispersion event can be explained by a magnetic field rotation that connects MMS to the subsolar magnetosphere, enabling high-energy particles from deep within the inner magnetosphere gain access to the magnetopause and magnetosheath.",

We attribute this asymmetry to the enhanced convection (e.g., more energy in the tail) under IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> &gt; 0 conditions. A superposed epoch analysis of the IMF indicates that the average IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> prior to onset is positive but becomes less positive ~15 min prior to the onset, indicating that the release of the stress associated with a clockwise twisted magnetotail may be an important onset trigger. We conjecture that an asymmetry in the dayside merging efficiency may be the cause.",

  "abstract": "The IS-MST radar, as the name implies, combines two different methods for studying the atmosphere using a backscatter signal. Turbulent fluctuations of the medium cause scattering in the mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST). In the upper atmosphere, incoherent scatter (IS) appears in ionospheric plasma. Special-purpose instruments have been built before such that measurements in one of these modes were the most effective. MST radars were utilized for studying wave activity in the lower and middle atmosphere; the IS radar, for ionospheric research. Nowadays, however, for a comprehensive investigation of atmospheric phenomena, it is necessary to have an idea of processes in all atmospheric layers and near-Earth space. The radar, which combines capabilities of IS and MST measurements, will be able to cover layers from the troposphere to the plasmosphere and to study processes of energy transfer from the lower and middle atmosphere to the ionosphere as well as the interaction of the magnetosphere with the upper atmosphere. Apart from atmospheric research, the radar will allow us to track spacecraft and space debris, determining precise coordinate characteristics. The antenna system is also suitable for radio astronomical observations. In the paper, we provide justification for the 154-162 MHz frequency range and discuss technical solutions of the IS-MST radar project and basic operating modes. In addition, we estimate radar diagnostic capabilities for different types of measurements.",

  "abstract": "Impacts modelers and stakeholders use publicly available data sets of downscaled climate projections to assess and design infrastructure for changes in future rainfall extremes. If differences across data sets exist, infrastructure resilience decisions could change depending on which single data set is used. We assess changes in U.S. rainfall extremes from 2044-2099 compared with 1951-2005 based on 227 projections under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from five widely used data sets. We show there are large differences in the change magnitude and its spatial structure between data sets. At the continental scale, the data sets show different increases, with high-end extremes (e.g. 100-year event) generally increasing more (between 10% and 50%) than low-end extremes (e.g. 5-year). These differences largely contribute to the overall uncertainty for small average recurrence intervals (ARIs) extremes (2- to 10-year), while uncertainties due to short record length dominate large ARIs (25- to 100-year). The results indicate that robust infrastructure planning should consider these uncertainties to enable resilient infrastructure under climate change.",

Here we quantified the contributions of internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty to the ensemble spread of global land monsoon precipitation projections using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). For mean precipitation, model uncertainty (contributing ~90%) dominates the projection uncertainty, while the contribution of internal variability (scenario uncertainty) decreases (increases) with time. The source of uncertainty for extreme precipitation differs from that of mean precipitation mainly in long-term projection, with the contribution of scenario uncertainty comparable to model uncertainty. Reducing model uncertainty can effectively narrow the monsoon precipitation projection. The internal variability estimates differ slightly among models and methods, the uncertainty partitioning is robust in middle-long term.",

Here we examine pressure anisotropic ballooning instabilities in stretched magnetotail geometries. Our results show that transition from an initially perpendicular anisotropy toward parallel anisotropy reduces the plasma β threshold for triggering a ballooning instability. Such increasingly parallel anisotropies can form as a direct consequence of tail stretching that occurs during the late substorm growth phase through the well-known effects of drift shell splitting and the competition between betatron and Fermi processes in the tail. We propose such increasingly parallel ballooning triggers auroral substorm onset on field lines in the transition region between dipolar and tail-like fields, consistent with observational constraints on the location of the onset arc with respect to the ion isotropy boundary in the magnetotail.",

In this short review, we briefly describe both phenomena together on the basis of the chain process. It is shown that the introduction of a dynamo process in this consideration provides a step-by-step way of studying both phenomena. It is shown: (a) Both the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo and a photospheric dynamo proposed by Lee et al. (1995) have enough power to accumulate enough energy for the explosive features of both phenomena, respectively. (b) For substorms, the power is accumulated in the inner magnetosphere and inflates it, and for flares the power is likely to be accumulated in a loop current along and above two-ribbon flares. (c) For substorms, the energy release (unloading) process deflates the inner magnetosphere, resulting in an earthward electric field, and for flares the disruption of the loop current suggested by Alfven (1950) may be responsible for the energy release. (d) The processes in (c) are responsible for the explosive features of both phenomena.",

  "abstract": "Saturn's morningside auroras consist mainly of rotating, transient emission patches, following periodic reconnection in the magnetotail. Simultaneous responses in global energetic neutral atom (ENA) emissions have been observed at similar local times, suggesting a link between the auroras and large-scale injections of hot ions in the outer magnetosphere. In this study, we use Cassini's remote sensing instruments to observe multiple plasma injection signatures within coincident auroral and ENA imagery, captured during 9 April 2014. Kilometric radio emissions also indicate clear injection activity. We track the motion of rotating signatures in the auroras and ENAs to test their local time relationship. Two successive auroral signatures—separated by ~4 hr UT—form postmidnight before rotating to the dayside while moving equatorward. The first has a clear ENA counterpart, maintaining a similar local time mapping throughout ~9 hr observation. Mapping of the ionospheric equatorward motion post-dawn indicates a factor ~5 reduction of the magnetospheric source region's radial speed at a distance of ~14-20 R<SUB>S</SUB>, possibly a plasma or magnetic boundary. The second auroral signature has no clear ENA counterpart; viewing geometry was relatively unchanged, so the ENAs were likely too weak to detect by this time. A third, older injection signature, seen in both auroral and ENA imagery on the nightside, may have been sustained by field-aligned currents linked with the southern planetary period oscillation system, or the re-energization of ENAs around midnight local times. The ENA injection signatures form near magnetic longitudes associated with magnetotail thinning.",

Over the investigated locations, the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes showed positive TEC deviations that were in most cases twice the comparative response level in the Northern Hemisphere on the 8 September 2017. During the storm main phase on 8 September 2017, we have obtained an interesting result of ionosonde maximum electron density of the F2 layer and TEC derived from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations showing different ionospheric responses over the same midlatitude location in the Northern Hemisphere. In situ electron density measurements from SWARM satellite aided by bottomside ionosonde-derived TEC up to the maximum height of the F2 layer (hmF2) revealed that the bottomside and topside ionosphere as well as plasmasphere electron content contributions to overall GNSS-derived TEC were different in both hemispheres especially for 8 September 2017 during the storm main phase. The differences in hemispheric response at conjugate locations and on a regional scale have been explained in terms of seasonal influence on the background electron density coupled with the presence of large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances and low-latitude-associated processes. The major highlight of this study is the simultaneous confirmation of most of the previously observed features and their underlying physical mechanisms during geomagnetic storms through a multi-data set examination of hemispheric differences.",

  "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of the orbital state-vector uncertainty is required for the computation of reliable collision probabilities, the association of tracks, as well as the optimal planning of sensor resources. In low Earth Orbits (LEO) neutral atmospheric density uncertainty is the main contributor to orbital state vector uncertainty. Grid-scale model uncertainty on the other hand is, in most cases, the dominating component of atmospheric density uncertainty. <P />Prior research in the field of density uncertainty has been broad. Nowadays multiple authors seem to agree that a first-order stochastic Gauss-Markov process, also known as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP), is an appropriate stochastic representation for density model uncertainties. While many have studied orbital variations due to stochastic grid-scale density uncertainty, it is believed that the work at hand provides for the first time explicit analytic equations for the estimation of orbital uncertainties due to an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that has been optimized for the representation of atmospheric density. It is shown that the long-term in-track position error due to this modified OUP grows with t<SUP>3</SUP> . <P />The presented derivations and their validation build upon prior work by Emmert et al. and Sagnières and Sharf. Numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to validate the findings with two different semi-empirical density models. We also demonstrate that the resulting orbital uncertainty due to the modified OUP in atmospheric density can be estimated using a classical OUP in the relative density error.",

  "abstract": "Excitation of toroidal mode standing Alfvén waves in the midnight sector of the inner magnetosphere in association with substorms is well documented, but studies are sparse on dayside sources for the waves. This paper reports observation of midnight toroidal waves by the Van Allen Probe B spacecraft during a geomagnetically quiet period on 12-13 May 2013. The spacecraft detected toroidal waves excited at odd harmonics below 30 mHz as it moved within the plasmasphere from ∼2100 magnetic local time to ∼0030 magnetic local time through midnight in the dipole L range 4.2-6.1. The frequencies and the relationship between the electric and magnetic field components of the waves are consistent with theoretical toroidal waves for a reflecting ionosphere. At the time of the nightside toroidal waves, compressional waves were observed by geostationary satellites located on the dayside, and the amplitudes of both types of waves varied with the cone angle of the interplanetary magnetic field. The nightside toroidal waves were likely driven by fast mode waves that resulted from transmission of upstream ultralow frequency waves into the magnetosphere. Ground magnetometers located near the footprint of the spacecraft did not detect toroidal waves.",

  "abstract": "Global circulation models (GCMs) for the ionosphere-thermosphere system traditionally use empirical models to specify upper boundary conditions to represent solar wind and magnetospheric drivers. However, the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere systems are coupled on different spatial and temporal scales. During increased levels of geomagnetic activity, these empirical models can't resolve dynamic electric field variability (&lt;500 km, &lt;15 min) because of their statistical nature and/or low spatial and temporal resolutions. This results in an underestimation of energy input to the ionosphere, causing disagreements between model results and observations. This paper introduces a new framework to incorporate dynamic electric fields into GCMs: High-latitude Input for Mesoscale Electrodynamics (HIME). As a demonstration HIME uses the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) electric field estimates during an experiment on 2 March 2017. The electric potentials were calculated using the PFISR estimates and merged with a global empirical model of electric potential. A set of high-latitude electric potential drivers were used to drive the University of Michigan Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) to understand the effects of driving at different scales. Data versus model comparisons for ion temperature, electron temperature, and electron density are provided along the PFISR beams. The ion convection velocities and neutral winds at the PFISR location are compared with the PFISR and Scanning Doppler Imager data. The effects of different multiscale drivers are investigated. The results showed that energy deposited by HIME-driven simulations was locally larger by approximately an order of magnitude compared to the empirical model-driven results.",

  "abstract": "One near-ubiquitous signature of substorms observed on the ground is the azimuthal structuring of the onset auroral arc in the minutes prior to onset. Termed auroral beads, these optical signatures correspond to concurrent exponential increases in ground ultralow frequency (ULF) wave power and are likely the result of a plasma instability in the magnetosphere. Here, we present a case study showing the development of auroral beads from a Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky camera with near simultaneous exponential increases in auroral brightness, ionospheric and conjugate magnetotail ULF wave power, evidencing their intrinsic link. We further present a survey of magnetic field fluctuations in the magnetotail around substorm onset. We find remarkably similar superposed epoch analyses of ULF power around substorm onset from space and conjugate ionospheric observations. Examining periods of exponential wave growth, we find the ground- and space-based observations to be consistent, with average growth rates of ∼0.01 s<SUP>-1</SUP>, lasting for ∼4 min. Cross-correlation suggests that the space-based observations lead those on the ground by approximately 1-1.5 min. Meanwhile, spacecraft located premidnight and ∼10 R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail are more likely to observe enhanced wave power. These combined observations lead us to conclude that there is a magnetospheric counterpart of auroral beads and exponentially increasing ground ULF wave power. This is likely the result of the linear phase of a magnetospheric instability, active in the magnetotail for several minutes prior to auroral breakup.",

  "abstract": "Two-dimensional thermospheric wind fields, at both E and F region altitudes within a common vertical volume, were made using a Scanning Doppler Imager (SDI) at Poker Flat, Alaska, during a substorm event. Coinciding with these observations were F region plasma velocity measurements from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and estimations of the total downward and upward field-aligned current density from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE). This combination of instruments gives an excellent opportunity to examine the spatial characteristics of high-latitude ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and how a process which is triggered in the magnetosphere (the substorm) affects that coupling at different altitudes. We find that during the substorm growth phase, the F region thermospheric winds respond readily to an expanding ionospheric plasma convection pattern, while the E region winds appear to take a much longer period of time. The differing response timescales of the E and F region winds are likely due to differences in neutral density at those altitudes, resulting in E region neutrals being much more \"sluggish\" with regard to ion drag. We also observe increases in the F region neutral temperature, associated with neutral winds accelerating during both substorm growth and recovery phases.",

The polar stratosphere temperature and planetary wave (PW) enhancements are found to be unusual from the history for 40 years; hence, it is an \"Extremely-Rare\" SSW. The distinct features of the mesosphere winds were observed during the SSW, in association with the traveling PWs in the stratosphere. The mesosphere zonal winds reversed for about 20 days before the peak SSW. Meteor radar (MR) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)-2 observations indicate that the zonal wind reversal was descended with time, and the reversal was larger over ~72°S than the MR site (62°S). The MR detected the PWs of 14-22 days before and 8-12 days following the SSW in the mesosphere. We further noticed the enhancement of wavenumber 1 signature in the mesosphere during the peak SSW over the polar region. Thus, the polar middle-atmosphere is greatly affected by the SSW.",

  "abstract": "Recent observations in the nightside inner magnetosphere have identified a series of wedge-like spectral structures in the energy-time spectrograms of oxygen, helium, and hydrogen ion fluxes. Although the shapes and distributions of these structures have been characterized by case and statistical studies, their formation mechanism remains unclear. Here we utilize a particle tracing model to reproduce the wedge-like structures successively observed by the twin Van Allen Probes. The model suggests that these structures originate from intermittent substorm injection, and it is the accessibility region of these injected ions that determines their shapes. This mechanism is similar to the formation of another kind of structures, the inner magnetospheric nose-like structures, except that the wedge-like structures are separated from the tail population by the discontinuation of ion injections. This scenario is also supported by the distribution statistics of wedge-like structures, which provides new insights into the dynamics of the magnetotail-inner magnetosphere coupled system.",

  "abstract": "Titan's magnetic environment is a dynamic and unique place. We detect 85 flux ropes during all the Cassini flybys of Titan from 2005-2017. Analysis describing the location of flux ropes in Titan's ionosphere as well as where Titan is in Saturn's magnetosphere shows that the flux ropes are more often found when Titan is in the noon sector of Saturn's magnetosphere. A secondary peak of occurrence is found in the postmidnight area, where it is expected that Saturn's magnetosphere is highly dynamic. We also find that the flux rope occurrence is correlated with the average electron density profile of Titan's ionosphere. A force-free model is utilized to estimate the radii and core magnetic field strength of the flux ropes. We find a large range of radii from 150-500 km with a small number of very large flux ropes (500-1,000 km) and a range of core field strengths of 1-15 nT, again with some much larger values(20-40 nT). The model also shows that more flux ropes are right-handed than left-handed in twist; however, we are unable to determine if there is a physical reason or if this is due to an observer bias. Additionally, we evaluate the goodness of fit for the model in each instance and conclude that, on average, the flux ropes may be better represented by a non-force-free model.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, a tube-based robust output feedback model predictive control method (TRMPC) is proposed for controlling chaser spacecraft docking with a tumbling target in near-circular orbit. The controller contains a simple, stable, Luenberger state estimator and a tube-based robust model predictive controller. Several practical challenges are also considered under dock-enabling conditions, such as the control saturation, velocity constraint, approach corridor constraint, and collision avoidance constraint. Meanwhile, uncertainties are carefully analyzed when designing the controller, including dynamics uncertainty, measurement error, and control deviation. The TRMPC ensures that all possible state trajectories with uncertainties lie in the minimum robust positively invariant set (mRPI, i.e., the so-called tube in this paper). The tube center is the solution of a nominal (without uncertainties) system. Another important contribution of this paper is to propose a technique where it is unnecessary to calculate the mRPI explicitly. Thereby, the 'curse of dimensionality' can be avoided for a six-dimensional system. To verify the feasibility of the proposed TRMPC strategy in the presence of uncertainties, two scenarios of autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&amp;D) are simulated. The simulation results show that the TRMPC method is more efficient in minimizing the uncertainties, fuel consumption, and computational cost, compared to the classic model predictive control (MPC) method.",

Its effect in the thermosphere over South America was imaged from geostationary orbit by NASA's Global-scale Observation of Limb and Disk (GOLD) instrument. GOLD observed a large brightness reduction (&gt;80% around totality) in OI 135.6 nm and N<SUB>2</SUB> LBH band emissions compared to baseline measurements made 2 days prior. In addition, a significant enhancement (with respect to the baseline) in the ΣO/N<SUB>2</SUB> column density ratio (~80%) was observed within the eclipse's totality. This enhancement suggests that the eclipse induced compositional changes in the thermosphere. After the eclipse passed, a slight enhancement in ΣO/N<SUB>2</SUB> column density ratio (~7%) was also seen around the totality path when compared to measurements before the eclipse. These observations are the first synoptic imaging measurements of an eclipse's thermospheric effects with the potential to drastically improve and test our understanding of how the thermosphere responds to rapid, localized changes in solar short wavelength radiation.",

The Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) far-ultraviolet imaging spectrometer is able to observe the middle thermosphere from geostationary orbit. During October 2018, a special observational campaign was performed, designed to identify atmospheric waves.

  "abstract": "This work presents particle-based kinetic simulations of ion thruster plasma plumes, in an analysis of the modified spacecraft charged drag profile, resultant of plume interactions with the ambient thermosphere/ionosphere in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO). VLEO is a highly appealing region for spacecraft operations, as it offers high-performing economical spacecraft platforms, but the mission lifetime is very limited owing to high drag from the residual atmosphere. Detailed characterisation of plume dynamics is vital in exploring the feasibility of Electric Propulsion (EP) as a means of continuous drag compensation at such altitudes. Quasi-neutral Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo - Particle-in-Cell simulations, involving interactions of ion thruster plumes with rarefied ambient thermosphere/ionosphere, are presented for steady drag-compensating thruster firings in orbits of 150 and 400 km. It is shown that the flow profile is affected by a combination of collisional and indirect electrostatic field mechanisms. In the immediate aft region of the spacecraft, the interaction is driven by pick-up of freestream ions within the charge-exchange cloud. The main effect of the plume is to simply deflect the freestream, as ionosphere particles collide with primary beam propellant, and the freestream number density increases at the spacecraft trailing edge as particles are captured at the charge-exchange cloud. The consequences of the observed mechanisms on the spacecraft drag are theorised, and it is shown that effects of EP plume plasma in VLEO should be included in future analyses, to ensure drag models are complete.",

The EIA structures in the OI-135.6 nm emission over the American landmass resemble, spatially and temporally, those observed in the GNSS-TEC maps. The early morning EIA (EM-EIA) crests are well separated in latitude and mostly located over the middle of South America during October-November. In February-April the crests are less separated in latitude and predominantly located over the west coast sector of South America. Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) simulations with constant solar minimum and quiet-geomagnetic conditions show that EM-EIA can occur globally and shows properties similar to longitudinal Wave 4 pattern.

  "abstract": "In addition to existing empirical models describing the average distributions of energetic electron precipitation into the auroral ionosphere at different activity levels, we develop and test a semiempirical approach to construct dynamical models describing the recurrent features of spatiotemporal development of auroral absorption in the ionosphere during individual substorms. Its key ingredients are (a) usage of linear prediction filter technique to extract from riometer data the response function to the injection of unit magnitude and (b) characterization of injection parameters by midlatitude magnetic variations caused by the substorm current wedge. Using global riometer network we test the method performance for stations in the middle of auroral zone (at corrected geomagnetic latitudes of 65-67°) where generally the absorption amplitude is largest. In this paper we use the midlatitude positive bay index, recently developed by X. Chu and R. McPherron, to drive the model. We evaluate the model performance, discuss the dynamical properties of energetic electron precipitation as revealed by the linear prediction filter response function analyses, and finally, we discuss possible future improvements of this method intended for both science and applications.",

  "abstract": "Electromagnetic energy carried by magnetohydrodynamic modes is an important mechanism in the energy transfer between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. Alfvén waves are known to carry field-aligned currents and thus play an important role in the dynamics of the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling. The role of Hall conductance in this interplay has been explored in magnetohydrodynamic models of the ionosphere but has hitherto not been observed in situ. We use 5 years of observations from the Swarm mission to shed light on this interplay. We present a high-latitude climatology of both the measured Poynting flux and the measured Alfvén wave reflection coefficient. Our results indicate that high-energy precipitation, which penetrates deep into the ionosphere and directly leads to strongly enhanced Hall conductance, is an important cause of positively interfering Alfvén wave reflection. We present such observational evidence and, with that, suggest that Hall conductance is substantially more important in the ionospheric wave reflection climatology than hitherto believed.",

  "abstract": "The onset of substorms is associated with bursty enhancements of Alfvén wave power throughout the magnetotail. While impossible to assess the total Alfvén wave power in the entire magnetotail, we have instead monitored waves that are funneled into the auroral acceleration region, in order to assess the temporal evolution of Alfvén wave power above the nightside auroral zone in relation to substorm phases. The substorms were grouped by three conditions: nonstorm periods, storm periods, and all (unconditioned) periods. Using superposed epoch analysis, we found that the global magnetohydrodynamic Alfvén wave power increased significantly at onset for all three conditions, while a power decrease to preonset values occurred within 2 hr. Specifically, the peak inflowing power during the expansion phase was 5.7 GW for unconditioned substorms, 5.6 GW for nonstorm-time substorms, and 7.8 GW for storm-time substorms. These results correspond to power increases with respect to preonset values of 138%, 366%, and 200%, respectively. Additional analysis in relation to the aurora was performed for nonstorm-time substorms only. During the expansion phase, about 50% of the Alfvén wave power over the entire nightside auroral zone is collocated with the auroral bulge region. Furthermore, the total inflowing Alfvén wave power over the entire nightside auroral zone is 17% of the conjugate auroral power, while the inflowing power over the auroral bulge region is 32% of the conjugate aurora. However, allowing for a finite absorption efficiency inside the auroral acceleration region, the likely average Alfvénic contributions to the aurora are approximately 10% and 18%, respectively.",

We perform three test simulations for the Northern Hemisphere winter conditions in order to assess the effects of variations in the initial GW spectrum on the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. We find that the overall strength of the source level momentum flux has a relatively small impact on the zonal mean dynamics. The tails of the GW source level spectrum, however, are crucial for the lower thermosphere dynamics. With respect to the terdiurnal tide, we find a strong dependence of tidal amplitude on the induced GW drag, generally being larger when GW drag is increased.",

  "abstract": "This study presents the continuation of our previous analysis of variations of atmospheric and space weather parameters above Iberian Peninsula along two years near the 24th solar cycle maximum. In the previous paper (Morozova et al., 2017) we mainly discussed the first mode of principal component analysis of tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature and pressure fields, which was shown to be correlated with lower stratospheric ozone and anti-correlated with cosmic ray flux. Now we extend the investigation to the second mode, which suggests a coupling between the stratosphere and the ionosphere. <P />This second mode, located in the low and middle stratosphere (and explaining ~7% of temperature and ~3% of geopotential height variations), showed to be statistically significantly correlated with variations of the middle stratosphere ozone content and anti-correlated with variations of ionospheric total electron content. Similar co-variability of these stratospheric and ionospheric parameters was also obtained with the wavelet cross-coherence analysis. <P />To investigate the role of atmospheric circulation dynamics and the causal nature of the found correlations, we applied the convergent cross mapping (CCM) analysis to our series. Strong evidence for the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling were obtained for the winter 2012-2013 that is characterized by the easterly QBO phase (quasi-biennial oscillations of the direction of the stratospheric zonal winds) and a strong SSW (sudden stratospheric warming event). Further analysis (for the three-year time interval 2012-2015) hint that SSWs events play main role in emphasizing the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

  "abstract": "We ran the IRAP Plasmasphere Ionosphere Model (IPIM) for several flux tubes at different distances from Earth for very quiet conditions, in order to model the convection and corotation transport of closed flux tubes in the plasmasphere for tilted/eccentric dipolar magnetic field configuration and for solstice and equinox conditions. For each simulation, the model was run for 30 days in order to study the long-term evolution of the plasmasphere-ionosphere system. The goal is to study the combined effect of corotation and convection, which causes eventually a lag of the flux tube motion with respect to the Earth. This combination of nonuniform rotation and subcorotation in average becomes important especially in the outer plasmasphere and causes nonuniform drift of the dipole tilt projection in the plane of the flux tube with time, changing drastically the plasma distribution along this flux tube. In the classical representation of the plasmasphere, the ionosphere only depends on angular Magnetic Local Time (MLT) sector. We show that due to the tilt effect, solar illumination along the flux tube and field-aligned transport varies from one day to the other and causes also a day-to-day variation in the plasma distribution along the tube. This effect implies that a stable representation of the plasmasphere in MLT during quiet conditions is an erroneous view, and no real dynamic equilibrium can be reached, in particular close to the stagnation point.",

  "abstract": "Although the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral ionosphere contains interesting dynamic phenomena that may significantly impact the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system, it has been much less studied than the dusk-to-premidnight sector. We discuss a dynamic phenomenon in the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral oval, eastward fast flows mainly within the expanse of the Region 1 current (its part equatorward of the polar cap). These flows peak and have a steep speed gradient (increase from low to high latitude) near the interface between the Region 1 and Region 2 currents. Because such flows correspond to an electric field that most likely comes from enhanced Region 2 currents and an associated spatial conductivity gradient, their generation mechanism is analogous to that of a subauroral polarization stream. Therefore, we refer to such an eastward flow as a dawnside auroral polarization stream (DAPS). We show several examples of the presence and absence of DAPS under different geomagnetic activity levels. A DAPS' electric field can heat the ionosphere (and thus the thermosphere), change the convection pattern of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and modify the drift path of magnetospheric particles. Because a DAPS' flow peak maps to a major site of magnetic-kinetic energy conversion in the magnetosphere (the transition region between dipole and stretched field), it may be important for the conversion. A DAPS' steep flow gradient is also potentially important; it may lead to instabilities, such as that responsible for auroral Omega bands. Given its potential importance, knowledge of DAPS is fundamental for understanding the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system.",

Previous modeling studies have shown that outflowing ionospheric ions may induce magnetospheric sawtooth oscillations through mass loading of the magnetotail, stretching the magnetic field lines, and reducing nightside reconnection. The spatial distribution of polar cap outflow in these simulation studies produces significant outflow in the auroral oval and lacks a distinct cusp source. Thus, the question arises whether cusp outflow can induce sawtooth oscillations. We show controlled numerical experiments with magnetospheric sawtooth oscillations induced by an idealized cusp outflow for driving conditions representative of the interaction of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection with Earth's magnetosphere. The analysis shows that although only a small portion (10%) of the cusp outflow is entrained within the plasma sheet, it is effective in inducing magnetospheric sawtooth oscillations, similar to previous experiments.",

  "abstract": "Auroral emissions reflect energy dissipation in the atmosphere, while the energy mostly originates from the magnetospheric dynamics of the planet. In the Earth's magnetosphere, the interaction between the solar wind and the terrestrial magnetic field produces magnetic reconnection ultimately causing the appearance of auroras in the polar regions. In this study, we revisit two reconnection events previously identified using ESA Cluster observations during conditions of moderate geomagnetic activity, in the magnetotail. We compare these in situ detections with simultaneous global auroral images from the NASA-IMAGE satellite and ionospheric convection measurements from SuperDARN. We show for the first time a direct correspondence between the electric voltage estimated at ionospheric altitude and the reconnection rate at the reconnection site. We compute the total auroral precipitation power and compare it to the energy released from the reconnection site. We deduce that the precipitated electron power of the aurora and the electron energy deposition rate from the reconnection site are of the same order of magnitude, which means that the thermal energy released by reconnection is primarily transferred to the ionosphere and contributes to the auroral activity.",

  "abstract": "Detailed properties of the spatially periodic auroral beads (ABs) that develop immediately prior to auroral substorm expansion onset on breakup auroral arcs pose stringent observational constraints on the substorm onset process. Theoretical predictions of the cross-field current instability (CCI) are evaluated in terms of these constraints. It is found that CCI satisfies these constraints associated with ABs, that is, their growth rates, wavelengths, and periods, by matching these characteristics well with the theoretical predictions of CCI. Several subtle trends in AB properties are revealed with CCI solutions applied to them. For a given observed wavelength in the ionosphere, waves with longer periods are generated at onset sites at longer downstream distances for both westward and eastward drifting ABs. Waves with higher growth rates are generated by higher drift speeds for a given observed period and for a given observed wavelength by onset sites at closer downstream distances. A distinct group of eastward drifting ABs having long periods and small wavelengths are related to onset sites with relatively high drift speeds and large downstream distances. These revelations indicate that the onset site can occur over a range of downstream distances. ABs possessing two different propagating directions may be accommodated. A two-dimensional equilibrium current sheet can be constructed from the adopted parameters for the current sheet used in CCI solution. Some misunderstandings of CCI are clarified as well. All these findings provide strong evidence for CCI as a viable substorm onset process.",

  "abstract": "We study the Pi3 pulsations (with a period T=15-30 min) that were recorded on December 8, 2017 at ground stations in the midnight sector of the magnetosphere at the latitude range of DP2 current system convective electrojets. We have found that Pi3 are especially pronounced in the pre-midnight sector with amplitude of up to 300 nT and duration of up to 2.5 hrs. The pulsation amplitude rapidly decreased with decreasing latitude from F'=72° to F'=63°. The event was recorded during the steady magnetospheric convection. In the southward Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field, irregular oscillations were detected in the Pi3 frequency range. They correspond to slow magnetosonic waves occurring without noticeable variations in the dynamic pressure Pd. Ground-based geomagnetic observations have shown azimuthal propagation of pulsations with a 0.6-10.6 km/s velocity east and west of the midnight meridian. An analysis of the dynamics of pulsations along the meridian has revealed their propagation to the equator at a velocity 0.75-7.87 km/s. In the projection onto the magnetosphere, the velocities are close in magnitude to the observed propagation velocities of substorm injected electrons. In the dawn-side magnetosphere during ground-observed Pi3 pulsations, compression mode oscillations were recorded. We conclude that propagation of geomagnetic field oscillations in this event depends on the dynamics of particle injections under the action of a large-scale electric field of magnetospheric convection, which causes the plasma to move to Earth due to reconnection in the magnetotail. Small-scale oscillations in the magnetosphere were secondary, excited by the solar wind oscillations penetrating into the magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "The admissible region method provides a reliable orbit initialization framework for space objects with extremely limited observations. In general, the uncertainty of the admissible region is either ignored or treated as a probability distribution. However, the probabilistic characterization requires that one possess exact knowledge of the distribution of all random errors, e.g., the observation process, the constraint parameters, and the observer related information, which may not be available in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we explore the use of Outer Probability Measure (OPM) theory to achieve a more truthful characterization of the uncertainty of the admissible region, dubbed the Possibilistic Admissible Region (PAR+). Considering that the uncertainty of the constraints is epistemic and modeled by possibility functions, a rigorous possibilistic uncertainty representation is achieved without the need of known random statistics of the system. To wit, the method presented herein can be appropriately interpreted as initializing our inference of a dynamical system with a so-called uninformative prior. The developed PAR+ models the uncertainty of the admissible region as an OPM represented by a collection of particles. It provides a method for space object tracking in the presence of assumed ignorance and unknown randomness (i.e. uninformative prior). The PAR+ for the commonly used angles-only and radar measurements are developed and illustrated using simulated scenarios.",

The coupling of clearance joint and parameter uncertainty, therefore, would further significantly influence the kinematic accuracy and dynamic response of a space robot manipulator. In this paper, the dynamic performance of space robot manipulator with consideration of joint clearance and parameter uncertainty is analyzed. Quantification of parameter effect on the dynamic response is also presented. In the analysis, joint elements are modelled as colliding bodies, where the nonlinear contact force model and hybrid friction model are employed to describe the impact-contact phenomena. Motion equations of the mechanism are derived in which nonlinear forces are considered as external forces. Then, the Chebyshev polynomial method is introduced to explicate the relation between the mechanism response and parameters. Based on the Chebyshev polynomial method, dynamic response of the uncertain mechanism could be calculated through the use of interval algorithm, and a sensitivity analysis method is introduced to quantify the parameter effect. The dynamics of a space robot manipulator with joint clearance and parameter uncertainty is further investigated, where the clearance size and friction coefficients are taken as single and multiple uncertain parameters, and effects of the uncertainties on the manipulator response are quantified. This study could help for the design, analysis and test of a space robot manipulator with consideration of both clearance and uncertainty.",

Since these photographs do not have accurate time and geographical information, in order to use them as scientific data, it is necessary to calibrate the imaging parameters (such as looking direction and angle of view of the camera) of the photographs. For this purpose, we calibrated the imaging parameters using a city light image taken from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite following the method of Hozumi et al.

We mapped the photographs onto the geographic coordinate system using the calibrated imaging parameters. To evaluate the accuracy of the mapping, we compared the aurora taken simultaneously from ISS and ground. Comparing the spatial structure of discrete aurora and the temporal variation of pulsating aurora, the accuracy of the data set is less than 0.3 s in time and less than 5 km in space in the direction perpendicular to the looking direction of the camera. The generated data set has a wide field of view (∼1,100 × 900 km), and their temporal resolution is less than 1 s. Not only that, the field of view can sweep a wide area (∼3,000 km in longitude) in a short time (∼10 min). Thus, this new imaging capability will enable us to capture the evolution of fine-scale spatial structure of aurora in a wide area.",

  "abstract": "In this work, we evaluated the quasi-realistic ionosphere forecasting capability by an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as the background model in the system. The slant total electron contents (TECs) from global International Global Navigation Satellite Systems Service ground-based receivers and from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate are assimilated into the system, and the ionosphere is then predicted in advance during the quiet interval of 23 to 27 March 2010. The predicted ionosphere vertical TEC (VTEC) and the critical frequency foF<SUB>2</SUB> are validated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology VTEC and global ionosondes network, respectively. We found that the ionosphere forecast quality could be enhanced by optimizing the thermospheric neutral components via the EnKF method. The ionosphere electron density forecast accuracy can be improved by at least 10% for 24 hr. Furthermore, the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics/Global Ultraviolet Imager (TIMED/GUVI) [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] observations are used to validate the predicted thermosphere [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>]. The validation shows that the [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] optimized by EnKF has better agreement with the TIMED/GUVI observation. This study further demonstrates the validity of EnKF in enhancing the ionospheric forecast capability in addition to our previous observing system simulation experiments by He et al.

  "abstract": "An understanding of ionospheric conductances is important for models of large-scale dynamics in the Earth's magnetosphere. We parameterize height-integrated Pedersen and Hall conductances in the ionosphere, derived from images of auroral emissions obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Programme low-altitude orbiting spacecraft, under different interplanetary and solar wind conditions. For the dayside, conductances are parameterized by interplanetary magnetic field clock angle and magnitude, and by season. These dayside conductances are compared to distributions of field-aligned currents determined from measurements of the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamic Response Experiment. We use these currents to spatially determine a return flow region. We find that the return flow regions exhibit marginally larger conductances than those observed in the polar cap. Conductances in summer exceed those in winter for both the return flow and polar cap regions, on average by a factor of 1.2. On the nightside, we track changes in height-integrated conductance across the Southern Hemisphere polar regions during an average substorm, following a substorm onset list derived from the SuperMAG database. Mean conductances peak approximately 0.75 hr after substorm onset, with maximum conductances seen in the 23 hr magnetic local time sector.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effects of the solar activity phases on the magnetospheric processes in relation to daily relativistic electron (E &gt;2 MeV) dynamics at geosynchronous orbit (GEO) during Solar Cycles 23-24. GOES observations indicate that in the descending phase the electron fluxes are seasonally dependent with largest flux in equinoctial periods, relatively high, and 27-day recurrent, while in the maximum phases they are relatively low and nonrecurrent. The electron fluxes are relatively low and partially recurrent in the ascending phases. The cross correlation coefficients (c.c.s) of daily K<SUB>p</SUB>-V<SUB>sw</SUB>, K<SUB>p</SUB>-A E , K<SUB>p</SUB>-A L evolve in the similar trend for both solar cycles: highest during the descending phases, lower in the ascending phases, and lowest in the maximum and minimum phases. The correlation of K<SUB>p</SUB>-viscous term is strongest during descending phases and weakest around the maximum phases. The correlation of K<SUB>p</SUB>-merging term slightly varies in a chaotic way from one solar phase to another, but drops to its lowest value in the solar minimum. The correlation analysis results signify the role of the solar activity in controlling the solar wind-magnetosphere couplings. Two case studies during maximum (2000) and descending (2017) phases indicate that the solar activity dependence of the magnetospheric processes and relativistic electrons is characterized by substorm activity and solar wind drivers. Most of the substorms induced by coronal mass ejections in the maximum phase exhibit strong but short and non-repetitive features that associate with low electron fluxes at GEO. In contrast, high intensity, prolonged, and repetitive substorm activities induced by high-speed solar winds are the main cause of the relativistic electron enhancements during the descending phases. The enhancements strongly depend on V<SUB>sw</SUB> and Σ K<SUB>p</SUB> in which only appropriate V<SUB>sw</SUB> and Σ K<SUB>p</SUB> are required. In the descending phase, the requirements for the flux enhancements to ≥10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> are the simultaneity of V<SUB>sw</SUB>&gt;500 km/s and the prolongation of Σ K<SUB>p</SUB>&gt;220 and to ≥10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> when V<SUB>sw</SUB>≥630 km/s and Σ K<SUB>p</SUB>&gt;227 . Furthermore, the correlations of Σ K<SUB>p</SUB> and log-electron fluxes are stronger in the descending/ascending phases than in the maximum phase, while the time lag between them is longer in the maximum phase. The remarkable correlations of V<SUB>sw</SUB>-K<SUB>p</SUB> and in the descending phase indicate appropriate magnetospheric convection in association with the repetitive substorms that can effectively trigger the stochastic mechanisms of electron acceleration. The results are extensively discussed in the light of observations and current theories of radiation belt dynamics.",

  "abstract": "Developing a computational model for aurora image classification is an important task for polar research. However, the design of the handcrafted features in the traditional methods has insufficient descriptive ability for auroral morphology and is dependent on expert knowledge. In this paper, an automatic aurora image classification framework based on deep learning is proposed to solve the problem. In this framework, three basic deep learning networks—AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet—are used to automatically classify all-sky aurora images via convolution and pooling processes and a back-propagation mechanism, without requiring manual intervention. As shown in the class activation mapping (CAM), the proposed framework can extract the complex auroral feature representations automatically and discriminatively. The results obtained with all-sky aurora images from the Yellow River Station demonstrate that the proposed framework has effective transfer ability and can achieve real-time classification. It is also shown that the proposed method can achieve higher average classification accuracy than the AI-MFLDA method. The statistical auroral occurrence distribution can be obtained based on the classification results. There are dominant morphological characteristics in the four magnetic local time (MLT) regions of the dayside aurora oval, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

  "abstract": "We present a statistical study of the ion upflow associated with subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) in the ionospheric subauroral region at different substorm times using three Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite (F16-F18) data for five years (2010-2014) in the Northern Hemisphere. The results show similarities between SAPS and the ion upflow at different intensity of substorms both in occurrence rate distribution and velocity distribution. In comparison to SAPS, the distribution of the ion upflow shows the smaller occurrence region and lower velocity. We also find that frictional heating plays an important role in ion upflow from the SAPS region. The intense substorms can trigger strong SAPS channels, enhanced frictional heating, and large ion upflow. In addition, there is a moderate linear correlation between SAPS velocity and field-aligned velocity that is consistent with some previous findings. Our results also show that frictional heating can gradually dominate the ion upflow process in intense substorms, while it may not be the only factor to affect the whole upflow process.",

  "abstract": "Projections of extreme precipitation are of considerable interest in a range of design and management applications. These projections, however, can exhibit uncertainty that requires quantification to provide confidence to any application they are used in. This study assesses the uncertainty in projected extreme daily precipitation, separated into model, scenario, and ensemble components using the square root error variance (SREV) rationale. For this, 45 projections of daily precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are used, consisting of multiple global circulation models and their ensemble members, for a range of Representative Concentration Pathways, allowing assessment across land-covered areas worldwide. It is found that the uncertainty in dry regions is significantly higher compared to wet regions, raising concerns regarding infrastructure design for the future in arid parts of the world. It is also found that the climate scenarios and initialization contribute significantly to the overall uncertainty, compared to contributions for more nonextreme precipitation simulations. This finding has implications in how design precipitation extremes ought to be projected into the future, with greater attention being paid on a broader selection of emission scenarios and initializations than is the case with projections of nonextreme precipitations.",

  "abstract": "Multispacecraft observations of the magnetosheath responses to various foreshock transients in a single event on 17 March 2004 are reported in this paper. The Cluster spacecraft recorded long-standing large amplitude ULF waves with both compressive and transverse components in the magnetosheath. Additionally, two transient structures with depressions in density and magnetic field were observed in this period. One structure contains greatly heated and significantly deflected plasmas in the middle and a cold solar wind population at its trailing edge, which is identified as a spontaneous hot flow anomaly with a remnant of the foreshock caviton. It is transmitted through the magneosheath and evolved into a magnetosheath cavity. This cavity was subsequently encountered by the Double Star TC-1 spacecraft deeper inside the magnetosheath. Meantime, fluxes of hot ions in the energy range of 5-38 keV exhibit quasiperiodic variations. These energetic ions are earthward with pitch angle distributions of alternately field aligned or antifield aligned. A correlation between its flux variations and the transverse fluctuations of the ULF waves is found. Moreover, magnetosheath filamentary structures with a series of anticorrelated oscillations of density and temperature were observed simultaneously.",

  "abstract": "The low-latitude ionospheric TEC observed by the Beidou geostationary satellite showed large enhancement during 27-30 August 2018 of the storm recovery phase. The cause of the positive ionospheric storm during the recovery phase has yet to be resolved. In this study, multiple observations, including aurora, high-latitude convection, potential, and the TEC maps, were used to study the contributions from the high-speed solar wind to the ionosphere during the recovery phase of the storm. It was found that the high-speed solar wind was effective in modulating the intensity and the size of the auroral oval, high-latitude convection, and potential pattern. The Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model generally reproduced the observed evolution of the ionosphere at high latitudes during the recovery phase of the storm, and it was used to quantitatively investigate the effects of the high-speed solar wind on the recovery phase ionosphere. The results suggested that the high-speed solar wind caused increase of TEC at auroral oval was about 2 TECU. The high-speed solar wind, combined with oscillating interplanetary magnetic field Bz, led to the enhancement of the low-latitude prompt penetrating electric fields and increased the low-latitude TEC of about 2 TECU. Therefore, the high-speed solar wind was a possible driver to the ionospheric positive storm during the recovery phase, but the causes for the more than 10-TECU enhancement at low and middle latitudes during the recovery phase of this event are unknown.",

  "abstract": "Whistler and electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonics waves are responsible for scattering and precipitating the energetic plasma sheet electrons that drive the diffuse aurora. These primary electrons with energies in the kiloelectron volt range, simultaneously precipitating in magnetically conjugate regions, produce the secondary electron population and can be reflected by the atmosphere back through the magnetosphere and precipitate into the conjugate region with additional follow-up atmospheric backscatter. Primary, degraded, and secondary electrons can be trapped back into the magnetosphere as they travel back and forth between the two magnetically conjugate ionospheres and continuously delivering their energy to the cold plasma sheet electrons and form the electron thermal fluxes that deposit this energy at the upper ionospheric altitudes. We consider the formation of these heat fluxes focusing on the magnetosphere-ionosphere energy interplay of the entire superthermal electron spectra from 1 eV up to 10 keV and discuss the efficiency of the different spectral energy intervals that contribute to the electron plasma heating at the magnetospheric altitudes. Our parametric studies at L = 6.8, with lower and upper band chorus whistler wave amplitudes of 10 pT and electron cyclotron harmonic wave amplitudes of 1 mVm<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicate the dominant role of the whistler mode in the formation of the electron heat flux coming from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.",

Spatially, the size of the RSL uncertainties varies across North America with the largest from Hudson Bay and near previous ice margins along the northern Atlantic and Pacific coasts, which suggests 3D viscosity structure in the lower mantle and laterally varying lithospheric thickness. Temporally, RSL uncertainties decrease from the Last Glacial Maximum to present except for west of Hudson Bay and the northeastern Pacific coast. The uncertainties of both these regions increase from 30 to 45 m between 15 and 11 ka BP, which may be due to the rapid decrease of surface loading at that time. Present-day U˙ and Ġ uncertainties are largest in southwestern Hudson Bay with magnitudes of 2.4 mm/year and 0.4 μGal/year, mainly due to the 3D viscosity structure in the lower mantle.",

  "abstract": "Energetic electron precipitation leads to increased nitric oxide (NO) production in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. NO distributions in the wintertime, high-latitude Southern Hemisphere atmosphere during geomagnetic storms are investigated. NO partial columns in the upper mesosphere at altitudes 70-90 km and in the lower thermosphere at 90-110 km have been derived from observations made by the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite. The SOFIE NO measurements during 17 geomagnetic storms in 2008-2014 have been binned into selected geomagnetic latitude and geographic latitude/longitude ranges. The regions above Antarctica showing the largest instantaneous NO increases coincide with high fluxes of 30-300 keV precipitating electrons from measurements by the second-generation Space Environment Monitor (SEM-2) Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) instrument on the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES). Significant NO increases over the Antarctic Peninsula are likely due to precipitation of &gt;30 keV electrons from the radiation belt slot region. NO transport is estimated using Horizontal Wind Model (HWM14) calculations. In the upper mesosphere strong eastward winds (daily mean zonal wind speed ~20-30 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 80 km) during winter transport NO-enriched air away from source regions 1-3 days following the storms. Mesospheric winds also introduce NO-poor air into the source regions, quenching initial NO increases.

  "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that global Pc5 pulsations observed by ground-based magnetometers may be accompanied by periodic oscillations in the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere measured by GPS receivers. These TEC observations may provide new insights into magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling mechanisms, especially when combined with other ground-based observational techniques. Presented in this paper is a large-scale morning sector Pc5 event which was observed simultaneously by ground-based magnetometers, two high-frequency Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars, and several Global Positioning System (GPS)/TEC receivers. The transient 2.6 mHz pulsations observed by the ground magnetometers and radars are accompanied by periodic fluctuations in the time rate-of-change of TEC (ROT) at the same frequency. To investigate possible mechanisms for the TEC modulation by ultralow frequency (ULF) waves, we determine the ratios between the spectral amplitudes of the magnetic, ionospheric Doppler velocity and ROT oscillations. The relationship between the simultaneous magnetic field and ionospheric Doppler velocity oscillations can be reasonably well interpreted using the theory of Alfven wave interaction with the thin ionospheric layer. Though the observed ratio between ROT and Doppler velocity amplitudes can be explained by the occurrence of local steep gradient of the topside ionosphere plasma at auroral latitudes, the responsible modulation mechanism cannot be considered as firmly established.",

  "abstract": "Due to differences in solar illumination, a geomagnetic field line may have one foot point in a dark ionosphere while the other ionosphere is in daylight. This may happen near the terminator under solstice conditions. In this situation, a resonant wave mode may appear, which has a node in the electric field in the sunlit (high conductance) ionosphere and an antinode in the dark (low conductance) ionosphere. Thus, the length of the field line is one quarter of the wavelength of the wave, in contrast with half-wave field line resonances in which both ionospheres are nodes in the electric field. These quarter waves have resonant frequencies that are roughly a factor of 2 lower than the half-wave frequency on the field line. We have simulated these resonances using a fully three-dimensional model of ULF waves in a dipolar magnetosphere. The ionospheric conductance is modeled as a function of the solar zenith angle, and so this model can describe the change in the wave resonance frequency as the ground magnetometer station varies in local time. The results show that the quarter-wave resonances can be excited by a shock-like impulse at the dayside magnetosphere and exhibit many of the properties of the observed waves. In particular, the simulations support the notion that a conductance ratio between day and night foot points of the field line must be greater than about 5 for the quarter waves to exist.",

  "abstract": "The open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere varies during substorms as a result of dayside and nightside reconnection. The open flux can be calculated from the area of the polar cap, delineated by the open-closed field line boundary (OCB). This study presents a superposed epoch analysis of the location of the OCB and the change in the magnetic flux content in individual nightside MLT sectors during substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases. Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the IMAGE satellite are used to derive a proxy of the OCB location. In the hour prior to substorm onset, the total nightside flux content increases by up to 0.12 GWb on average, resulting in an equatorward expansion of the OCB. Following substorm onset, the OCB contracts toward the pole as the open magnetic flux content decreases by up to 0.14 GWb on average, but the rate of decrease of the total nightside open flux content differs by 5-66% between the three IMAGE far ultraviolet instruments. The OCB does not contract poleward uniformly in all nightside magnetic local time (MLT) sectors after substorm onset. Close to the substorm onset MLT sector, the OCB contracts immediately following substorm onset; however, the OCB in more dawnward and duskward MLT sectors continues to expand equatorward for up to 120 minutes after substorm onset. Despite the continued increase in flux in these sectors after substorm onset, the total nightside flux content decreases immediately at substorm onset, indicating that the nightside reconnection rate exceeds the dayside rate following substorm onset.",

  "abstract": "The spatial structure of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves is calculated in the dayside magnetosphere. A balanced model is developed of a dipole magnetosphere with a plasma rotating in the azimuthal direction. The magnetopause is in the form of a smooth transition layer. It is shown that the largest-scale FMS eigen harmonics are either weakly unstable or neutrally stable. The calculations show that the eigen oscillation amplitudes increase greatly from the magnetopause into the magnetosphere. Presumably, the dayside magnetosphere plays the role of a sort of focusing lens for ULF FMS waves. Hence, one can expect a significant increase in the magnetosonic oscillation amplitudes in the inner part of the magnetosphere when the FMS oscillations (determining the magnetopause eigen oscillation amplitudes) are amplified in the magnetosheath.",

  "abstract": "Acquisition of relatively large data sets based on measurements in the interplanetary medium, throughout Earth's magnetosphere, and from ground-based platforms has been a hallmark of the heliophysics discipline for several decades. Early methods of time series analysis with such datasets revealed key causal physical relationships and led to successful forecast models of magnetospheric substorms and geomagnetic storms. Applying neural network methods and linear prediction filtering approaches provided tremendous insights into how solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling worked under various forcing conditions. Some applications of neural net and related methods were viewed askance in earlier times because it was not obvious how to extract or infer the underlying physics of input-output relationships. Today, there are powerful new methods being developed in the data sciences that harken back to earlier successful specification and forecasting methods. This paper reviews earlier work and looks at new prospects for heliophysics prediction methods.",

  "abstract": "Thunderstorm is a complex of electrical, optical, and acoustical phenomena that occurs in the troposphere layer and liberates a huge amount of energy, which diffuses the electric field, propagates atmospheric acoustic and gravity waves into the ionosphere, and changes the ionospheric parameters such as the electron density and ionospheric conductivity. In this paper, irregularities in the TEC, the activity of IGW and IAW, influenced by thunderstorm were investigated for July 2017. Our results show a direct relationship between increase in thunderstorm activities and the TEC irregularities. The average of irregularity amplitudes, under severe thunderstorm conditions was 1.3 times larger than calm conditions (non-lightning days). Further, ROTI average on high thunderstorm activity days was obtained 1.25 times larger in value, compared to calm conditions. Furthermore, the average of IGWs maximum amplitudes was 0.23 and 0.12 TECU for high and low thunderstorm activity days, respectively. Our statistical study showed clear effects of intense thunderstorms on the ionosphere, mostly with a roughly 1-2 h delay. It should be noted that solar activity and geomagnetic conditions were the same in all investigated days.",

  "abstract": "Models of magnetospheric ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves can be used to study wave phenomena and to calculate the effect of these waves on the energization and transport of radiation belt electrons. We present a decision tree ensemble (i.e., a random forest) model of ground-based ULF wave power spectral density driven by solar wind speed v<SUB>sw</SUB>, north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field Bz, and variance of proton number density var(Np). This model corresponds to four radial locations in the magnetosphere (roughly L ∼ 4.21 to 7.94) and spans 1-15 mHz, with hourly magnetic local time resolution. The decision tree ensembles are easier to use than the previous model generation; they have better coverage, perform better at predicting power, and have reduced error due to intelligently chosen bins in parameter space. We outline the difficulties in extracting physics from parameterized models and demonstrate a hypothesis testing framework to iteratively explore finer driving processes. We confirm a regime change for ULF driving about Bz = 0. We posit that ULF wave power directly driven by magnetopause perturbations corresponds to a latitude-dependent dawn-dusk asymmetry, which we see with increasing speed. Model uncertainty identifies where the underlying physics is not fully captured; we find that power due to substorms is less well characterized by Bz &gt; 0, with an effect that is seen globally and not just near midnight. The largest uncertainty is seen for the smallest amounts of solar wind driving, suggesting that internal magnetospheric properties may play a significant role in ULF wave occurrence.",

  "abstract": "Azimuthal structuring is usually observed within the brightening auroral substorm onset arc; such structure has been linked to the exponential growth of electromagnetic ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves. We present a case study investigating the timing and frequency dependence of such ULF waves on the ground and in the near-Earth magnetotail. In the magnetotail, we observe an increase in broadband wave power across the 10- to 100-s period range. On the ground, the arrival times spread from an epicenter. The onset of longer period waves occurs first and propagates fastest in latitude and longitude, while shorter periods appear to be more confined to the onset arc. The travel time from the spacecraft to the ground is inferred to be approximately 1-2 min for ULF wave periods between 15 and 60 s, with transit times of 60 s or less for longer period waves. This difference might be attributed to preferential damping of the shorter period waves, as their amplitude would take longer to rise above background levels. These results have important consequences for constraining the physics of substorm onset processes in the near-Earth magnetotail and their communication to the ground.",

Our investigations reveal the existence of significant correlations between the entropies of Dst, ap, and P<SUP>*</SUP>, and between such entropies and event strengths, as well as good correlations between peak levels of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling and ring current (Dst) and ap entropies, suggesting a potential predictability of significant Dst and ap events on the basis of appropriate functions of P<SUP>*</SUP>. Sensibly weaker correlations are found with AE entropy. We further show the presence of several significant entropy correlations between geomagnetic indices, solar wind-magnetosphere coupling, and trapped or precipitated energetic electron and ion fluxes measured by geostationary and low Earth orbit satellites in the outer radiation belt during the same periods. Entropy correlations between Dst and trapped or precipitated 30- to 80-keV ion fluxes at low L and between AE and trapped 40-keV electron fluxes at geostationary orbit correspond well with ring current properties and substorm-induced injections, respectively. Entropy correlations between ap and precipitation rates of energetic ion and electron fluxes demonstrate the sensibility of ap index entropy to both low-energy (5-30 keV) electron injections and ring current. The stronger entropy correlation between solar wind-magnetosphere coupling and ap than AE likely stems from the more stochastic behavior of electron injections and fast losses near geostationary orbit.",

We report a new phenomenon related to substorm onset: the development of a second pair of R2 field-aligned currents located equatorward of the preexisting R1/R2 currents, especially in the dusk sector. The appearance of such events favors the summer hemisphere, suggesting that ionospheric conductance modulates this phenomenon. During ongoing geomagnetic activity, the events have a quasiperiodicity of approximately 1 hr. We suggest that this phenomenon is related to subauroral polarization streams, which are strong westward flows in the dusk sector midlatitude ionosphere. This paper proposes a new mechanism that describes the formation of these current bifurcations: Consecutive particle injections into the inner magnetosphere during disturbed geomagnetic conditions cause separate partial ring currents to form, leading to the presence of distinct R2 current systems, all flowing into the R1 current.",

The OSSEs are performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results from the OSSEs demonstrate that the assimilation of ionosphere observations improves the short-term (1 hr) forecasts and analyses. The OSSEs show that the short-term forecasts and analyses are further improved when the ionosphere observations adjust the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature in addition to the ionosphere electron density. Based on an initialized forecast experiment, we find that adjusting the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature also leads to improved forecast skill in the ionosphere on longer time scales (i.e., beyond 1 hr). Additionally, it is shown that using a 1 hr data assimilation cycle, and removal of second-order divergence damping in WACCMX+DART significantly improves tidal amplitudes, which were previously found to be too small. These initial results represent the first whole atmosphere data assimilation system with capabilities to assimilate observations from the troposphere to the ionosphere-thermosphere.",

  "abstract": "Large initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis or force-model uncertainties, such as atmospheric density uncertainty are key drivers of the along-track uncertainty growth. Long propagation times may result in the need to use filtering algorithms for orbit determination that do not reside to the assumption of Gaussianity for state errors but estimate the entire probability density function. Adaptive Gaussian mixture based filters have shown promising results in the past. Previous research in the field of orbit determination using Gaussian mixture filters has restricted its attention to initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction. The present paper focuses on the consequences of including realistic, physics-based descriptions of atmospheric density uncertainty into the covariance propagation of the mixture kernels. <P />It is shown that the neglect of process noise, as has been customary for many years, can lead to undesired characteristics of the probability density function (pdf) estimates and that the inclusion of atmospheric density uncertainty process noise, even in cases where it is not the dominant driver of along-track uncertainty growth, is able to correct these deficiencies. For low orbiting satellites with increased ballistic coefficients or small initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction, density uncertainty is the dominant driver of the along-track uncertainty increase. Due to its growth that evolves at least cubic in time, situations may arise which require the usage of Gaussian mixtures also for the process noise when working in Cartesian coordinates. The theoretical foundation for this case is elaborated and an algorithm capable of dynamically switching between a single Gaussian and a Gaussian mixture for the density uncertainty process noise is presented.",

  "abstract": "To understand the inward propagation of the Pi2 waves generated by bursty bulk flows (BBFs) from the plasma sheet to the inner magnetosphere, we statistically investigate 137 midnight conjunction events with one satellite of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) in the plasma sheet and one satellite of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the inner magnetosphere. All events have Pi2 wave enhancements associated with BBFs at THEMIS. In response, larger Pi2 wave enhancements at GOES are correlated with larger dipolarization associated with each BBF at THEMIS but not with stronger waves and flows at THEMIS. The larger wave enhancements at GOES occur preferentially under stronger solar wind driving. We discuss an explanation considering that BBFs are an earthward moving plasma sheet bubble having relatively lower flux tube entropy compared to that of the background plasma and that Pi2 waves are generated by the slowing down of the bubble. The stronger dipolarization of BBFs suggests a bubble of smaller entropy, while the stronger solar wind driving leads to higher background entropy in the inner magnetosphere, both favorable for a bubble to penetrate deeper, and thus, Pi2 waves generated by the bubble are more likely to propagate to the GOES location with less damping to result in larger wave enhancements. In addition, our analyses using empirical density and magnetic field models suggest that the strong Pi2 wave enhancements at GOES are less likely to be a cavity resonance driven inside the plasmasphere.",

  "abstract": "We study the evolution of tropospheric ozone over the period 1979-2010 using a chemistry-climate model employing a stratosphere-troposphere chemistry scheme. By running with specified dynamics, the key feedback of composition on meteorology is suppressed, isolating the chemical response. By using historical forcings and emissions, interactions between processes are realistically represented. We use the model to assess how the ozone responds over time and to investigate model responses and trends. We find that the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-driven decrease in stratospheric ozone plays a significant role in the tropospheric ozone burden. Over the period 1979-1994, the decline in transport of ozone from the stratosphere, partially offsets an emissions-driven increase in tropospheric ozone production. From 1994-2010, despite a leveling off in emissions, increased stratosphere-to-troposphere transport of ozone drives a small increase in the tropospheric ozone burden. These results have implications for the impact of future stratospheric ozone recovery on air quality and radiative forcing.",

  "abstract": "Forecasting conditions in the thermosphere and ionosphere is a key outcome expected from space weather research. In this work, we perform numerical simulations using the first-principles models Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) and Thermosphere-Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) to address the reliability of thermospheric-ionospheric forecasts. When considering forecasts applicable to periods of geomagnetic activity, careful consideration is required of model inputs, which largely determine how the models will simulate disturbed conditions. We adopt an approach to drive the models with solar wind parameters and the 10.7 cm solar radio flux. This aligns our investigation with recent research and operational activities to forecast solar wind conditions on the Earth a few days in advance. In this work, we examine a weak geomagnetic storm, the June 2012 high-speed-stream event, for which we drive GITM and TIE-GCM with observed solar wind and F10.7 values. We find general agreement between the simulations and observation-based Global Ionospheric Maps of the total electron content (TEC) response. However, overestimated TEC response is found in the middle to low latitudinal region of the American sector and surrounding areas for both GITM and TIE-GCM during similar time periods. By conducting numerical modeling experiments and comparing the modeling results with observational data, we find that the overestimated TEC response can be almost equally attributed to the solar wind driving and F10.7 driving during the June 2012 event. We conclude that the accuracy of the high-latitude electric field and the solar irradiance is crucial to reproduce the TEC response in forecastable-mode modeling.",

Here a mission concept is described to solve the magnetic-connection problem. From an equatorial instrumented spacecraft, a powerful energetic-electron beam is fired into the atmospheric loss cone resulting in an optical beam spot in the upper atmosphere that can be optically imaged from the ground, putting the magnetic connection of the equatorial spacecraft's measurements into the context of the aurora. Multiple technical challenges that must be overcome for this mission concept are discussed: these include spacecraft charging, beam dynamics, beam stability, detection of the beam spot in the presence of aurora, and the safety of nearby spacecraft.",

Firstly, the error distribution of craters' localization is introduced, considering the characteristics of edge detection in crater images. Then, the error uncertainty of crater localization is described by the error ellipse and the influence of related factors on the crater localization error is analyzed. Further, in consideration of the characteristics that the localization errors are anisotropic, correlated and non-identically distributed, the weighted matrix of different craters is constructed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the error uncertainty matrix. Thereafter the weighted matrix is integrated into the attitude and position estimation algorithm. As a result, the weighted measurement uncertainty method for crater-based pose estimation is formed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by Monte Carlo simulation.",

The focus of our study is understanding how current modeling approaches may predict the global ionosphere for geomagnetic storms (as studied through 35 storms during 2000-2016). Prediction approach uses physics-based modeling without any manual model adjustment, quality control, or selection of the results. Our goal is to understand to what extent current physics-based modeling can be used in total electron content (TEC) prediction and explore uncertainties of these prediction efforts with multiday lead times. The ionosphere-thermosphere model runs are driven by actual interplanetary conditions, whether those data come from real-time measurements or predicted values themselves. These model runs were performed by the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)-produced global ionospheric maps (GIMs) were used to validate model TEC estimates. We utilize the True Skill Statistic (TSS) metric for the TEC prediction evaluation, noting that this is but one metric to assess predictive skill and that complete evaluations require combinations of such metrics. The meanings of contingency table elements for the prediction performance are analyzed in the context of ionosphere modeling. Prediction success is between about 0.2 and 0.5 for weak ionospheric disturbances and decreases for strong disturbances. We evaluate the prediction of TEC decreases and increases. Our results indicate that physics-based modeling during storms shows promise in TEC prediction with multiday lead time.",

  "abstract": "The terrestrial magnetosphere is perpetually exposed to and significantly deformed by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the solar wind. This deformation is typically detected at discrete locations by space- and ground-based observations. Earth's aurora, on the other hand, is a globally distributed phenomenon that may be used to elucidate magnetospheric deformations caused by IMF variations, as well as plasma supply from the deformed magnetotail to the high-latitude atmosphere. We report the utilization of an auroral form known as the transpolar arc (TPA) to diagnose the plasma dynamics of the globally deformed magnetosphere. Nine TPAs examined in this study have two types of a newly identified morphology, which are designated as \"J\"- and \"L\"-shaped TPAs from their shapes and are shown to have antisymmetric morphologies in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, depending on the IMF polarity. The TPA-associated ionospheric current profiles suggest that electric currents flowing along the magnetic field lines (field-aligned currents [FACs]), connecting the magnetotail and the ionosphere, may be related to the \"J\"- and \"L\"-shaped TPA formations. The FACs can be generated by velocity shear between fast plasma flows associated with nightside magnetic reconnection and slower background magnetotail plasma flows. Complex large-scale TPA FAC structures, previously unraveled by an magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation, cannot be elucidated by our observations. However, our interpretation of TPA features in a global context facilitates the usage of TPA as a diagnostic tool to effectively remote sense globally deformed terrestrial and planetary magnetospheric processes in response to the IMF and solar wind plasma conditions.",

  "abstract": "We present an analysis of planetary-scale oscillations during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events based on data obtained from a meteor radar located at Mohe (MH, 53.5°N, 122.3°E), the Aura satellite and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 data (MERRA2). The planetary-scale oscillations in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region during eight SSW events from 2012 to 2019 have been statistically investigated. Our analysis reveals that the enhancement or the generation of westward propagating quasi 16-day oscillation with wavenumber 1 (W1) is a common feature during SSWs over MH. A strong enhancement of the quasi 4-day oscillation during the 2018/2019 SSW is captured by both radar and satellite observations. The amplified quasi 4-day oscillation has a period of ~4.3 days in both meridional and zonal winds and with a wavenumber of W2 in the zonal component. Using the meteor radar and MERRA2 data, the vertical structure of the quasi 4-day oscillation from the stratosphere to the lower thermosphere is derived. The upward propagating feature of the quasi 4-day oscillation in the meridional component indicates that the oscillation is very likely generated in the lower mesosphere. The mesospheric zonal wind reversal after an elevated stratopause event is observed during the SSW, which results in a negative meridional gradient of the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity. Our results not only reveal that the amplified quasi 4-day oscillation in the MLT region is associated with the 2018/2019 SSW but also suggest that the amplification is originally generated around 60 km due to barotropic/baroclinic instability and propagates upward to MLT region.",

  "abstract": "Electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves play an important role in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. They are usually considered to be generated by the Bernstein-mode instability with electron loss cone distributions. By analyzing the Van Allen Probes wave data, we present the direct evidence of the nonlinear interactions between ECH waves in the magnetosphere. Substorm-injected electrons excite primary ECH waves in a series of structureless bands between multiples of the electron gyrofrequency. Nonlinear interactions between the primary ECH waves produce secondary waves at sum- and difference-frequencies of the primary waves. Our results suggest that the nonlinear wave-wave interactions can redistribute the primary ECH wave energy over a broader frequency range and hence potentially affect the magnetospheric electrons over a broader range of pitch angles and energies.",

The SABER data are being used to examine long-term changes and trends in temperature, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. A tacit, central assumption of these analyses is that the SABER instrument radiometric calibration is not changing with time; that is, the instrument is stable. SABER stratospheric temperatures and those derived from Global Positioning System Radio Occultation measurements are compared to examine SABER's stability. Global Positioning System Radio Occultation measurements are inherently stable due to the accuracy and traceability of the measured phase delay rate to the Système Internationale definition of the second. Differences in global annual mean SABER and COSMIC lower stratospheric temperatures show little significant change with time in the 11 years spanning 2007-2017. From this analysis we infer that SABER temperatures are stable to better than 0.1 to 0.2 K per decade.",

The wedge wave equation is used to compute rough expressions for dispersion relations and local growth rates in the midnight region of the nightside magnetotail where the instability develops, forming the auroral beads characteristic of geomagnetic substorm onset. Stability analysis for the shear flow-interchange modes demonstrates that nonlinear analysis is necessary for quantitatively accurate results and determines the spatial scale on which the instability varies.",

Of these, 91 were accompanied by auroral hiss during the substorm growth phase. No auroral hiss was recorded during the expansion and recovery phases. We found that auroral hiss was observed under rising polar cap (PC) index, showing an increased solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere during the substorm growth phase. We also found that in 58 of the 65 events studied, KAN was located in the vicinity of enhanced field-aligned currents (FACs) during auroral hiss occurrence. For the first time, it was established that auroral VLF hiss generation in the equatorial part of the auroral oval is a typical signature of a substorm growth phase.",

  "abstract": "Over the past two decades mounting evidence demonstrated that terrestrial weather significantly influences the dynamics and mean state of the thermosphere. While important progress has been made in understanding how this coupling occurs on hourly to daily time scales, large uncertainty still exists on this effect around intraseasonal (∼30-90 days) time scales. In this work, analyses of Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics-Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry temperatures near 110 km and Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer cross-track winds near 260 km reveal prominent intraseasonal oscillations in the equatorial (±15°) zonal mean lower and middle thermosphere. Similar intraseasonal oscillations are found in the amplitudes of the diurnal eastward propagating tide with Zonal Wavenumber 3 (DE3) and the quasi-3-day ultrafast Kelvin wave, two prominent ultrafast tropical waves (UFTWs) excited by deep tropical tropospheric convection. Numerical simulations from the Specified-Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended demonstrate a significant connection between these UFTW and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Compared to the boreal winter mean state, thermospheric UFTW amplitudes are larger (+5 to +12%) during MJO Phases 2-3 and smaller (-3% to -12%) during MJO Phases 6-8. Significant variations are also found with respect to the phase of the mesospheric semiannual oscillation (MSAO) and stratospheric quasi-biannual oscillation (SQBO), with larger (±12-16%) thermospheric amplitudes during westward MSAO/SQBO phase and smaller (±3-6%) amplitudes during eastward MSAO/SQBO phase, in accordance with theoretical interpretations. This study suggests that UFTW may play a large role in coupling tropospheric intraseasonal variability to the thermosphere, raising important questions including implications for the whole atmosphere system.",

  "abstract": "The formation of polar cap density enhancements, such as tongues-of-ionization (TOIs), are often attributed to enhanced dayside reconnection and convection due to solar wind changes. However, ionospheric poleward moving density enhancements can also form in the absence of changes in the solar wind. This study examines how TOI and patch events that are not triggered by solar wind changes relate to magnetospheric processes, specifically substorms. Based on total electron content and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) observations, we find substorms that occur at the same time as TOIs are associated with sudden enhancements in dayside poleward flows during the substorm expansion phase. Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) observations also show enhanced field-aligned currents (FACs) that extend into the dayside ionosphere during this period. We suggest that the global enhancement of FACs and convection during these substorms are the drivers of these TOIs by enhancing dayside convection and transporting high-density lower-latitude plasma into the polar cap. However, we also find that not all substorms are coincident with polar cap density enhancements. A superposed epoch study showed that the AL index for TOIs during substorms is not particularly stronger than substorms without TOIs, but epoch studies of AMPERE observations do show events with TOIs to have a higher total FAC on both the dayside and nightside. Our results show the importance of TOI formation during substorms when solar wind drivers are absent, and the importance of considering substorms in the global current system. This work also shows the need to incorporate substorms into models of high-latitude global convection and currents.",

  "abstract": "When the ionosphere is strongly disturbed, the performances of satellite navigation and positioning systems as well as various radio communication systems are reduced due to the electronic density gradient and ionospheric irregularities. However, the characteristics and coupling mechanism of ionospheric disturbances caused by meteorological activities in the lower atmosphere are still unclear. Therefore, as one of the most severe surface weather changes, it is of great practical significance to study the influence of typhoons on the ionosphere. In this paper, the ionospheric irregularities during 20 typhoons landing in Taiwan, Guangdong Province and the Philippines during the quiet solar and geomagnetic activities from 2006 to 2018 were analyzed by using the rate of change in the total electron content (ROTI). Through a statistical analysis of 20 typhoons, it was found that there are ionospheric irregularities during 15 typhoons. There was a certain correlation between ionospheric disturbances and the typhoons. Both typhoons MANGKHUT and HAIMA landed in Guangdong Province, but ROTI &gt; 0.5 TEC ·min<SUP>-1</SUP> was detected only when typhoon HAIMA made landfall in Guangdong. This phenomenon can be explained by the influence of terrain on the acoustic gravity waves. The HAIMA typhoon passed through Lianhua Mountain (altitude: 1336 m). When the typhoon landed in higher terrain, due to the resistance effect of the high terrain, the high rate of decline in the air creates an ideal condition for the development of the acoustic gravity waves. During the impact of the typhoon, the acoustic gravity waves can spread to the ionosphere height and have an impact on the ionosphere.",

  "abstract": "A framework is developed to model photoionization of metals deposited in the lower ionosphere as a result of meteoric ablation and photodetachment of electrons from negative ions of the Earth's ionosphere due to sources of emission other than solar radiation. A wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum including cases of negligible, moderate, and significant absorption of radiation is considered. We limit our scope to the radiation transport through lower ionospheric regions, in case when molecular oxygen, O<SUB>2</SUB>, is considered as the main absorber of radiation as photoabsorption due to ozone is only effective at stratospheric altitudes and molecular nitrogen, N<SUB>2</SUB>, is transparent to radiation with wavelengths longer than ∼100 nm. We model photon transport in an exponential atmosphere and derive efficient differential representations of the problem in case of negligible photoabsorption and constant pressure approximations. Photoabsorption asymmetry in the atmosphere is demonstrated in case of photons with absorption scales comparable to the scale height of the atmosphere. The application of the model to photoionization in the lower ionosphere is demonstrated by considering photoionization of meteoric species due to photons of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band system of N<SUB>2</SUB> observed in the aurora and in the lightning-induced transient luminous events.

  "abstract": "The tropical cyclone (TC)-induced concentric gravity waves (CGWs) are capable of propagating upward from convective sources in the troposphere to the upper atmosphere and creating concentric traveling ionospheric disturbances (CTIDs). To examine the CGWs propagation, we implement tropical cyclone-induced CGWs into the lower boundary of global ionosphere-thermosphere model with local-grid refinement (GITM-R) and simulate the influence of CGWs on the ionosphere and thermosphere. GITM-R is a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic general circulation model for the upper atmosphere with the local-grid refinement module to enhance the resolution at the location of interest. In this study, CGWs induced by the typhoon Meranti in 2016 have been simulated. Information of the TC shape and moving trails is obtained from the TC best-track dataset, and the gravity wave patterns are specified at the lower boundary of GITM-R (100 km altitude). The horizontal wavelength and phase velocity of wave perturbation at the lower boundary are specified to be consistent with the TEC observations. The simulation reveals a clear evolution of CTIDs, which shows reasonable agreement with the GPS-TEC observations. This is the first time the typhoon-driven TEC perturbation has been simulated in a general circulation model. To further examine the dependence of the CTIDs on the wavelength and frequency of the gravity wave perturbation at the lower boundary, different waveforms have been tested as well. The magnitude of CTIDs has a negative correlation with the period but a positive correlation with the wavelength when the horizontal phase velocities are sufficiently fast against the critical-level absorption.",

  "abstract": "Accurate forecast of the thermospheric density is critical to the space community. The data assimilation approach that is based on the self-consistent upper-atmosphere model may provide better predictive capability of the coupled thermosphere system. In this study, a physics-based assimilation system (hereafter referred to as PIDA) that is based on the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model was used to validate the capability of reproducing the evolution of the global thermosphere state. The effective solar and geophysical drivers were estimated by ingesting neutral density from a single satellite into the PIDA. It was found that the PIDA can reproduce the temporal variation of the global thermospheric density at around the altitude where the orbit density was ingested. Furthermore, the PIDA is also capable of capturing the temporal evolution of the thermospheric density at various altitudes. However, a systematic bias, depending on altitude, is seen in the modeled neutral density of the PIDA. Moreover, this systematic bias in the thermospheric density is likely ascribed to the overestimation of the density in the lower thermosphere. Consequently, the spatial and temporal evolutions of the lower thermosphere under various conditions should be considered carefully in the physics-based data assimilation system. Additionally, the assessments of the obtained results suggested that the observations of multiple parameters at different altitudes are required to be assimilated into the thermospheric model.",

On 16-17 September 2015, MSTIDs with very fast horizontal phase speeds, propagating toward northeast (NE), were observed over the latitude region of 0-30°S in the afternoon to evening time zone. It was geomagnetically quiet time (Kp: 2-3). An EPB development was observed after one of the MSTIDs crossed the solar terminator at 22:00 UT. Large-scale MLT-GWs with slower phase speeds were also observed both at São João do Cariri (7.5°S, 35.0°W) propagating from southwest (SW) to NE and Cachoeira Paulista (22.7°S, 45.0°W) propagating northward. This is to report on what we consider as a signature of direct seeding of EPBs by an MSTID that was likely induced by a secondary GW from tropospheric deep cloud convections to the south.

  "abstract": "Routine monitoring and forecasting of the ionosphere is becoming imperative for our society due to the rapid increase of our reliance on space-based technologies. In the last two decades, satellite remote sensing of the OI 135.6-nm airglow emission has been used as a primary means for inferring the nighttime ionosphere on a global scale. By contrast, the OI 130.4-nm emission, another prominent airglow feature, has long been suggested to be possibly useful for ionospheric remote sensing but has rarely been studied in the literature, partially due to the complexity of the radiative transfer effects involved in the interpretation of this emission. In this study, we explore the use of OI 130.4-nm emission for nighttime ionospheric remote sensing by analyzing the data observed by the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) aboard NASA's Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) mission using a newly developed radiative transfer model. We demonstrate through data analysis and theoretical investigations that limb observations of the OI 130.4-nm emission can be used to complement the OI 135.6-nm emission for a better characterization of the spatial variation of nighttime ionosphere and that nadir observations of the OI 130.4-nm emission can be used to estimate the total electron content (TEC) and the peak density (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) in smoothly varying ionospheric regions more accurately than the OI 135.6-nm emission. We further propose techniques for estimating the ionospheric peak height (h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) using nadir observations of the two emissions. Our results can provide useful information for future ionospheric remote sensing missions.",

  "abstract": "This study analyzes the characteristics of non-substorm Pi2 (impulsive pulsations [3-25 mHz]) from low and middle latitudes and investigates the trends of these oscillations. Pi2 events are identified from geomagnetic H-component data from low and middle latitude observatories Hyderabad (HYB, L = 1.03) and Paratunka (PET, L = 2.1) respectively, during solar maximum period (2015-2016) for quietest geomagnetic conditions, with stringent criteria of interplanetary parameters and activity indices. Data from five high-latitude stations from THEMIS ground magnetometer chain, covering all local time sectors are additionally analyzed to verify the absence of substorms, pseudo substorms, etc. which may also generate Pi2 signatures. Variation of non-substorm Pi2 periods with geomagnetic activity index Kp and solar wind speed (Vsw) show inverse relations with Pi2 period at HYB. In addition, non-substorm Pi2s are distributed equally in all local time sectors with ratio of second harmonic to fundamental Pi2 ranging within 1.3-2.2. These trends of non-substorm Pi2s indicate plasmaspheric cavity resonance (PCR) as the dominant source at low latitude, confirmed using a theoretical model. In contrast, non-substorm Pi2 periods do not show a steady trend with Kp and Vsw at midlatitude station PET. Local time variations show an increased period in the premidnight sector at PET. A close agreement between theoretical estimates and observed periods of non-substorm Pi2-s at PET, leads to the inference of Alfvenic nature of these modes, attributable to a resonant oscillation.",

  "abstract": "We show the regions where nonlinear growth of whistler-mode chorus waves is preferred to occur in the inner magnetosphere. A global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation was used to obtain large-scale electric and magnetic fields under the southward interplanetary magnetic field condition. With the electric and magnetic fields obtained by the MHD simulation, we ran a comprehensive inner magnetosphere-ionosphere model to solve the evolution of phase space density of electrons. Hot electrons originating from the tail region drift sunward and penetrate deep into the inner region due to a combination of convection and substorm-associated electric fields. Cold electrons also drift sunward, resulting in a contraction of the plasmasphere. We obtained the following results. (1) The whistler waves can first grow due to the linear mechanism (pitch angle anisotropy) in the premidnight-prenoon region outside the plasmapause, followed by rapid, nonlinear mechanism accompanied with rising-tone chorus elements. (2) When the solar wind speed is high, the whistler waves grow more efficiently due to linear and nonlinear mechanisms over a wider area because of deep penetration of hot electrons and the large contraction of the plasmasphere. This is consistent with the observation that the outer belt electrons increase for the fast solar wind. (3) For slow solar wind, the linear growth is mostly suppressed, but the nonlinear growth can still take place when external seed waves are present. This may explain the persistence of dawn chorus and large-amplitude chorus waves that are often observed in the premidnight-postdawn region in relatively weak geomagnetic activities.",

  "abstract": "The electron precipitation in the region of the diffuse aurora should be considered as a two-step process (Khazanov et al., 2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL072063\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL072063</A>). The first one is the interaction of plasma sheet electrons with electrostatic electron cyclotron and/or whistler waves, moving those electrons into the loss cone to precipitate in both magnetically conjugate atmospheres. The second step is the interaction of these electrons with the ionosphere and atmosphere via their elastic and nonelastic collisions and reflection (backscatter) of degraded electrons back to magnetosphere and conjugate ionospheres. This paper presents the results of a newly developed scenario of nonsteady-state electron precipitation dynamics that accounts for magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere energy interplay over the entire energy range of the plasma sheet electron population and their affiliated secondary electrons. It also studies how both magnetically conjugate auroral regions work together with the magnetosphere in the formation of electron precipitation in the region of the diffuse aurora with the energy range coverage from 1 eV up to 10 keV.",

  "abstract": "We propose a possible classification of the responses of the magnetosphere to the interaction with diamagnetic structures (DS), which form the basis of the slow solar wind. The main determinants of the classification are the value and orientation of the vertical component Bz of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the solar wind density N. We have identified three types of magnetospheric responses. Type 1 has two subtypes whose main difference is the presence or absence of auroras on the day side of the magnetosphere. Within an hour before DS arrival, Bz has a positive value (up to 12 nT) or fluctuates about 0 in the range from -1 to +1 nT. For both subtypes, the duration of substorm disturbances approximately coincides with the duration of DS, and their intensity does not exceed AE~500 nT. Type 2 is characterized by the fact that before the contact with DS positive IMF Bz (0-10 nT) is recorded for an hour, and at the interface of DS a rapid (≤2 min) change in the orientation of the IMF vertical component from north to south occurs. For type 3, Bz within an hour before the contact with DS is negative (from -10 to 0 nT). We address the problem of DS energy transfer to the magnetosphere.",

  "abstract": "Throat auroras frequently observed near local noon have been confirmed to correspond to magnetopause indentations, but the generation mechanisms for these indentations and the detailed properties of throat aurora are both not fully understood. Using all-sky camera and magnetometer observations, we reported some new observational features of throat aurora as follows. (1) Throat auroras can occur under stable solar wind conditions and cause clear geomagnetic responses. (2) These geomagnetic responses can be simultaneously observed at conjugate geomagnetic meridian chains in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. (3) The initial geomagnetic responses of throat aurora show concurrent onsets that were observed at all stations along the meridians. (4) Immediately after the concurrent onsets, poleward moving signatures and micropositive bays were observed in the X components at higher- and lower-latitude stations, respectively. We argue that these observations provide evidence for throat aurora being generated by low-latitude magnetopause reconnection. We suggest that the concurrent onsets reflect the instantaneous responses of the reconnection signal arriving at the ionosphere, the followed poleward moving signatures reflect the antisunward dragging of the footprint of newly opened field lines, and the micropositive bays may result from a pair of field-aligned currents generated during the reconnection. This study may shed new light on the geomagnetic transients observed at cusp latitude near magnetic local noon.",

  "abstract": "Ultralow frequency (ULF) electromagnetic waves are regularly detected by satellites near the plasmapause during substorms. Usually, the small-scale waves are observed embedded in the large-scale, quasi-stationary electric field. We suggest that the small-scale waves are generated in the ionosphere by the interactions between the large-scale field and irregularities in the ionospheric density/conductivity. Under certain conditions, these waves can be trapped in the global magnetospheric resonator and amplified by the positive feedback interactions with the ionosphere. To verify this hypothesis, we model with a two-fluid magnetohydrodynamics code structure and amplitude of the ULF waves simultaneously observed near the plasmapause by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite at low altitudes and the Combined Release and Radiation Effects satellite at high altitudes. Simulations reproduce in good, quantitative detail the structure and amplitude of the observed waves. In particular, simulations reproduce a \"spiky\" character of the electric field observed by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite at low altitude, which is a characteristic feature of ULF waves produced by the ionospheric feedback instability.",

  "abstract": "Due to the limited number and uneven distribution globally of Beidou Satellite System (BDS) stations, the contributions of BDS to global ionosphere modeling is still not significant. In order to give a more realistic evaluation of the ability for BDS in ionosphere monitoring and multi-GNSS contributions to the performance of Differential Code Biases (DCBs) determination and ionosphere modeling, we select 22 stations from Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) to assess the result of regional ionospheric model and DCBs estimates over China where the visible satellites and monitoring stations for BDS are comparable to those of GPS/GLONASS. Note that all the 22 stations can track the dual- and triple-frequency GPS, GLONASS, and BDS observations. In this study, seven solutions, i.e., GPS-only (G), GLONASS-only (R), BDS-only (C), GPS + BDS (GC), GPS + GLONASS (GR), GLONASS + BDS (RC), GPS + GLONASS + BDS (GRC), are used to test the regional ionosphere modeling over the experimental area. Moreover, the performances of them using single-frequency precise point positioning (SF-PPP) method are presented. The experimental results indicate that BDS has the same ionospheric monitoring capability as GPS and GLONASS. Meanwhile, multi-GNSS observations can significantly improve the accuracy of the regional ionospheric models compared with that of GPS-only or GLONASS-only or BDS-only, especially over the edge of the tested region which the accuracy of the model is improved by reducing the RMS of the maximum differences from 5-15 to 2-3 TECu. For satellite DCBs estimates of different systems, the accuracy of them can be improved significantly after combining different system observations, which is improved by reducing the STD of GPS satellite DCB from 0.243 to 0.213, 0.172, and 0.165 ns after adding R, C, and RC observations respectively, with an increment of about 12.3%, 29.4%, and 32.2%. The STD of GLONASS satellite DCB improved from 0.353 to 0.304, 0.271, and 0.243 ns after adding G, C, and GC observations, respectively. The STD of BDS satellite DCB reduced from 0.265 to 0.237, 0.237 and 0.229 ns with the addition of G, R and GR systems respectively, and increased by 10.6%, 10.4%, and 13.6%. From the experimental positioning result, it can be seen that the regional ionospheric models with multi-GNSS observations are better than that with a single satellite system model.",

First, analytic equations are derived to estimate the relative density error due to an input parameter uncertainty in any of the environmental parameters supplied to the model.

  "abstract": "As an important dynamic process in the plasma sheet, ballooning instability was suggested to be responsible for unstable plasma involving azimuthal wave structures. The upward and downward alternately flowing field-aligned currents developed in association with unstable waves may cause the finger/beading-like auroral wave structures along the longitudinal direction, which is a common auroral feature preceding the auroral substorm poleward expansions. In our previous study, we directly evaluated the ballooning instability criterion using in situ observations in conjunction with auroral images and found that the ballooning unstable condition is satisfied in the near-Earth plasma sheet prior to the auroral wave structures preceding substorm onset. In this study, we adopted the same method and examine the plasma sheet conditions within the regions in conjunction with weak transient auroral wave structures that fade out without further intensification and poleward expansion. The results from analyzing eight events show that no abrupt changes were found in plasma moments and field data. However, the magnetohydrodynamic ballooning instability criterion estimated from observations was satisfied shortly before the initiation of the auroral wave structures due to the changes in plasma spatial profiles. Instability develops against waves with shorter wavelength than those in ambient plasma. Weak magnetic oscillations within the Pi2 band were associated with the instability. These results suggest that the ballooning instability in the plasma sheet transition region is a plausible candidate for causing auroral wave structures during non-substorm time. The unstable state of the plasma may not necessarily lead to favorable conditions for the substorm onset to occur.",

  "abstract": "This study investigated the regime-dependent predictability using convective-scale ensemble forecasts initialized with different initial condition perturbations in the Yangtze and Huai River basin (YHRB) of East China. The scale-dependent error growth (ensemble variability) and associated impact on precipitation forecasts (precipitation uncertainties) were quantitatively explored for 13 warm-season convective events that were categorized in terms of strong forcing and weak forcing. The forecast error growth in the strong-forcing regime shows a stepwise increase with increasing spatial scale, while the error growth shows a larger temporal variability with an afternoon peak appearing at smaller scales under weak forcing. This leads to the dissimilarity of precipitation uncertainty and shows a strong correlation between error growth and precipitation across spatial scales. The lateral boundary condition errors exert a quasi-linear increase on error growth with time at the larger scale, suggesting that the large-scale flow could govern the magnitude of error growth and associated precipitation uncertainties, especially for the strong-forcing regime. Further comparisons between scale-based initial error sensitivity experiments show evident scale interaction including upscale transfer of small-scale errors and downscale cascade of larger-scale errors. Specifically, small-scale errors are found to be more sensitive in the weak-forcing regime than those under strong forcing. Meanwhile, larger-scale initial errors are responsible for the error growth after 4 h and produce the precipitation uncertainties at the meso-β-scale. Consequently, these results can be used to explain under-dispersion issues in convective-scale ensemble forecasts and provide feedback for ensemble design over the YHRB.",

Some observational properties of throat aurora have been established, but the geomagnetic response is not yet explored. Using geomagnetic observations from a chain of stations in the Norwegian sector and auroral observations from an all-sky imager and the DMSP satellites, for the first time, we identify geomagnetic responses associated with the occurrence of throat aurora. These variations are well explained by combining the models of flux transfer events and throat aurora. The estimated increase in ionospheric equivalent current confirms the association of throat aurora with ground observations. The results provide further evidence for throat aurora being associated with magnetopause reconnection. Based on the observational features, a new association of geomagnetic variations with throat aurora may be defined to reflect their occurrence at high latitudes near local noon.",

Due to these interdependences and the associated observational challenges, energetic ion outflows remain a poorly understood facet of atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling. Here we demonstrate the relationship between east-west magnetic field fluctuations (ΔBEW) and energetic outflows in the magnetosphere-ionosphere transition region. We use dayside cusp region FAST satellite observations made near apogee (∼4,180-km altitude) near fall equinox and solstices in both hemispheres to derive statistical relationships between ion upflow and ΔBEW spectral power as a function of spacecraft frame frequency bands between 0 and 4 Hz. Identification of ionospheric-origin energetic ion upflows is automated, and the spectral power PEWin each frequency band is obtained via integration of ΔBEW power spectral density. Derived relationships are of the form J&gt;‖,i=J0,iPEWγ for upward ion flux J&gt;‖,i at 130-km altitude, with J0,i the mapped upward ion flux for a nominal spectral power PEW=1 nT<SUP>2</SUP>. The highest correlation coefficients are obtained for spacecraft frame frequencies ∼0.1-0.5 Hz. Summer solstice and fall equinox observations yield power law indices γ≃ 0.9-1.3 and correlation coefficients r≥0.92, while winter solstice observations yield γ≃ 0.4-0.8 with r≳0.8. Mass spectrometer observations reveal that the oxygen/hydrogen ion composition ratio near summer solstice is much greater than the corresponding ratio near winter. These results reinforce the importance of ion composition in outflow models. If observed ΔBEW perturbations result from Doppler-shifted wave structures with near-zero frequencies, we show that spacecraft frame frequencies ∼0.1-0.5 Hz correspond to perpendicular spatial scales of several to tens of kilometers.",

  "abstract": "A Japanese garden is a poetic expression of the universe, containing everything embracing the environment and all life forms that are ever-changing. It subtly reflects the microcosm and macrocosm that are inside and outside of humans, and their inter-relationship. Indeed, the relationships between the universe and humans are poetically deepened in Japanese gardens. Humans have explored the universe in various ways. Particle physics, for instance, has allowed humans to unveil the universe through fundamental theories and experiments. Yet, what humans have discovered is but a small fragment of the whole structure of the universe. In quantum mechanics, the theory forming the basis of particle physics, nothing is certain within this universe. In other words, everything is uncertain. Believing that this uncertainty would bring freedom of thoughts, fertilizing the creativity of humans, the authors would like to challenge this question: how can we approach the essence of the universe through the idea of 'uncertainty' together with the art of creating a Japanese garden? This is addressed through the design of the Uncertain Garden at IdeaSquare, the R&amp;D innovation platform at CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire), and Zojo-ji, a temple in Tokyo. The basic characteristics of IdeaSquare can be found in its concept of openness - an acceptance of others having different values in an international, interdisciplinary environment. This project creates a space where visitors and collaborators at CERN can think about and realize the richness of uncertainty, leading to positive effects in their works and lives. Furthermore, this garden is expected to open up a new way of innovation at the fundamental level, finding subtle beauty in uncertainty. For instance, its design will be influenced by the uncertain aspects of nature, such as the shapes of water waves and effects of lighting. This paper describes the creative process and realization of the Uncertain Garden.",

  "abstract": "Total electron count (TEC) enhancements due to space weather are a threat to communications and global positioning systems. It is known that TEC enhancements occur during magnetic storms and can cover large areas for many hours, but it is also not uncommon for TEC enhancements on the order of a few TEC units to occur during substorms. Although much is known about storm-associated TECs, the temporal and spatial characteristics of substorm-associated TECs are not well established. By combining two-dimensional maps of TECs over North America and Greenland and with maps of ionospheric currents derived with the spherical elementary current method [Weygand et al., 2011], we investigate the temporal and spatial changes of TEC enhancement events for both a single substorm and for multiple substorms combined using a two-dimensional superposed-epoch analysis. Both the single event analysis and the statistical analysis show an increase of TECs during the expansion phase. Substorm values of the TEC enhancements peak within 10 min after auroral onset and recover to nominal levels after about 40 min. TEC enhancements occur mainly within the nightside region 1 current system and cover millions of square kilometers. Furthermore, these enhancements appear to be associated with enhanced precipitating electron fluxes. These results address one of goals of the Space Weather Action Plan, which are to establish benchmarks for space weather events and improve modeling and prediction of their impacts on infrastructure.",

  "abstract": "The exchange of energy between the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere thermosphere system is not well understood. One of the parameters that is important in the lower thermosphere is atomic oxygen. It has recently been observed that atomic oxygen is higher in summer at ∼95 km. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of the upper thermosphere to lower thermospheric atomic oxygen using the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM). We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) to drive the lower atmospheric boundary of atomic oxygen in GITM between ∼95 and 100 km and compare the results with the current mass spectrometer incoherent scatter (MSIS) driven GITM. MSIS has higher atomic oxygen in the winter hemisphere while WACCM-X has higher atomic oxygen in the summer hemisphere. The reversal of atomic oxygen distribution affects the pressure distribution between 100 and 120 km, such that the hemisphere with larger O number density has stronger equatorward winds, and lower temperature mainly due to adiabatic and radiative cooling. This affects thermospheric scale heights such that the hemisphere with more O has lower N<SUB>2</SUB> and thus enhanced O/N<SUB>2</SUB>. This behavior is observed in the opposite hemisphere when MSIS is used as the lower boundary for GITM. Overall, O/N<SUB>2</SUB> for WACCM-X driven GITM matches better with the global ultraviolet imager (GUVI) data. We find that the impact of lower thermospheric atomic oxygen on upper thermosphere is not just through diffusive equilibrium but also through secondary effects on winds and temperature.",

  "abstract": "An accurate description of the topside ionosphere is of great importance for space weather applications. Currently, there are two commonly used empirical ionosphere models, that is, NeQuick2 and IRI-2016, that can be used to describe the topside ionosphere. In this study, topside total electron content (TEC) values derived from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are selected to validate the topside ionosphere predictions of the NeQuick2 and IRI-2016 models from 2008 to 2018. The results show that these two models both underestimate the topside ionosphere. Compared with the global topside ionosphere model estimated by LEO-based global positioning system (GPS) observations with orbital altitudes of 500 and 800 km, NeQuick2 and IRI-2016 have similar performances over different latitudes and longitudes. The daily mean root mean square (RMS) values are approximately 4.10 and 2.10 TEC units (TECU) for the region above 500 and 800 km, respectively. The results assessed by the GPS-TEC technique indicate that the performance of the NeQuick2 model is slightly better than that of the IRI-2016 model. The daily mean bias mainly ranges from -1.5 to 1.5 and -3.0 to -1.0 TECU for the regions above 500 and 800 km, respectively. The RMS values for the corresponding parts are 3.50 and 2.74 TECU. Finally, the validation results of the dSTEC method show that the mean bias is -0.43 and -0.20 TECU above 500 and 800 km, respectively. The mean RMS values are 2.04 and 0.72 TECU for the corresponding regions.",

  "abstract": "The present work displays the observations of an afternoon detached aurora along with ionospheric high-latitude trough. The event was observed by DMSP F17 on 19 September 2014. The afternoon detached aurora was isolated from the auroral oval and was located between 12:00-18:00 magnetic local time (MLT) and 65-70° geomagnetic latitude (MLAT). Particle observations indicate that the afternoon detached aurora was produced by energetic ring current ions with energies above 10 keV where the main ion energy was likely to be above the upper limit of DMSP measurement ( 30 keV). Magnetometer observation from the ground implies that the energetic ions were likely scattered by EMIC waves. Both the detached aurora and the auroral oval are found to be well inside the high-latitude trough with MLAT between 64° and 76° (68-80° GLAT). The auroral oval corresponds to a westward (sunward) plasma drift. It is expected that the westward drift transports the low-density plasma in the nightside toward the dayside, leading to the high-latitude trough formation. The afternoon detached aurora was well equatorward of the high-latitude trough, and the corresponding plasma drift was nearly zero. The plasma associated with the detached aurora is expected to be stagnant, and broaden the high-latitude trough equatorward.",

  "abstract": "One of the most successful instruments used to investigate the Earth's ionosphere is coherent scatter radars such as the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). Their method of mapping plasma convection at high latitudes is contingent on irregularities that momentarily exist in the ionosphere and are elongated along the direction of the geomagnetic field. Under these conditions, SuperDARN transmits high-frequency (HF) waves that are then backscattered from these plasma irregularities. In order for maximum backscatter to occur, the wave vector of the incident wave must be orthogonal to the magnetic field lines. This is called the \"orthogonality condition.\" Over the years, ray tracing results have generated many assumptions, where and how orthogonality occurs. However, since ray tracing only tracks the primary direction of energy flow and typically does not account for diffraction, it provides an incomplete understanding of the interaction of HF waves with small ionospheric irregularities. This work investigates the orthogonality assumptions by modeling at high-resolution HF electromagnetic wave interactions with small-scale irregularities in the ionosphere. Specifically, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is employed to determine where orthogonality occurs in the ionosphere and the number of times the condition is satisfied during the simulation. The results provide insights into the orthogonality condition as a function of source frequency and elevation angle for both unperturbed and perturbed ionospheres. From these results, small-scale irregularities are observed to sometimes contribute significantly to the production of backscatter. A discussion is provided to highlight where three existing orthogonality condition assumptions are incorrect or misleading.",

  "abstract": "To represent model uncertainties more comprehensively, a stochastically perturbed parameterization (SPP) scheme consisting of temporally and spatially varying perturbations of 18 parameters in the microphysics, convection, boundary layer, and surface layer parameterization schemes, as well as the stochastically perturbed parameterization tendencies (SPPT) scheme, and the stochastic kinetic energy backscatter (SKEB) scheme, is applied in the Global and Regional Assimilation and Prediction Enhanced System—Regional Ensemble Prediction System (GRAPES-REPS) to evaluate and compare the general performance of various combinations of multiple stochastic physics schemes. Six experiments are performed for a summer month (1-30 June 2015) over China and multiple verification metrics are used. The results show that: (1) All stochastic experiments outperform the control (CTL) experiment, and all combinations of stochastic parameterization schemes perform better than the single SPP scheme, indicating that stochastic methods can effectively improve the forecast skill, and combinations of multiple stochastic parameterization schemes can better represent model uncertainties; (2) The combination of all three stochastic physics schemes (SPP, SPPT, and SKEB) outperforms any other combination of two schemes in precipitation forecasting and surface and upper-air verification to better represent the model uncertainties and improve the forecast skill; (3) Combining SKEB with SPP and/or SPPT results in a notable increase in the spread and reduction in outliers for the upper-air wind speed. SKEB directly perturbs the wind field and therefore its addition will greatly impact the upper-air wind-speed fields, and it contributes most to the improvement in spread and outliers for wind; (4) The introduction of SPP has a positive added value, and does not lead to large changes in the evolution of the kinetic energy (KE) spectrum at any wavelength; (5) The introduction of SPPT and SKEB would cause a 5%-10% and 30%-80% change in the KE of mesoscale systems, and all three stochastic schemes (SPP, SPPT, and SKEB) mainly affect the KE of mesoscale systems. This study indicates the potential of combining multiple stochastic physics schemes and lays a foundation for the future development and design of regional and global ensembles.",

  "abstract": "Focusing on the role of initial condition uncertainty, we use WRF initial perturbation ensemble forecasts to investigate the uncertainty in intensity forecasts of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Rammasun (1409), which is the strongest TC to have made landfall in China during the past 50 years. Forecast results indicate that initial condition uncertainty leads to TC forecast uncertainty, particularly for TC intensity. This uncertainty increases with forecast time, with a more rapid and significant increase after 24 h. The predicted TC develops slowly before 24 h, and at this stage the TC in the member forecasting the strongest final TC is not the strongest among all members. However, after 24 h, the TC in this member strengthens much more than that the TC in other members. The variations in convective instability, precipitation, surface upward heat flux, and surface upward water vapor flux show similar characteristics to the variation in TC intensity, and there is a strong correlation between TC intensity and both the surface upward heat flux and the surface upward water vapor flux. The initial condition differences that result in the maximum intensity difference are smaller than the errors in the analysis system. Differences in initial humidity, and to a lesser extent initial temperature differences, at the surface and at lower heights are the key factors leading to differences in the forecasted TC intensity. These differences in initial humidity and temperature relate to both the overall values and distribution of these parameters.",

  "abstract": "For a long time, ballooning instabilities have been believed to be a possible triggering mechanism for the onset of substorm and current disruption initiation in the near-Earth magnetotail. Yet the stability of the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) in a global and realistic magnetotail configuration has not been well examined. In this paper, stability of the KBM is evaluated for the two-dimensional Voigt equilibrium of the near-Earth magnetotail based on an analytical kinetic theory of ballooning instability in the framework of kinetic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, where the kinetic effects such as the finite gyroradius effect, wave-particle resonances, and particle drifts motions are included usually through kinetic closures. The growth rate of the KBM strongly depends on the magnetic field line stiffening factor S, which is in turn determined by the effects of the trapped electrons, the finite ion gyroradius, and the magnetic drift motion of charged particles. The KBM is unstable in a finite intermediate range of equatorial β<SUB>eq</SUB> and only marginally unstable at higher β<SUB>eq</SUB> regime for higher T<SUB>e</SUB>/T<SUB>i</SUB> values. The finite ion gyroradius and the trapped electron fraction enhance the stiffening factor that tends to stabilize the KBM in the magnetotail far away from Earth. On the other hand, the current sheet thinning destabilizes KBM in the lower β<SUB>eq</SUB> regime and stabilizes KBM in the higher β<SUB>eq</SUB> regime.",

  "abstract": "A suite of general circulation models is used to investigate the surface magnetic perturbations due to the ionospheric currents driven by an eastward-propagating ultrafast Kelvin wave (UFKW) packet with periods between 2 and 4 days and zonal wave number s=-1. The simulated daytime UFKW-driven meridional magnetic perturbations dBn (∼±5 nT) (or zonal currents) between about 5° and 20° magnetic latitude in each hemisphere are opposite in sign to those equatorward of ±5° and produced by the equatorial electrojet (EEJ), with the directions on any given day determined by the phase of the UFKW as it propagates eastward with respect to the sunlit ionosphere. Since the nominal daytime Sq zonal current between ∼±30° is uniformly eastward flowing, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that the EEJ is part of a local current vortex with oppositely directed currents near the equator versus those between 5° and 20° at low latitudes. UFKWs are a special wave type wherein meridional winds are relatively small, which leads to our finding that the EEJ dBn constitutes a simple quantitative proxy for E-region UFKW neutral winds near the 107-km peak height of the Hall conductivity, including the variable wave period of the UFKW packet. Numerical experiments are also performed to understand the longitude distribution of actual ground magnetometer measurements that are needed to reliably extract the UFKW dBn signal and hence the neutral winds, both of which are closely linked to plasma drifts and electron densities in the equatorial F region. Using actual magnetometer data it is moreover shown that the UFKW dBn signal is easily measurable. Therefore measurements of EEJ dBn can potentially be used to infer UFKW activity for scientific investigations focusing on coupling between the tropical troposphere and the ionosphere-thermosphere.",

The largest powers above the nominal auroral acceleration region at 5 R<SUB>E</SUB> geocentric were carried by Alfvén waves (1.7 GW) and Alfvénic electrons (0.7 GW), sufficient to account for the conjugate PBI auroral power. In contrast, the conjugate quasistatic, field-aligned current power (&lt;0.3 GW) was not sufficient. Observed correlation between quasiperiodic Alfvénic pulses and auroral modulations strengthens our conclusion that the electromagnetic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling of the PBI was dominantly Alfvénic, as opposed to electrostatic, thus causing Alfvénic aurora.",

In this paper, the distribution of ionosphere electron density with TIDs is constructed using a background ionosphere model superimposed a perturbation theory model. The background ionosphere electron density is modelled by the inversion of vertical incident ionograms which are observed before the appearance of the disturbance. Based on the fourth order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (the so-called ABM) predictor corrector method, instead of Runge-Kutta method, the fast digital ray tracing method is established. According to process of the disturbed trace simulation and parameters inversion, the characteristic parameters of ionosphere disturbance at different detection time can be obtained in real time. The numerical analysis of TIDs is then captured completely.",

  "abstract": "The flowfield inside a combustor of scramjet such as Hyshot II system is highly complicated and many factors have effect on its numerical prediction. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of aerodynamics prediction on Hyshot II intake configuration is performed in this work. The inflow conditions of intake configuration are of vital crucial since they directly determine the inflow conditions of combustor configuration, which in turn have a remarkable influence on the combustion and mixing process. Meanwhile, the varied flight conditions may also introduce great and direct impact on the performance in actual flight tests. It is significant to evaluate the uncertainties and sensitivities and to identify the critical factors of inflow conditions for the intake configuration. Five input parameters are selected as the epistemic uncertain variables. The flowfield prediction is conducted via using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations as the numerical study approach with standard Menter's shear stress transport turbulence model and species transport process for Hyshot II configuration. Stochastic expansions based on point collocation non-intrusive polynomial chaos, which require 42 deterministic simulations in this study, are employed to propagate and estimate the uncertainties. Meanwhile, Sobol indices are adopted to rank and indicate the individual contribution and to identify the critical inflow parameters. The results demonstrate that freestream Mach number and temperature are the dominated contributing parameters among the performance parameters. In addition, as observed from the wall-normal profile of related variables extracted at 355 mm in x coordinate direction in the simulation results, the freestream pressure plays a dominant role in determining the pressure distribution and the freestream temperature is the most prominent contributor to the distribution of temperature and velocity.",

Conjunctive observations of a downward FAC during a substorm on 20 December 2007 were made in space by THEMIS satellites and on the ground by geomagnetic field and aurora stations, which provides a unique opportunity to investigate the generation of downward FAC. On the ground, AL index decreased significantly at 04:17:00 UT, denoting the onset of the substorm. The geomagnetic perturbations observed at the postmidnight station KUUJ show that the FAC of the substorm current wedge flowed into the ionosphere. Meanwhile, in space, two THEMIS satellites, THC and THB, the magnetic footprints of which were close to the postmidnight station KUUJ, were located in the near-Earth magnetotail and recorded the outside-in signatures of the plasma sheet thinning first and then the large-scale inside-out propagating plasma flow vortex inferred from the rotation of the flow vector. The magnitude of the FAC was estimated by using the bipolar B<SUB>Y</SUB> perturbations associated with the flow vortex. It is found that this FAC was so strong that it cannot be produced by the time derivative of the vorticity and that the pressure gradient may act in this event.

  "abstract": "We propose a method for direct diagnostics of a stochastic ionospheric radio channel. This method can recalculate probe signal characteristics into transmitted signal characteristics. We derive analytical equations of second-order statistical moments for trajectory characteristics of the main and probe signals propagating in a three-dimensional randomly inhomogeneous ionosphere. We take into account boundary conditions at signal transmission and reception points. As a model of random irregularities of permittivity of the ionosphere, we utilize the concept of a changing space-time correlation ellipsoid, which is self-consistent with spatial changes in the average ionosphere. Time fluctuations of random irregularities are taken into account by the hypothesis of frozen transfer. We use analytical relationships to calculate the expected statistical characteristics of decameter signals along oblique probing paths of the ionosphere. An operational numerical algorithmization of the formulas derived is proposed. We report results of numerical experiments to determine the expected phase variances, group delay, and Doppler frequency shift of the main signal on a given single-hop path, based on measurements of these characteristics of a probe signal on a secondary path. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method for diagnosing statistical trajectory characteristics of a decameter signal along single-hop paths under conditions when ground points of transmission and reception of the main and probe signals are outside the vicinity of focusing points of the wave field.",

Here, we assess the subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictive skill of the ASL in two state-of-the-art forecasting systems based on the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC). It is found that the ASL predictability during austral spring is higher than in the other seasons with lead times ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. The spring ASL predictability has an ACC of about 0.6 with lead times of 1-2 weeks and about 0.44 with lead times of 3-4 weeks. The enhanced ASL predictability during austral spring is mainly due to the strengthening of stratosphere-troposphere coupling, coincident with a weakened stratospheric polar night jet and increased wave-mean flow interactions in the stratosphere. This study demonstrates that the stratosphere-troposphere coupling provides an important source of predictability for the Antarctic surface weather and climate on S2S timescale.",

  "abstract": "A primary limitation for accurate specification and forecasting of the thermosphere-ionosphere (TI) system is uncertainty in the system forcing. This significantly impacts users who have operational and real-time interests in the current and future state of the TI system. Since Global-Scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) observations are expected to provide information about both the current state and forcing of the TI system, GOLD products could be an operational asset if they could be provided in near real time. Production of GOLD data products requires knowledge of the satellite pointing and location. The current scientific processing implementation contains an operationally significant delay to await definitive location and as-flown pointing. We present the results of a demonstration low-latency processing system that assumes the nominal satellite position and pointing to produce low-latency GOLD data products. The resulting products are reasonably similar to the scientific version but are available within minutes rather than hours.",

  "abstract": "Uncertainty and sensitivity study of three main parameters including length-to-diameter ratio, nozzle radius and total pressure ratio on the drag and heat reduction for the blunt body with spike and opposing jet is conducted. According to the simulation results obtained from the computational fluid dynamics, the relationship between input parameters and aerodynamic force/heat is established via the point-collocation non-intrusive polynomial chaos method. Uncertainties of pressure and heat flux caused by changes of input parameters are quantified. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine key parameters affecting pressure and heat flux changes. The results indicate that changes of peak pressure and peak heat flux are resulted from significant change in reattachment shock strength which varies with input parameters. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the length-to-diameter ratio has huge influence on the uncertainty in the recirculation zone, while the nozzle radius dominates the uncertainty in the reattachment zone. Moreover, it is found that the nozzle radius has an enormous effect on peak pressure and peak heat flux, and a significant negative correlation between them is identified.",

  "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to the solution of optimal control problems under uncertainty (OCPUUs). OCPUUs are first cast in a general formulation that allows the treatment of uncertainties of different nature, and then solved with a new direct transcription method that combines multiple shooting with generalised polynomial algebra to model and propagate extended sets. The continuity conditions on extended sets at the boundary of two adjacent segments are directly satisfied by a bounding approach. The Intrusive Polynomial Algebra aNd Multiple shooting Approach (IPANeMA) developed in this work can handle optimal control problems under a wide range of uncertainty models, including nonparametric, epistemic, and imprecise probability ones. In this paper, the approach is applied to the design of a robust low-thrust trajectory to a Near-Earth Object with uncertain initial conditions. It is shown that the new method provides more robust and reliable trajectories than the solution of an analogous deterministic optimal control problem.",

Results show that daytime SABER CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the upper mesosphere between latitudes 30°S and 50°N is lower in the morning than in the afternoon. The same was found in the lower thermosphere but between latitudes 50°S and 50°N. The opposite was found in the upper mesosphere between 50°S and 30°S. These results are compared to simulations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model-eXtended. It was found that the local-time variations of Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model-eXtended CO<SUB>2</SUB> are weaker than SABER CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Model diagnostics indicated that these local-time variations in the model are driven primarily (secondarily) by strong vertical (meridional) gradients in Upper Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere CO<SUB>2</SUB> volume mixing ratios and strong local-time variations in vertical (meridional) winds. This work concludes that SABER CO<SUB>2</SUB> shows significant local-time variations that are not well simulated by Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model-eXtended, and we suggest that this is likely because of weaker tidal forcing in the model.",

  "abstract": "Uncertainty propagation analysis is crucial to the safety and optimal design of spacecraft structural system in which high accuracy modelling is required. In consideration of convex uncertainties, a vertex combination approach based on the convex set theory is proposed to evaluate the influence of uncertain parameters on the complex eigenvalue of spacecraft structural system with non-proportional damping. The uncertain parameters are dealt with as a closed and bounded convex set. In the proposed method, complex eigenvalue problem with convex uncertainties can be converted into a family of equivalent eigenvalue problems without uncertainties, and the bound evaluation of eigenvalue is conducted by determining the extreme values of the deterministic complex eigenvalue problems. The advantage of this work is easy to integrate with existing codes for large-scale structural system, which allows us to carry out the extension of such deterministic finite element codes to deal with uncertain structural system with complex eigenvalue. Three numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed method.",

To approach and capture the spinning targets in 3D space, the dual-arm space robot could be more efficient and safer than single-arm space robot to carry out the complicated tasks for spinning targets. The paper extends the model of a dual-arm space robot with Reaction Wheels into 3D space, which is more realistic in practice. The desired trajectories for end-effectors of the space robot are designed to securely approach and prepare to capture the spinning object through synchronising with the grasp points, while at the same time the desired attitude of the base could be maintained. Then coordinated control of the base and end-effectors could be carried out by Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) with the consideration of the uncertainties of the space robot system. NMPC has performed with a high accuracy without the uncertainties of the space robot system. Considering the imperfect knowledge of the mass and inertia as the uncertainties, NMPC could hold the accuracy of tracking error at the same level of accuracy in the presence of the uncertainties.",

  "abstract": "Paleoclimate reconstruction relies on estimates of spatiotemporal relationships among climate quantities to interpolate between proxy data. This work quantifies how structural uncertainties in those relationships translate to uncertainties in reconstructions of past climate. We develop and apply a data assimilation uncertainty quantification approach to paleoclimate networks and observational uncertainties representative of data for the last millennium. We find that structural uncertainties arising from uncertain spatial covariance relationships typically contribute 10% of the total uncertainty in reconstructed temperature variability at small (∼200 km), continental, and hemispheric length scales, with larger errors (50% or larger) in regions where long-range climate covariances are least certain. These structural uncertainties contribute far more to errors in uncertainty quantification, sometimes by a factor of 5 or higher. Accounting for and reducing uncertainties in climate model dynamics and resulting covariance relationships will improve paleoclimate reconstruction accuracy.",

  "abstract": "We investigated energy flow in the inner magnetosphere on the basis of the results obtained by a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation. When the magnetosphere is exposed to a southward interplanetary magnetic field, the magnetosphere undergoes quasi-steady convection. Downward (earthward) Poynting flux is found in the polar cap, which is consistent with previous observations. However, Poynting flux appears to be upward (antiearthward) in the equatorward region of the auroral oval. The Region 2 field-aligned current (FAC) is embedded in the upward Poynting flux region. The upward Poynting flux is closely associated with space charge deposited by the ionospheric Hall current under inhomogeneous ionospheric conductivity. The space charge gives rise to shear flow of plasma, which is transmitted upward to the magnetosphere. The shear flow generates additional Region 2 FAC, at least, in the low-altitude magnetosphere. Spatial distribution of the Region 2 FAC appears to depend on altitude, suggesting the significant influence of the ionosphere in the Region 2 FAC region. We traced integral curves of Poynting flux (S curves) backward from a magnetic field line in the Region 2 FAC region and found that the S curves originate either in the solar wind and in the earthward-most boundary of the simulation. These simulation results suggest that the ionosphere participates in the generation of the Region 2 FAC, and the ionosphere is a mediator to feed energy to the inner magnetosphere under the quasi-steady convection.",

  "abstract": "Numerical experiments are performed using a suite of general circulation models that enable the interaction between a Kelvin wave packet and the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) to be elucidated. Focus is on an eastward-propagating ultra-fast Kelvin wave (UFKW) packet with periods between 2 and 4 days and zonal wavenumber s=-1 during day of year (DOY) 266-281, 2009. Dissipative processes modify the classic UFKW dynamics (equatorially trapped, small meridional wind component) in three ways: (1) molecular diffusion acts to spread the UFKW zonal (u) and meridional (v) wind fields meridionally, pole to pole, as u and v, respectively, decay and grow with increasing height; (2) due to molecular diffusion, the UFKW spectrum at longer periods and with shorter vertical wavelengths preferentially dissipates with height; and (3) interaction with the diurnally varying IT introduces a westward-propagating s=+2 component to the wind field that significantly modifies its longitude-UT structure to include a diurnal modulation. The F-region ionosphere also responds with s=+2, which originates from the influence of diurnally varying E-region conductivity on E×B drifts. Additional spectral peaks in v and ionospheric parameters arise due to longitude variations in the magnetic field. Maximum excursions in NmF2 (as compared with those from a simulation without UFKW forcing) achieve values as large as ±50% but more commonly occur in the range of ±20-30%. The combination of positive and negative responses, and their relative magnitudes, depends on the phasing of the UFKW as it moves zonally relative to the Sun-synchronous diurnal variation of the ionosphere, in addition to its changing amplitude between DOY 266 and 282. Modifications of order 10 ms<SUP>-1</SUP> and -7% to zonal-mean zonal winds and NmF2, respectively, also result from dissipation of the UFKW packet.",

  "abstract": "Gravity wave propagation from the troposphere into the thermosphere has often been modeled by assuming a complex vertical wave number m, with the imaginary part accounting for viscous and thermal dissipation. An alternative is to assume a complex wave frequency ω, which leads to a simpler form of the dispersion relation and different wave solutions described by complex-ω ray theory. Here the solutions of complex ω and complex m are analyzed in terms of the compatibility conditions ∇×k=0 and k<SUB>t</SUB>=-∇ω, where k is the wave number vector. Estimates derived here suggest that the complex-ω ray solutions can violate compatibility conditions above altitudes of weak viscosity. A possible consequence of this violation is an overestimation of the viscous damping of thermospheric gravity waves. The present results are based on a numerical solution of the viscous gravity-wave dispersion relation in the anelastic approximation with a Prandtl number of unity and using conventional specifications of the dynamic viscosity of the thermosphere. Theoretical solutions for complex m are also derived in the weak and strong viscosity limits.",

  "abstract": "Forcings from above and below the ionosphere can cause disturbances that need to be detected and corrected for navigation systems. Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) are used to give corrections to aircraft navigation systems while landing. These systems use regional ionosphere monitoring algorithms to detect the anomalies in the ionosphere. The aim of this study is to understand occurrence of ionosphere anomalies and their trends over Turkey. A comprehensive analysis of spatio-temporal variability of ionosphere is carried out for a midlatitude GPS network using Slant Total Electron Content (STEC). Differential Rate Of TEC (DROT), which is a measure of the amount of deviation of temporal derivative of TEC from its trend, is used to detect and classify the level of such disturbances. The GPS satellite tracks are grouped into north, east, west and over directions. The 24 h is divided into six time intervals. The percentage occurrence of each DROT category and the deviation from STEC trend in magnitude are calculated and grouped into satellite track directions and time intervals for 2010 (low solar activity), 2011 and 2012 (medium solar activity). The highest level of disturbances is observed in north and west directions, and during sunrise and sunset hours. The dominant periods of percentage occurrences are diurnal (22-25 h), semidiurnal (12-13 h) and terdiurnal (8-9 h) followed by quasi two-day and quasi 16-day periods. Disturbances corresponding to 50% &lt; DROT &lt; 70% are mostly visible during low solar activity years with magnitudes from 1 to 2 TECU. Geomagnetic storms can cause aperiodic larger scale disturbances that are mostly correlated with DROT &gt; 70%. In 2012, the magnitude of such disturbances can reach 5 TECU. The anisotropic and dynamic nature of midlatitude ionosphere is reflected in the spatio-temporal and spectral distributions of DROT, and their percentage occurrences. This study serves a basis for future studies about development of a regional ionosphere monitoring for Turkey.",

  "abstract": "During northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), irregular magnetic perturbations were observed in the duskside aurora oval via Swarm satellites instead of large-scale Region 1/2 magnetic perturbations. By taking advantage of Swarm constellation measurements, and their conjugate observations with an all-sky imager on the ground, the features of the irregular magnetic perturbations were examined. Detailed analysis of the data from Swarm A and Swarm C for two events demonstrated that the irregular magnetic perturbations are a result of highly structured quasistatic field-aligned currents (FACs), not dynamic Alfvén waves. The typical latitudinal size of the upward FACs is 20-30 km. In each region of the upward FACs, 630-nm aurora emissions are relatively strong, indicating that the energy flux of precipitating electrons having energies of a few hundred electron volts is high in each of the upward FAC regions. The enhanced mesoscale auroras continued to exist for at least approximately 30 min. These indicate that the mesoscale FAC structures also have quasipersistent features. The precipitating particle data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite, which passed through the field of view of the all-sky imager, indicate that the source of the precipitating particles is the duskside low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL). We suggest that the highly structured quasipersistent FACs flow along the magnetic field lines connected to the duskside LLBL where cold dense ions exist. The highly structured FACs in the duskside aurora oval are the phenomena that are pertinent to the magnetosphere for a northward IMF condition, not a simple remnant of the typical Region 1.",

  "abstract": "Formulating model uncertainties for a convection-allowing ensemble prediction system (CAEPS) is a much more challenging problem compared to well-utilized approaches in synoptic weather forecasting. A new approach is proposed and tested through assuming that the model uncertainty should reasonably describe the fast nonlinear error growth of the convection-allowing model, due to the fast developing character and strong nonlinearity of convective events. The Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbation related to Parameters (CNOP-P) is applied in this study. Also, an ensemble approach is adopted to solve the CNOP-P problem. By using five locally developed strong convective events that occurred in pre-rainy season of South China, the most sensitive parameters were detected based on CNOP-P, which resulted in the maximum variations in precipitation. A formulation of model uncertainty is designed by adding stochastic perturbations into these sensitive parameters. Through comparison ensemble experiments by using all the 13 heavy rainfall cases that occurred in the flood season of South China in 2017, the advantages of the CNOP-P-based method are examined and verified by comparing with the well-utilized stochastically perturbed physics tendencies (SPPT) scheme. The results indicate that the CNOP-P-based method has potential in improving the under-dispersive problem of the current CAEPS.",

The main results are as follows. (1) Simultaneous variations were detected in the ionospheric parameters from the E region to the topside ionosphere around the first peak warming of the 2017 SSW. (2) These variations exhibited similar quasi-16-day (Q16D; ~14.5-day) periods, and these periods were most significant just before the first peak warming. (3) These simultaneous Q16D variations were not due to the solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance or geomagnetic activities but were probably driven from below, by planetary waves or semidiurnal lunar tides that enhanced during the SSW. (4) The Q16D variation of the topside ionospheric electron density at ~830 km was probably driven not only by the upward mapping electric field modulated in the E region dynamo but also by the electric field modulated in the F region dynamo.",

In this work, we have assessed the effect of a dense ground network consisting of different radio instruments either developed or under developing on ionosphere nowcasting and forecasting over China and adjacent region (0-60°N and 70-140°E) through observing system simulation experiments. The data assimilation system is an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as a background model. Effects of different observation types, including the slant total electron content from Beidou System geostationary satellite and Global Position System and electron density observations from ionosondes and incoherent scattering radar on the ionospheric nowcasting and forecasting, are examined by the accurate specification of ionosphere key parameters (total electron content and 3-D electron density). We found that simultaneously assimilating different observation types can greatly improve the quality of ionosphere specification. Furthermore, updating the thermospheric state variables in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere forecast model in the assimilation step plays an important role in improving the ionosphere forecasting. The ionosphere forecasting capability can last longer (&gt;24 hr) in each observing system simulation experiment due to the adjusted thermosphere states.

  "abstract": "Studies show that intense lightning discharges can perturb nighttime lower ionosphere through induced electromagnetic fields. We report here new evidence that every lightning stroke, regardless of intensity, has an impact on both daytime and nighttime lower ionosphere. Through analysis of thousands of negative cloud-to-ground lightning strokes in southern China, we find that skywave features of a lightning sferic are closely related to its source intensity. Variations with increasing lightning intensity show a higher reflectivity from nighttime ionosphere but a larger time delay from daytime ionosphere. It also shows that the ionosphere recovers from the lightning impact in a time shorter than tens of milliseconds. This suggests that there exists a direct and fast nonlinear coupling between lightning-generated electromagnetic fields and lower ionosphere, making the ionospheric response to a lightning stroke dependent of the lightning intensity. A candidate mechanism for this is the Joule heating effect, but it needs future studies.",
