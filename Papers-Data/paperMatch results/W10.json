         "abstract": "The capability to forecast conditions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere is investigated based on 30-day hindcast experiments that were initialized bimonthly during 2009 and 2010. The hindcasts were performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. Analysis of the WACCMX+DART hindcasts reveals several important features that are relevant to forecasting the middle atmosphere. The results show a clear dependence on spatial scale, with the slowest error growth occurring in the zonal mean and the fastest error growth occurring for small-scale waves. The error growth rate is also found to be significantly greater in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere compared to in the upper stratosphere to lower mesosphere, suggesting that the forecast skill decreases with increasing altitude. The results demonstrate that the errors in the lower thermosphere reach saturation, on average, in less than 5 days, at least with the current version of WACCMX+DART. A seasonal dependency to the error growth is found at high latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres but not in the tropics or global average. We additionally investigate the error growth rates for migrating and nonmigrating atmospheric tides and find that the errors saturate after \u223c5 days for tides in the lower thermosphere. The results provide an initial assessment of the error growth rates in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere and are relevant for understanding how whole atmosphere models can potentially improve space weather forecasting.",

         "abstract": "Accurate specification of the thermosphere states is crucial to the low Earth orbit satellite operation. In this work, the impact of different ionosphere and thermosphere observing systems on the improvement of neutral temperature of the data assimilation model has been investigated by a series of observing system simulation experiments. The selected observations include the Global Navigation Satellite System total electron content (e.g., MIT vertical total electron content [VTEC]) and the daytime Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) level-2 disk temperature (T<SUB>disk</SUB>). Such observations are ingested into the coupled ionosphere and thermosphere model based on our developed ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation systems on the basis of the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. The main findings are as follows: (a) A considerable improvement of the neutral temperature estimation of the physical-based model can be obtained in the global region by assimilating either the MIT VTEC or the GOLD T<SUB>disk</SUB> observations; (b) the assimilation of the GOLD can further contribute to temperature improvement in the lower thermosphere (&lt;200 km), relative to the MIT VTEC assimilation; and (c) simultaneously assimilating both observation types can better improve the quality of neutral temperature estimation over the global area during the whole data assimilation process. The current results demonstrate that assimilating GOLD observations is important to improve the forecast capability of the physical-based model for the lower thermosphere states and can provide a possible reference for the joint assimilation of the ionosphere and thermosphere observations to better thermosphere specification.",

         "abstract": "Accurate ionospheric specification for the current and future is one of the key tasks in operational space weather. In this work, we have assessed the effect of a dense ground network consisting of different radio instruments either developed or under developing on ionosphere nowcasting and forecasting over China and adjacent region (0-60\u00b0N and 70-140\u00b0E) through observing system simulation experiments. The data assimilation system is an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as a background model. Effects of different observation types, including the slant total electron content from Beidou System geostationary satellite and Global Position System and electron density observations from ionosondes and incoherent scattering radar on the ionospheric nowcasting and forecasting, are examined by the accurate specification of ionosphere key parameters (total electron content and 3-D electron density). We found that simultaneously assimilating different observation types can greatly improve the quality of ionosphere specification. Furthermore, updating the thermospheric state variables in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere forecast model in the assimilation step plays an important role in improving the ionosphere forecasting. The ionosphere forecasting capability can last longer (&gt;24 hr) in each observing system simulation experiment due to the adjusted thermosphere states. This study can provide a reference for observing system design over the China region and future ionosphere forecasting operation.",

         "abstract": "&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Abstract Ionospheric day-to-day variability is a ubiquitous feature, even in the absence of appreciable geomagnetic activities. Although meteorological perturbations have been recognized as an important source of the variability, it is not well represented in previous modeling studies and the mechanism is not well understood. This study demonstrates that the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) constrained in the stratosphere and mesosphere by the hourly whole atmosphere community climate model (WACCM) simulations is capable of reproducing observed features of day-to-day variability in the thermosphere-ionosphere. Realistic weather patterns in the lower atmosphere in WACCM were specified by Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis for Research and Application (MERRA). The day-to-day variations in mean zonal wind, migrating and nonmigrating tides in the thermosphere, vertical and zonal E \u00d7 B drifts, and ionosphere F2 layer peak electron density (NmF2) are examined. The standard deviations of the drifts and NmF2 show local time and longitudinal dependence that compare favorably with observations. Their magnitudes are 50% or more of those from observations. The day-to-day thermosphere and ionosphere variability in the model is primarily caused by the perturbations originated in lower atmosphere, since the model simulation is under constant solar minimum and low geomagnetic conditions.",

         "abstract": "In early 2014, continuous monitoring with the Hisaki satellite discovered transient auroral emission at Jupiter during a period when the solar wind was relatively quiet for a few days. Simultaneous imaging made by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) suggested that the transient aurora is associated with a global magnetospheric disturbance that spans from the inner to outer magnetosphere. However, the temporal and spatial evolutions of the magnetospheric disturbance were not resolved because of the lack of continuous monitoring of the transient aurora simultaneously with the imaging. Here we report the coordinated observation of the aurora and plasma torus made by Hisaki and HST during the approach phase of the Juno spacecraft in mid-2016. On day 142, Hisaki detected a transient aurora with a maximum total H<SUB>2</SUB> emission power of 8.5 TW. The simultaneous HST imaging was indicative of a large \"dawn storm,\" which is associated with tail reconnection, at the onset of the transient aurora. The outer emission, which is associated with hot plasma injection in the inner magnetosphere, followed the dawn storm within less than two Jupiter rotations. The monitoring of the torus with Hisaki indicated that the hot plasma population increased in the torus during the transient aurora. These results imply that the magnetospheric disturbance is initiated via the tail reconnection and rapidly expands toward the inner magnetosphere, followed by the hot plasma injection reaching the plasma torus. This corresponds to the radially inward transport of the plasma and/or energy from the outer to the inner magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "It has long been recognized that during solar eclipses, the ionosphere-thermosphere system changes greatly within the eclipse shadow, due to the rapid reduction of solar irradiation. However, the concept that a solar eclipse impacts polar ionosphere behavior and dynamics as well as magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling has not been appreciated. In this study, we investigate the potential impact of the 21 August 2017 solar eclipse on the polar tongue of ionization (TOI) using a high-resolution, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics model. The reduction of electron densities by the eclipse in the middle latitude TOI source region leads to a suppressed TOI in the polar region. The TOI suppression occurred when the solar eclipse moved into the afternoon sector. The Global Positioning System total electron content observations show similar tendency of polar region total electron content suppression. This study reveals that a solar eclipse occurring at middle latitudes may have significant influences on the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

         "abstract": "Based on the ensemble spread, a methodology of measuring uncertainty in weather forecasts, the temperature trend and spread have been estimated using five radiosonde data sets and seven reanalysis products beginning in 1989. The results show that the magnitude of warming or cooling depends on the data sources, atmospheric heights, and geophysical latitudes. Over low-middle latitudes, the cooling varies from -2.6 K/decade in NCEP-DOE to -0.8 K/decade in HADAT2 in the lower stratosphere. The warming weakly changes from 0.2 through 0.4 K/decade in the middle troposphere. Over Antarctica, there is a pronounced warming in the low-middle troposphere in the three NCEP reanalyses and the RATPAC radiosonde data sets, and cooling in the other eight products. Over the Arctic, the warming is observed from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere in all twelve data sets. Significant cooling is identified over the middle stratosphere (above 50 hPa) in all five radiosondes. For global mean temperature, the trend is approximately 0.2 K/decade in the troposphere and -0.8 K/decade in the stratosphere. The spread increases significantly with atmospheric height from approximately 0.1 K/decade at 850hPa to 0.8 K/decade at 30hPa. The spread in the reanalysis data sets is much larger than in the radiosondes in the stratosphere. In contrast, the spread in both the reanalysis and radiosondes data sets is very small and shows the trend in better agreement with each other in the troposphere.",

         "abstract": "Policy makers need reliable future climate projection for adaptation purposes. A clear separation of sources of uncertainty also helps narrow the projection uncertainty. However, it remains unclear for monsoon precipitation projections. Here we quantified the contributions of internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty to the ensemble spread of global land monsoon precipitation projections using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). For mean precipitation, model uncertainty (contributing ~90%) dominates the projection uncertainty, while the contribution of internal variability (scenario uncertainty) decreases (increases) with time. The source of uncertainty for extreme precipitation differs from that of mean precipitation mainly in long-term projection, with the contribution of scenario uncertainty comparable to model uncertainty. Reducing model uncertainty can effectively narrow the monsoon precipitation projection. The internal variability estimates differ slightly among models and methods, the uncertainty partitioning is robust in middle-long term.",

         "abstract": "Steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events occur during enhanced solar wind driving of the magnetosphere and are characterized by quasi-stable convection, without any substorm expansions, for several hours. Previous research has hinted that a substorm onset may be required before the magnetosphere can enter the SMC mode of response. For the first time, we show statistically that nearly all SMC events are preceded by a substorm. Only 1% of SMC events occur without any preceding substorm signatures. The typical magnetospheric reaction to enhanced solar wind driving is a substorm. After this occurs, we find that the duration and stability of southward IMF determines whether a particular substorm will transition into an SMC event or not. The initial substorm sets up a high pressure region in the inner magnetosphere that causes flux diversion to the flanks, which allows closed flux from the nightside x-line to return to balance the dayside reconnection rate.",

         "abstract": "Wave aurora produces broadband particle acceleration. For many years, this type of signature was anecdotally but widely thought to occur primarily at the poleward edge of the auroral oval. Recent statistical work has found that, on the contrary, for strong solar wind driving, broadband aurora is common throughout the auroral oval. Of particular interest is the occurrence of wave aurora below 68 degrees MLAT. We have studied the dependence of such signatures, both as a function of solar wind driving, and as a function of substorm cycle. A set of about 1800 substorm onsets identified by Polar UVI, along with 116 isolated substorm onsets, were used for superposed epoch analysis. The results show that the wave aurora has a very strong substorm cycle dependence, rising dramatically in the first few minutes after onset, and peaking about 10-15 minutes later. By contrast, wave aurora has no easily identifiable solar wind driving peak, although the general trend is for wave aurora to become more common with higher driving (as do substorms themselves). This evidence adds to previous circumstantial evidence associating wave aurora particularly with substorms (for example, wave auroral power is much more strongly peaked in the premidnight region than is monoenergetic or \u201cinverted-V\u201d aurora).",

         "abstract": "This paper compares results from a whole atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model, GAIA, with the COSMIC and TIMED/SABER observations during the 2008/2009 northern winter season. The GAIA model has assimilated meteorological reanalysis data by a nudging method. The comparison shows general agreement in the major features from the stratosphere to the ionosphere including the growth and decay of the major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event in 2009. During this period, a pronounced semidiurnal variation in the F region electron density and its local-time phase shift similar to the previous observations are reproduced by the model and COSMIC observation. The model suggests that the electron density variation is caused by an enhanced semidiurnal variation in the E \u00d7 B drift, which is probably related to an amplified semidiurnal migrating tide (SW2) in the lower thermosphere. The model and TIMED/SABER observation show that the SW2 tide amplifies at low latitudes from the stratosphere to the thermosphere as well as the phase variation. Possible mechanisms for the SW2 variability in the low latitude stratosphere could be the change of its propagation condition, especially the (2, 2) mode, due to changing zonal background wind and meridional temperature gradient, and/or an enhancement of its source due to redistribution of stratospheric ozone. Present results also show a prominent long-term variation of the terdiurnal migrating component (TW3) in the ionosphere and atmosphere.",

         "abstract": "The only previously established seasonal auroral variation is that of intense monoenergetic aurora, corresponding to quasi-static acceleration by geomagnetic-field-aligned electric fields. Here we investigate the separate seasonal dependence of both types of electron accelerated aurora (broadband, or wave, in addition to monoenergetic) and both ion and electron diffuse aurora. Dayside and nightside variations are separately considered, as are conditions of low and high solar wind driving. Across these many combinations, several clear patterns emerge. One is that the dayside tends to maximize precipitation in the summer and much more so for low solar wind driving. Nightside precipitation is higher in the winter and much more so for high solar wind driving. The dayside effects are strongest in number flux and stronger in diffuse aurora than accelerated aurora. The ease of ion entry through the summer cusp, along with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality, and the rise in dayside currents in the summer hemisphere adequately explain much (perhaps all) of the dayside behavior. Nightside effects are more apparent in energy flux, with the winter/summer ratio of monoenergetic aurora being the largest: 1.70 for high solar wind driving. However, both other types of electron aurora, diffuse (1.30) and broadband (1.26), also have winter/summer energy fluxes well above unity for high solar wind driving. The nightside seasonal variation of ions is much smaller, with slightly more energy flux postmidnight in the winter but with slightly higher energy fluxes premidnight in the summer. Since the increased nightside fluxes into the winter hemisphere occur primarily under strong solar wind driving, and are much more prominent in energy flux than number flux, they likely reflect increased energization in the winter ionosphere when stronger currents are being driven into the ionosphere from the magnetosphere. Equinoctial behavior tends to lie between the summer and winter hemisphere values, but typically closer to the latter. As a result, nightside electron energy flux summed over the hemispheres is higher around equinox, simply because there is no summer hemisphere.",

         "abstract": "A Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) has been used to explore the possible physical connection between a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) and the dynamics and electrodynamics of the lower thermosphere. WAM produces SSWs naturally without the need for external forcing. The classical signatures of an SSW appear in the model with a warming of the winter polar stratosphere, a reversal of the temperature gradient, and a breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex. Substantial changes in the amplitude of stationary planetary wave numbers 1, 2, and 3 occur as the zonal mean zonal wind evolves. The simulations also show a cooling in the mesosphere and a warming in the lower thermosphere consistent with observations. The magnitude of this particular SSW is modest, belonging to the category of minor warming. In the lower thermosphere the amplitude of diurnal, semidiurnal, and terdiurnal, eastward and westward propagating tidal modes change substantially during the event. Since the magnitude of the warming is minor and the tidal interactions with the mean flow and planetary waves are complex, the one-to-one correspondence between tidal amplitudes in the lower thermosphere and the zonal mean and stationary waves in the stratosphere is not entirely obvious. The increase in the magnitude of the terdiurnal tide (TW3) in the lower thermosphere has the clearest correlation with the SSW, although the timing appears delayed by about three days. The fast group velocity of the long vertical wavelength TW3 tide would suggest a faster onset for the direct propagation of the tide from the lower atmosphere. It is possible that changes in the magnitude of the diurnal and semidiurnal tides, with their slower vertical propagation, may interact in the lower thermosphere to introduce a terdiurnal tide with a longer delay. An increase in TW3 in the lower thermosphere would be expected to alter the local time variation of the electrodynamic response. The day-to-day changes in the lower thermosphere winds from WAM are shown to introduce variability in the magnitude of dayside low latitude electric fields, with a tendency during the warming for the dayside vertical drift to be larger and occur earlier, and for the afternoon minimum to be smaller. The numerical simulations suggest that it is quite feasible that a major SSW, with a magnitude seen in January 2009, could cause large changes in lower thermosphere electrodynamics and hence in total electron content.",

         "abstract": "Statistical results on the global distribution of suprathermal electron (0.1-10 keV) fluxes are shown both outside and inside the plasmasphere separately, using electron data from THEMIS. Significant electron fluxes are found within the plasmasphere, although they are nevertheless smaller than the populations outside the plasmasphere. Electron fluxes outside of the plasmapause increase with stronger magnetic activity on the nightside and decrease as a function of increasing magnetic local time (MLT). Inside the plasmasphere, electron fluxes increase just inside of the plasmapause, particularly from the midnight to the dawn sector during active times, while electron distributions are less MLT-dependent during quiet times. Inside the plasmasphere, electron fluxes are larger and more stable at smaller L shells at higher energy (a few to 10 keV), while electron fluxes decrease at smaller L shells at lower energy (less than a few keV). Our new statistical results on the suprathermal electron distribution both inside and outside the plasmasphere provide essential information for the evaluation of wave propagation characteristics. Case analyses have been performed in order to understand potential mechanisms responsible for electron access into the plasmasphere. The first case analysis shows that during a relatively quiet time following a disturbed interval, deeply injected suprathermal electrons remain trapped at low L shells during the refilling of the plasmasphere and eventually form the plasmaspheric population. The second case analysis suggests that a combination of locally enhanced electric field and subsequent energy-dependent azimuthal magnetic drift may be able to trap the suprathermal electrons inside the plasmasphere during a geomagnetically active period.",

         "abstract": "Discrete aurora at Mars, characterized by their small spatial scale and tendency to form near strong crustal magnetic fields, are emissions produced by particle precipitation into the Martian upper atmosphere. Since 2014, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN's (MAVEN's) Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) has obtained a large collection of UV discrete aurora observations during its routine periapsis nightside limb scans. Initial analysis of these observations has shown that, near the strongest crustal magnetic fields in the southern hemisphere, the IUVS discrete aurora detection frequency is highly sensitive to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle. However, the role of other solar wind properties in controlling the discrete aurora detection frequency has not yet been determined. In this work, we use the IUVS discrete aurora observations, along with MAVEN observations of the upstream solar wind, to determine how the discrete aurora detection frequency varies with solar wind dynamic pressure, IMF strength, and IMF cone angle. We find that, outside of the strong crustal field region (SCFR) in the southern hemisphere, the aurora detection frequency is relatively insensitive to the IMF orientation, but significantly increases with solar wind dynamic pressure, and moderately increases with IMF strength. Interestingly however, although high solar wind dynamic pressures cause more aurora to form, they have little impact on the brightness of the auroral emissions. Alternatively, inside the SCFR, the detection frequency is only moderately dependent on the solar wind dynamic pressure, and is much more sensitive to the IMF clock and cone angles. In the SCFR, aurora are unlikely to occur when the IMF points near the radial or anti-radial directions when the cone angle (arccos(B<SUB>x</SUB>/|B|)) is less than 30\u00b0 or between 120\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. Together, these results provide the first comprehensive characterization of how upstream solar wind conditions affect the formation of discrete aurora at Mars.",

         "abstract": "The magnetosheath operates as a natural filter between the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma. As a result of this, the magnetosheath plays a crucial role in the plasma momentum and energy transport from the interplanetary medium into the magnetosphere. Statistical studies of the magnetosheath are difficult due to the dynamic nature of the terrestrial bow shock and the magnetopause. As a result of this, the spatial and temporal dependence of magnetosheath plasma properties under varying solar wind conditions is still not completely understood. We present a study of magnetosheath plasma properties using 5 years of THEMIS and OMNI data to produce statistical maps of fundamental magnetosheath plasma properties. The magnetosheath interplanetary medium reference frame is applied to present data in a normalized reference frame which accounts for both boundary and orbital motion. The statistical maps are compared with the MHD runs from the CCMC-BATS-R-US model which agree favorably. The results are also used to investigate the presence of any magnetosheath plasma parameter asymmetries and their possible causes.",

         "abstract": "A number of recent studies have highlighted the observational evidence for a coupling between atmospheric tides in the thermosphere and the electron density structure of the ionosphere. The most commonly proposed mechanism to explain this is an electrodynamic coupling between tides at E region altitudes and ion drifts at F region altitudes. However, based on both the observational evidence from recent satellite missions such as those of the neutral winds associated with nonmigrating tides at F region altitudes, and considering the theoretical effects of atmospheric tides on the thermosphere and ionosphere, more than one coupling mechanism must be considered. We use Sami2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere to test a set of electrodynamic and chemical-dynamical coupling mechanisms that could explain the link between tides in the thermosphere and the low-latitude ionosphere. We investigate the possible role of the vertical drifts during the both the day and around sunset, perturbations to the thermospheric neutral density and thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], and tidal winds at F region altitudes. These simulations give an estimate of the sensitivity of the nighttime ionosphere to each of these coupling mechanisms. We then compare the results of these sensitivity tests with the effects of atmospheric tides on different thermospheric parameters as simulated by a self-consistent model of the atmosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamic system (thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model). This comparison shows that in addition to the E region dynamo modulation, the potential coupling between tides and the ionosphere via changes in thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], meridional winds at F region altitudes, and modification of the vertical drifts around sunset could play an important role and all require further study, both with models and new observations.",

         "abstract": "Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) simulations are used to investigate solar and lunar tide changes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) that occur in response to sudden stratosphere warmings (SSWs). The average tidal response is demonstrated based on 23 moderate to strong Northern Hemisphere SSWs. The migrating semidiurnal lunar tide is enhanced globally during SSWs, with the largest enhancements (\u223c60-70%) occurring at mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Enhancements in the migrating solar semidiurnal tide (SW2) also occur up to an altitude of 120 km. Above this altitude, the SW2 decreases in response to SSWs. The SW2 enhancements are 40-50%, making them smaller in a relative sense than the enhancements in the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide. Changes in nonmigrating solar tides are, on average, generally small and the only nonmigrating tides that exhibit changes greater than 20% are the diurnal tide with zonal wave number 0 (D0) and the westward propagating semidiurnal tide with zonal wave number 1 (SW1). D0 is decreased by \u223c20-30% at low latitudes, while SW1 exhibits a similar magnitude enhancement at mid to high latitudes in both hemispheres. The tidal changes are attributed to a combination of changes in the zonal mean zonal winds, changes in ozone forcing of the SW2, and nonlinear planetary wave-tide interactions. We further investigate the influence of the lunar tide enhancements on generating perturbations in the low latitude ionosphere during SSWs by using the WACCM-X thermosphere to drive an ionosphere-electrodynamics model. For both solar maximum and solar minimum simulations, the changes in the equatorial vertical plasma drift velocity are similar to observations when the lunar tide is included in the simulations. However, when the lunar tide is removed from the simulations, the low latitude ionosphere response to SSWs is unclear and the characteristic behavior of the low latitude ionosphere perturbations that is seen in observations is no longer apparent. Our results thus indicate the importance of variability in the lunar tide during SSWs, especially for the coupling between SSWs and perturbations in the low latitude ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "We investigate whether induction within Callisto's electrically conductive ionosphere can explain observed magnetic fields which have previously been interpreted as evidence of induction in a saline, electrically conductive subsurface ocean. Callisto's ionosphere is subject to the flow of time-periodic magnetized plasma of Jupiter's magnetosphere, which induces electric fields and electric currents in Callisto's electrically conductive ionosphere. We develop a simple analytic model for a first quantitative understanding of the effects of induction in Callisto's ionosphere caused by the interaction with a time-variable magnetic field environment. With this model, we also investigate how the associated ionospheric currents close in the ambient magnetospheric plasma. Based on our model, we find that the anisotropic nature of Callisto's ionospheric conductivity generates an enhancement effect on ionospheric loop currents which are driven by the time-variable magnetic field. This effect is similar to the Cowling channel effect known from Earth's ionosphere. Subsequently, we numerically calculate the expected induced magnetic fields due to Jupiter's time-variable magnetic field in an anisotropic conductive ionosphere and compare our results with the Galileo C-3 and C-9 flybys. We find that induction within Callisto's ionosphere is responsible for a significant part of the observed magnetic fields. Ionospheric induction creates induced magnetic fields to some extent similar as expected from a subsurface water ocean. Depending on currently unknown properties such as Callisto's nightside ionosphere, the existence of layers of \"dirty ice\" and the details of the plasma interaction, a water ocean might be located much deeper than previously thought or might not exist at all.",

         "abstract": "Steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events in the Earth's magnetosphere are thought to result from balancing the rate of opening flux through solar wind-magnetosphere reconnection at the dayside magnetopause to the rate of closing flux through reconnection in the magnetotail. For this to occur, reconnected flux in the tail must return to the dayside to balance the dayside reconnection rate. Using Geotail and THEMIS data over a span of 14 years, we examine the average plasma conditions and fast Earthward flows during SMC intervals and compare them to other types of geomagnetic activity, such as quiet intervals, isolated substorm phases, and the two hours before an SMC (Pre-SMC intervals). We show that the average total pressure in the inner magnetosphere is higher during SMC events than for other types of activity. This higher pressure region extends to larger radial distances, and causes fast Earthward flows to divert toward the dawn or dusk flanks and continue to the dayside. This pattern is contrasted to substorms, during which flows are directed toward the inner magnetosphere and flux remains there in the \u201cpile-up region.\u201d We suggest that the SMC pattern of flow deflection carries enough flux from the tail to the dayside to allow for balanced reconnection. Finally, the Pre-SMC intervals have plasma conditions that are similar to, but slightly weaker than, SMC events. Since most SMCs begin with a substorm, this indicates that preconditioning of the magnetosphere by prior geomagnetic activity is important in setting up the magnetotail for an SMC state.",

         "abstract": "We introduce a new model to study Jupiter's magnetosphere and how it interacts with the solar wind. We first derive a set of one-fluid MHD equations to consistently include the ion-neutral collisions in Jupiter's ionosphere and the mass loading in the Io torus. The mass loading and the subsequent radial mass transport in Jupiter's magnetosphere leads to a deviation from full corotation of the magnetospheric plasma. Ion-neutral collisions in Jupiter's ionosphere and subsequent transport of angular momentum out into the magnetosphere acts to spin up the magnetosphere's plasma. Our model explicitly includes mass loading in the Io plasma torus and an inner boundary region, which represents the effects of Jupiter's ionosphere. We present the results of five model runs where different mass loading rates and ionospheric conductances are used. For these model runs, we consider an antiparallel interplanetary magnetic field and a strong solar wind dynamic pressure, resulting in a compressed magnetosphere. The results are compared with analytical models, in situ measurements, and remote-sensing observations. Our azimuthal velocity profiles and the position of the corotation breakdown are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions by Hill (1979, 2001) and Saur et al., (2004a), and Voyager observations. The total current flowing into and out of the ionosphere is 48.7 MA, which is in agreement with estimates from measurements and analytical models. Using the field aligned electric current j<SUB>\u2225</SUB> to determine the position of the aurorae, we find that our main auroral oval is associated, as expected, with the position of the corotation breakdown (between 20.6 R<SUB>J</SUB> and 30.1 R<SUB>J</SUB> for the different model runs). The discontinuity in the main oval observed by Radioti et al. (2008) is also present in our results, where it is caused by an asymmetry in the pressure distribution, due to the interaction between the rotating plasma and the magnetopause.",

         "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the ionosphere is an important source of ions in the magnetosphere and until recently this population has largely been neglected from many global simulations. In this study, a causally regulated cusp O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow is added to the multifluid version of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global simulation. The cusp outflow algorithm uses empirical relationships to regulate the outflow flux with further conditioning to isolate the outflow spatially to a dynamic cusp. The impact cusp O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow has on the magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) system is investigated for a moderate storm on 31 August 2005. It is found the MI system response depends upon the specification of the outflow velocity and temperature. More energetic outflow tends to flow downtail whilst colder, slower outflow fills the inner magnetosphere. High O<SUP>+</SUP> densities in the inner magnetosphere can increase the strength of the ring current, reducing Dst and inflating the magnetosphere. This effect is mostly found for the less energetic outflow specification. O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow is found to reduce the access of solar wind ions to the inner magnetosphere, which, through the MI coupling in LFM reduces the precipitating electron power, conductance and field-aligned currents. The effect outflow has on the cross polar cap potential (CPCP) depends upon two competing factors. The reduction in Region I currents when outflow is present appears to increase the CPCP whilst the inflation of the magnetosphere due to an enhanced ring current decreases the CPCP.",

         "abstract": "We compared the global plasmaspheric total electron content (pTEC) with the ionospheric TEC (iTEC) simultaneously measured by Jason-1 satellite during the declining phase of solar cycle 23 (2002-2009) to investigate the global morphology of the plasmaspheric density in relation to the ionosphere. Our study showed that the plasmaspheric density structures fundamentally follow the ionosphere, but there are also significant differences between them. Although the diurnal variations are very similar to each region, the plasmasphere shows much weaker variations, only approximately 1 TECU day-night difference. By analyzing the day-night differences in the plasmasphere, we found that the plasmaspheric contribution to the nighttime ionosphere does not increase with solar activity and the largest contribution occurs during June solstice. The plasmasphere shows similar seasonal variations to the ionosphere, except for the semiannual variation, which is essentially absent in the plasmasphere. There is also an important difference in the annual variation: although the annual variation in the ionosphere exists regardless of longitude, it occurs only at American sector in the plasmasphere. As solar activity increases to moderate level, the pTEC substantially enhances from approximately 2 to 4 TECU at the initial increase of solar activity below F10.7p = 100 and then quickly slows down while the iTEC almost linearly enhances. Although it is well known that magnetic storms are the major source of plasmaspheric density depletion, pTEC does not show this aspect of the plasmasphere probably due to the relatively small K<SUB>p</SUB> values for high magnetic activity (K<SUB>p</SUB> &gt; 2.5) in the current study.",

         "abstract": "The substorm mechanism is investigated by analyzing the numerical results obtained through the use of the recently refined magnetohydrodynamic model. After showing the growth phase features, the numerical solution reproduces the observed signatures of a substorm onset, including the formation of a near-Earth neutral line (NENL), earthward directed flow in the plasma sheet, a dipolarization, a geosynchronous D deflection, the development of the nightside field aligned currents (FACs), and electrojets in the ionosphere. The onset is triggered by a sudden collapse of the plasma sheet and a successive formation of a high-pressure region in the inner magnetosphere. The energy source of this high-pressure region is the magnetic tension released from the NENL. The tail disturbance is primary transmitted to the ionosphere by the region 2 FAC accompanying the high-pressure region formed in the inner magnetosphere. The associated nightside region 1 FAC is not connected to the traditional current wedge but to the cusp region. The region 1 FAC path to the ionosphere develops from dayside to nightside, so as to construct a grand loop with the region 2 FAC from the partial ring current. In the grand loop, the region 1 FAC provides a short circuit in the ionosphere for the region 2 FAC. In the expansion phase, convection enhances to relax the distorted pressure distribution formed at the onset, accompanied by a further development of dipolarization and a thickening of the plasma sheet in the magnetosphere and increases in the westward and eastward electrojets in the ionosphere. The present model can explain the explosive growth phase and the thinning of the midtail plasma sheet just after the onset.",

We compare R against the composite sunspot group data from the Royal Greenwich Observatory network and the Solar Optical Observing Network, using both the number of sunspot groups, N<SUB>G</SUB>, and the total area of the sunspots, A<SUB>G</SUB>. In addition, we compare R with the recently developed interdiurnal variability geomagnetic indices IDV and IDV(1d). In all four cases, linearity of the relationship with R is not assumed and care is taken to ensure that the relationship of each with R is the same before and after the putative calibration change. It is shown the probability that a correction is not needed is of order 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and that R is indeed too low before 1945. The optimum correction to R for values before 1945 is found to be 11.6%, 11.7%, 10.3%, and 7.9% using A<SUB>G</SUB>, N<SUB>G</SUB>, IDV, and IDV(1d), respectively. The optimum value obtained by combining the sunspot group data is 11.6% with an uncertainty range 8.1-14.8% at the 2\u03c3 level. The geomagnetic indices provide an independent yet less stringent test but do give values that fall within the 2\u03c3 uncertainty band with optimum values are slightly lower than from the sunspot group data. The probability of the correction needed being as large as 20%, as advocated by Svalgaard (2011), is shown to be 1.6 \u00d7 10<SUP>-5</SUP>.",

         "abstract": "We present observations of proton aurora at Mars made using the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) onboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft. Martian proton aurora display a prominent intensity enhancement in the hydrogen Lyman-alpha (121.6 nm) emission between ~110 and 150 km altitude. Using altitude-intensity profiles from periapsis limb scan data spanning nearly two Martian years, we create a comprehensive database of proton aurora and characterize their phenomenology. Due to Mars' lack of a global dipole magnetic field, Martian proton aurora are expected to form on the dayside via electron stripping and charge exchange between solar wind protons and the neutral corona. We observe proton aurora in ~14% of dayside periapsis profiles (with notable seasonal variability), making proton aurora the most commonly observed type of aurora at Mars. We determine that the primary factors influencing proton aurora occurrence rates are solar zenith angle and season. The highest proton aurora occurrence rates are at low solar zenith angles on the Mars dayside, consistent with known formation processes. Proton aurora have highest emission enhancements, peak intensities, peak altitudes, and occurrence rates (nearing 100%) around southern summer solstice. This time period corresponds with the seasonal inflation of the neutral lower atmosphere, the onset of Martian dust storm season, seasonally increased coronal hydrogen column densities, and higher atmospheric temperature and solar wind flux following perihelion. The results of our study provide a new understanding of the primary factors influencing proton aurora, and the long-term variability of these phenomena as observed over multiple Mars years.",

         "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail converts open magnetic flux to closed, producing fast flows in the plasma sheet. Earthward fast flows can thus be used as a proxy for energy and momentum transfer into the closed magnetosphere during the course of a substorm. Characteristics of flows observed before substorm onset can provide information on the role of the flows in substorm onset triggering as well as the sequence of substorm-related processes. We use 15 years of data obtained by Geotail, Cluster, and THEMIS to study statistically the distribution of earthward plasma sheet flows during substorms. Substorm phases are determined from time series of the AL index and the z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field. We find that the occurrence frequency of medium-speed (100 km/s &lt; V &lt; 500 km/s) flows increases slightly toward the end of the substorm growth phase. At substorm onset there is a sharp increase of medium-speed flows, and during substorm recovery there is a gradual decrease of such flows. The occurrence frequency of high-speed (V &gt; 500 km/s) flows, on the other hand, does not clearly increase during the substorm growth phase. The increase at substorm onset is more gradual than for the medium-speed flows. The occurrence frequency of high-speed flows peaks at the beginning of substorm recovery. These results indicate that any effect of the flows on substorm onset triggering would be caused by medium rather than very high speed flows.",

         "abstract": "Auroral substorms are often associated with optical ray or bead structures during initial brightening (substorm auroral onset waves). Occurrence probabilities and properties of substorm onset waves have been characterized using 112 substorm events identified in Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imager data and compared to Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E) and kinetic instability properties. All substorm onsets were found to be associated with optical waves, and thus, optical waves are a common feature of substorm onset. Eastward propagating wave events are more frequent than westward propagating wave events and tend to occur during lower-latitude substorms (stronger solar wind driving). The wave propagation directions are organized by orientation of initial brightening arcs. We also identified notable differences in wave propagation speed, wavelength (wave number), period, and duration between westward and eastward propagating waves. In contrast, the wave growth rate does not depend on the propagation direction or substorm strength but is inversely proportional to the wave duration. This suggests that the waves evolve to poleward expansion at a certain intensity threshold and that the wave properties do not directly relate to substorm strengths. However, waves are still important for mediating the transition between the substorm growth phase and poleward expansion. The relation to arc orientation can be explained by magnetotail structures in the RCM-E, indicating that substorm onset location relative to the pressure peak determines the wave propagation direction. The measured wave properties agree well with kinetic ballooning interchange instability, while cross-field current instability and electromagnetic ion cyclotron instability give much larger propagation speed and smaller wave period.",

         "abstract": "Substorms release a large amount of energy, some of which is used to energize the precipitating particles in the polar region. Superposed epoch analysis was performed with 11 years of DMSP SSJ/4/5 data to characterize the substorm cycle of the diffuse, monoenergetic, and broadband/wave precipitating electrons and precipitating ions. Although substorms only increase the ion pressure by 30%, they increase the power of the diffuse, monoenergetic, and wave electron aurora by 310%, 71%, and 170%, respectively. Substorms energize the ion aurora mainly in the 21:00-05:00 magnetic local time (MLT) sector. The dynamics of the diffuse electron aurora are different from those of the other two electron aurorae. The expansion phase duration is approximately 15 min for the monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae, whereas it is 1 h for the diffuse electron aurora. The monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae appear to complete the substorm cycle within a 5 h interval, whereas the diffuse electron aurora takes more than 5 h. The diffuse electron aurora power and energy flux start increasing at 15 min before the substorm onset, whereas those for the monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae start increasing at 1 h and 15 min before the onset. The increase in the monoenergetic electron aurora power and energy flux may result from the increase in the magnetotail stretching and region-1 field-aligned current during the growth phase. The monoenergetic electrons may also be associated with fast flows, which have been previously observed more frequently in the dusk-midnight sector.",

         "abstract": "We investigate localized magnetosheath and solar wind density enhancements, associated with clear magnetic field changes, and therefore referred to as magnetosheath/solar wind plasmoids, respectively. Using Cluster data, we show that there are two distinct populations of magnetosheath plasmoids, one associated with a decrease of magnetic field strength (diamagnetic plasmoids), and one with an increased magnetic field strength (paramagnetic plasmoids). The diamagnetic magnetosheath plasmoids have scale sizes of the order of 1-10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, while the paramagnetic ones are an order of magnitude smaller. The diamagnetic plasmoids are not associated with any change in the magnetosheath plasma flow velocity, and they are classified as embedded plasmoids in the terminology of Karlsson et al. (2012). The paramagnetic plasmoids may either be embedded or associated with increases in flow velocity (fast plasmoids). A search for plasmoids in the pristine solar wind resulted in identification of 62 diamagnetic plasmoids with very similar properties to the magnetosheath diamagnetic plasmoids, making it probable that the solar wind is the source of these structures. No paramagnetic plasmoids are found in the pristine solar wind, indicating that these are instead created at the bow shock or in the magnetosheath. We discuss the relation of the plasmoids to the phenomenon of magnetosheath jets, with which they have many properties in common, and suggest that the paramagnetic plasmoids can be regarded as a subset of these or a closely related phenomenon. We also discuss how the results from this study relate to theories addressing the formation of magnetosheath jets.",

         "abstract": "We analyze an isolated substorm on 29 March 2009 observed by the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and well monitored by ground-based observatories at and near station Gillam. The event provides a rare opportunity for monitoring the substorm magnetic topology thanks to fortuitous clustering of the THEMIS probes, complemented by the GOES 12 spacecraft. The neutral sheet position was found to be displaced by \u223c0.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> northward from its average location. The peak cross-tail current density was estimated to be \u223c20 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP> at the end of the growth phase, revealing the formation of a thin current sheet during the last 15 min prior to the expansion onset. The fortuitous spacecraft conjunction allowed us to construct an adjusted time-varying model based on magnetic field and pressure observations during the substorm. We then used the adjusted model to map the location of the spacecraft to the ionosphere and the breakup from the ionosphere to the equatorial region. Significant time-dependent differences between this and the standard models (e.g., T96) do exist, resulting in breakup mapping to \u223c22 R<SUB>E</SUB>, compared to 12 R<SUB>E</SUB> if classical models are used. Moreover, we find that spacecraft footprints in the ionosphere move significantly equatorward (2\u00b0) over tens of minutes during the growth phase but jump poleward (2\u00b0-4\u00b0) after expansion onset. Since such motions are also typical for auroral arcs during substorms, we infer that magnetic field reconfiguration during various substorm phases, rather than plasma motion in the equatorial magnetosphere, is largely responsible for the observed motion of the aurora.",

         "abstract": "Observational properties of throat aurora are investigated in detail by using 7 year continuous auroral observations obtained at Yellow River Station (magnetic latitude 76.24\u00b0N). From our inspection, throat aurora is often observed under the condition of stripy diffuse aurora contacting with the persistent discrete auroral oval, and the long-period throat aurora observations generally consist of intermittent subsequences of throat aurora brightening followed by poleward moving auroral form and throat aurora dimming. We also noticed that the orientation of throat aurora is aligned along the ionospheric convection flow, and its local time distribution shows clear dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>y</SUB> component. These observational results indicate that factors inside the magnetosphere may play important role on occurrence of throat aurora. We thus suggest that throat aurora may present the ionospheric signature of redistribution of reconnection rate on the magnetopause by cold magnetospheric plasma flowing into the reconnection site. In addition, we also found that the occurrence rate of throat aurora clearly decreases with increase of the IMF cone angle (arccos(|B<SUB>x</SUB>|/B)), which is very similar with the occurrence rate of high-speed jet (HSJ) observed in magnetosheath depending on the IMF cone angle. This is suggested as that the HSJs occurred outside the magnetosphere may also play important role for generation of throat aurora by triggering magnetopause reconnection or by direct impacting. Although further studies are needed to clarify how the throat auroras are generated in detail, the relevant observations about throat aurora have presented important implications on a variety open questions, such as distribution and generation of cold plasma structures in the outer magnetosphere, magnetopause deformation, and possible relation between HSJ and reconnection.",

The COSMIC observations reveal the presence of distinct longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC, and these further exhibit a seasonal and local time dependence. The predominant feature observed at all local times in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC is a substantial maximum (minimum) during Northern Hemisphere winter (summer) around 300\u00b0-360\u00b0 geographic longitude. Around equinox, at a fixed local time, a wave 4 variation in longitude prevails in the daytime F region TEC as well as the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC. The wave 4 variation in longitude persists into the nighttime in the F region; however, the nighttime topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC exhibits two maxima in longitude. The COSMIC observations clearly reveal the presence of substantial longitude variations in the F region and topside ionosphere-plasmasphere, and to elucidate the source of the longitude variations, results are presented based on the coupling between the Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere model and the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. The model simulations demonstrate that the orientation of the geomagnetic field plays a fundamental role in generating significant longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere but does not considerably influence longitude variations in the F region ionosphere. The model results further confirm that nonmigrating tides are the primary mechanism for generating longitude variations in the F region ionosphere. The coupled model additionally demonstrates that nonmigrating tides are also of considerable importance for the generation of longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC.",

         "abstract": "Recent observations from the 2-D array of high-resolution THEMIS all-sky imagers (ASIs) during the 2008 tail season have shown that the majority of substorm onsets are preceded by equatorward extension of an auroral arc initiated at the poleward boundary of the aurora zone, and that the aurora breakup is likely triggered when this precursor arc reaches the onset region. These observations were used to suggest that substorm onset is driven by a new population of plasma having lower global entropy content than that of the preexisting plasma intruding into the inner plasma sheet. We have taken advantage of conjunctions between the location of the precursor arc observed by the THEMIS ASI and THEMIS spacecraft and identified four events where clear signatures of the proposed new plasma intrusion were observed simultaneously in both the magnetotail and ionosphere. In two of the events, the intrusion plasma was captured more than 10 min before substorm onset in the midtail plasma sheet. The intruding plasma is characterized as the reduction of the pressure and entropy parameter associated with more dipolarized magnetic field, as well as the enhancement of the duskward electric field and earthward flow. In two other events, the plasma intrusion was found within 2 min before onset in the inner plasma sheet region R \u223c11 R<SUB>E</SUB>, which is very close to the onset locations. These observations are consistent with the proposal that intrusion of low-entropy content plasma to the onset region may provide a trigger for substorm onset. We also found two plasma intrusion events not associated with substorm onset in the plasma sheet, which indicates that the new plasma intrusion is not a sufficient condition for substorm onset. We suggest that sufficient pressure and azimuthal pressure gradient buildup in the inner plasma sheet during growth phase should be another necessary condition.",

         "abstract": "We combine 4861 identifications of substorm onsets from satellite global imagers (Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV) with DMSP particle data to investigate the substorm cycle dependence of the diffuse aurora (electrons and ions), monoenergetic aurora (produced by quasi-static electric fields), and broadband aurora (associated with Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration). Although all types of aurora increase at substorm onset, broadband aurora shows a particular association with substorms and, especially, substorm onset. While diffuse electron and monoenergetic auroral precipitating power rises by 79% and 90%, respectively, following an onset, wave aurora rises by 182%. In the first 10-15 min following onset, the power associated with Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration is comparable to monoenergetic acceleration (also called \u201cinverted V\u201d events). In general, this is not the case before onset, or indeed, during recovery. The rise time of the electron diffuse aurora following onset is much slower, about 50 min, and thus presumably extends into recovery. Discrete acceleration, which rises over just a few minutes, is already deep into decline, while diffuse auroral power is still rising. Most of the sharp increase in Alfv\u00e9nic precipitating power at onset is associated with a 132% jump in the characteristic energy associated with broadband acceleration. Previous work has associated PiB signatures (which are compressional) in the magnetotail with dipolarization. More recently, FAST observations near the auroral zone have been used to show that there are nearly simultaneous sharp increases in Alfv\u00e9n waves, apparently created by mode coupling. The present work strongly supports the idea that the Alfv\u00e9nic aurora has a particular connection to substorm onsets, with much of the auroral power over a substorm cycle concentrated shortly after onset. Finally, a superposed epoch analysis of commonly used coupling functions indicates a drop in the mean solar wind driving starting 20 min before substorm onset. However, the distribution of increases and decreases in solar wind driving is roughly symmetric about a peak at zero (no change) but with (rare) large drops in solar wind driving (\u201cnorthward turnings\u201d) outweighing large increases. Comparison with the distribution of random changes in solar wind driving leads us to suggest that probably only a minority of substorms are externally driven.",

Made by the UVIS imager on the Cassini spacecraft, these observations differ from previous UV observations of Saturn's aurora by offering complete local time coverage of the aurora from small zenith angles. A statistical picture emerges after combining over 10<SUP>5</SUP> spectrographic images of the north and south aurora. From its composite, the northern aurora exhibits an intensity peak of \u223c40 kR near 05 h local time, while the southern aurora peaks at \u223c60 kR near the same local time. Aurora intensities in the post-noon sectors are essentially constant at \u223c10 kR. The half-power points of latitudinal profiles reveal widths of \u223c4\u00b0 near dawn and \u223c8\u00b0 near dusk in both north and south. The aurora has an approximately circular shape (not oval!), although harmonic fits suggest the northern aurora is more nearly circular than the southern. The center of the northern aurora has an offset of \u223c1-2\u00b0 from the pole, while the southern center is offset by \u223c2-3\u00b0, with both offsets in the midnight-to-dawn quadrant. When mapped to the polar regions, precipitation of field-aligned energetic electrons (&gt;20 keV) generally lies equatorward of the main auroral intensity at all local times.",

         "abstract": "Motivated by recent event studies and modeling efforts on pulsating aurora, which conclude that the precipitation energy during these events is high enough to cause significant chemical changes in the mesosphere, this study looks for the bulk behavior of auroral pulsations. Based on about 400 pulsating aurora events, we outline the typical duration, geomagnetic conditions, and change in the peak emission height for the events. We show that the auroral peak emission height for both green and blue emission decreases by about 8 km at the start of the pulsating aurora interval. This brings the hardest 10% of the electrons down to about 90 km altitude. The median duration of pulsating aurora is about 1.4 h. This value is a conservative estimate since in many cases the end of event is limited by the end of auroral imaging for the night or the aurora drifting out of the camera field of view. The longest durations of auroral pulsations are observed during events which start within the substorm recovery phases. As a result, the geomagnetic indices are not able to describe pulsating aurora. Simultaneous Antarctic auroral images were found for 10 pulsating aurora events. In eight cases auroral pulsations were seen in the southern hemispheric data as well, suggesting an equatorial precipitation source and a frequent interhemispheric occurrence. The long lifetimes of pulsating aurora, their interhemispheric occurrence, and the relatively high-precipitation energies make this type of aurora an effective energy deposition process which is easy to identify from the ground-based image data.",

         "abstract": "The foreshock region involves localized and transient structures such as foreshock cavities and hot flow anomalies due to solar wind-bow shock interactions, and foreshock transients have been shown to lead to magnetospheric and ionospheric responses. In this paper, the interaction between a foreshock transient and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system is investigated using dayside aurora imagers revealing structures and propagation in greater detail than previously possible. A foreshock transient was detected by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms B and C during 1535-1545 UT on 25 June 2008. Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms A, D, and E observed magnetopause compression, cold plasma enhancement, and ultralow frequency waves in the dayside magnetosphere. The all-sky imager at South Pole observed that both diffuse and discrete aurora brightened locally soon after the appearance of this foreshock transient. The diffuse aurora brightening, which corresponded to a region a few Re size in geocentric solar magnetospheric Y in the equatorial plane, propagated duskward with an average speed of 100 km/s. Soon after the diffuse aurora brightened, discrete aurora also brightened and extended duskward, which was consistent with the motion of the foreshock transient as it swept through the magnetosheath while impacting the magnetopause. Equivalent horizontal currents measured by magnetometers revealed a pair of field-aligned currents moving duskward consistent with motion of the discrete aurora patterns. We conclude that the high-resolution and two-dimensional observation of auroral responses by ground-based all-sky imager can help to estimate the evolution and propagation of upstream foreshock transients and their substantial impacts on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system, including magnetospheric compression and currents in the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "The observations made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft in the topside (\u2265200 km) ionosphere of Mars show that this region is very responsive to the variations of the external (solar extreme ultraviolet flux, solar wind, and interplanetary magnetic field [IMF]) and internal (the crustal magnetic field) drivers. With the growth of the solar irradiance the ionosphere broadens while with increase of the solar wind dynamic pressure it shrinks. As a result, the upper ionospheric boundary at solar zenith angles of 60-70\u00b0 can move from \u223c400 to \u223c1,200 km. Similar trends are observed at the nightside ionosphere. At P<SUB>dyn</SUB> \u2265 1-2 nPa the nightside ionosphere becomes very fragmented and depleted. On the other hand, the ion density in the nightside ionosphere significantly (up to a factor of 10) increases with the rise of the solar extreme ultraviolet flux. Large-amplitude motions of the topside ionosphere also occur with variations of the value of the cross-flow component of the IMF. The upper dayside ionosphere at altitudes of more than 300-400 km is sensitive also to the direction of the cross-flow component of the IMF or, correspondingly, to the direction of the motional electric field in the solar wind. The ionosphere becomes very asymmetrical with respect to the V<SUB>sw</SUB>\u00d7B<SUB>IMF</SUB> direction and the asymmetry strongly enhances at the nightside. The topside ionosphere above the areas with strong crustal magnetic field in the dayside southern hemisphere is significantly denser and expands to higher altitudes as compared to the ionosphere above the northern nonmagnetized lowlands. The crustal magnetic field also protects the nightside ionosphere from being filled by plasma transported from the dayside. The draping IMF penetrates deeply into the ionosphere and actively influences its structure. Weak fields and, correspondingly, weak magnetic field forces only slightly affect the ionosphere. With increase of the induced magnetic field strength the transport motions driven by the magnetic field pressure and field tensions seem to be intensified and we observe that the local ion densities at the dayside considerably decrease. A different trend is observed at the nightside. The ion density in the nightside ionosphere above the northern lowlands is higher than in the southern hemisphere indicating that plasma transport from the dayside is the main source of the nightside ionosphere. Nonstop variations in the solar wind, the IMF and the solar irradiance together with planetary rotation of the crustal magnetic field sources lead to a continuous expansion/shrinking and reconfiguration of the topside ionosphere of Mars.",

         "abstract": "Magnetosheath high-speed jets (HSJs) are dayside upstream transient disturbances with enhanced flow velocity and dynamic pressure. They are associated with significant magnetopause perturbations, ultralow frequency waves in the dayside magnetosphere, and localized flow enhancements in the ionosphere. However, whether HSJs have corresponding dayside aurora signatures is still an open question. If auroral signatures are found, 2-D structure and evolution of HSJ effects on the magnetosphere can be imaged in a much higher precision than possible by other means. In this study, eight HSJ events are identified by the THEMIS satellites located within \u00b11 MLT of the center of the field-of-view of the South Pole station all-sky imager. In all of those cases, the HSJs are observed to have a nearly one-to-one relationship with individual localized discrete/diffuse auroral brightenings. The azimuthal size of HSJ-related diffuse aurora signatures is 800 km at 230-km altitude in the ionosphere and 3.7 Re in the magnetosphere, which is slightly larger but of the order of the cross-sectional diameter of HSJs ( 1 Re). Furthermore, most of those aurora signatures have azimuthal motion, whose magnitude and direction agree with magnetosheath background flows. This study for the first time shows high-resolution, two-dimensional observations of localized structure and fast propagation of precipitation due to magnetosheath HSJs. We conclude that magnetosheath HSJs can have substantial impacts on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system, causing localized magnetospheric compression and aurora brightening, in a similar manner to responses during interplanetary shocks except with a smaller scale size.",

         "abstract": "The subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) are one of the most important features in representing magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art modeling framework that couples an inner magnetospheric ring current model RAM-SCB with a global MHD model Block-Adaptive Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and an ionospheric potential solver to study the SAPS that occurred during the 17 March 2013 storm event as well as to assess the modeling capability. Both ionospheric and magnetospheric signatures associated with SAPS are analyzed to understand the spatial and temporal evolution of the electrodynamics in the midlatitude regions. Results show that the model captures the SAPS at subauroral latitudes, where Region 2 field-aligned currents (FACs) flow down to the ionosphere and the conductance is lower than in the higher-latitude auroral zone. Comparisons to observations such as FACs observed by Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), cross-track ion drift from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and in situ electric field observations from the Van Allen Probes indicate that the model generally reproduces the global dynamics of the Region 2 FACs, the position of SAPS along the DMSP, and the location of the SAPS electric field around L of 3.0 in the inner magnetosphere near the equator. The model also demonstrates double westward flow channels in the dusk sector (the higher-latitude auroral convection and the subauroral SAPS) and captures the mechanism of the SAPS. However, the comparison with ion drifts along DMSP trajectories shows an underestimate of the magnitude of the SAPS and the sensitivity to the specific location and time. The comparison of the SAPS electric field with that measured from the Van Allen Probes shows that the simulated SAPS electric field penetrates deeper than in reality, implying that the shielding from the Region 2 FACs in the model is not well represented. Possible solutions in future studies to improve the modeling capability include implementing a self-consistent ionospheric conductivity module from inner magnetosphere particle precipitation, coupling with the thermosphere-ionosphere chemical processes, and connecting the ionosphere with the inner magnetosphere by the stronger Region 2 FACs calculated in the inner magnetosphere model.",

It appears to have been magnetically connected to both magnetosphere and magnetosheath. The layer appears to be located mostly on closed field lines and was bounded by a rotational discontinuity (RD) at its magnetosheath edge and by the magnetosphere on its earthward side. A separatrix layer, with heated magnetosheath electrons streaming unidirectionally along the field lines, was present sunward of the RD. We infer that the layer was started by a dominant reconnection site well north of the spacecraft and that it may have gained additional width, from a large drop in solar wind density and ram pressure, which preceded the beginning of the event by more than an hour. Relative to the magnetosheath, in which the magnetic field was strongly southward, this unusual layer was characterized by a less southward, more dawnward magnetic field of lower magnitude. The plasma density and flow speed in the region were lower than in the magnetosheath, albeit with Alfv\u00e9nic jetting occurring at the magnetosheath edge as well as at the magnetospheric edge of the layer. The closing of the magnetic field lines requires the existence of another reconnection site, located southward/tailward of MMS.",

         "abstract": "Pulsating aurora is a common phenomenon generally believed to occur mainly in the aftermath of a substorm, where dim long-period pulsating patches appear. The study determines the temporal and spatial evolution of pulsating events using two THEMIS all-sky imager stations, at Gillam (66.18 magnetic latitude, 332.78 magnetic longitude, magnetic midnight at 0634 UT) and Fort Smith, (67.38 magnetic latitude, 306.64 magnetic longitude, magnetic midnight at 0806 UT) along roughly the same invariant latitude. Parameters have been calculated from a database of 74 pulsating aurora events from 119 days of good optical data within the period from September 2007 through March 2008 as identified with the Gillam camera. It is shown that the source region of pulsating aurora drifts or expands eastward, away from magnetic midnight, for premidnight onsets and that the spatial evolution is more complicated for postmidnight onsets, which has implications for the source mechanism. The most probable duration of a pulsating aurora event is roughly 1.5 h, while the distribution of possible event durations includes many long (several hours) events. This may suggest that pulsating aurora is not strictly a substorm recovery phase phenomenon but rather a persistent, long-lived phenomenon that may be temporarily disrupted by auroral substorms. Observations from the Gillam station show that in fact, pulsating aurora is quite common with the occurrence rate increasing to around 60% for morning hours, with 69% of pulsating aurora onsets occurring after substorm breakup.",

Both the COSMIC observations and TIME-GCM simulations reveal perturbations in the &lt;fi&gt;F&lt;/fi&gt; region peak height (h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) at Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes during SSW time periods. The perturbations are \u223c20-30 km, which corresponds to 10-20% variability of the background mean h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>. The TIME-GCM simulations and COSMIC observations of the h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability are in overall good agreement, and the simulations can thus be used to understand the physical processes responsible for the h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability. Through comparison of simulations with and without the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M<SUB>2</SUB>), we conclude that the midlatitude h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability is primarily driven by the propagation of the M<SUB>2</SUB> into the thermosphere where it modulates the field-aligned neutral winds, which in turn raise and lower the &lt;fi&gt;F&lt;/fi&gt; region peak height. Though there are subtle differences, the consistency of the behavior between the 2009 and 2013 SSWs suggests that variability in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude ionosphere and thermosphere is a consistent feature of the SSW impact on the upper atmosphere.",

Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is required to understand its role in energy redistribution in the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In previous theoretical descriptions of precipitated magnetospheric electrons (E\u223c 1 keV), the major focus has been the ionization and excitation rates of the neutral atmosphere and the energy deposition rate to thermal ionospheric electrons. However, these precipitating electrons will also produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. This paper presents the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E&lt; 600 eV) and their ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling processes. In this article, we discuss for the first time how diffuse electron precipitation into the atmosphere and the associated secondary electron production participate in ionosphere-magnetosphere energy redistribution.",

         "abstract": "Magnetospheric substorms represent a major energy release process in Earth's magnetosphere. Their duration and intensity are coupled to solar wind input, but the precise way the solar wind energy is stored and then released is a matter of considerable debate. Part of the observational difficulty has been the gaps in the auroral electrojet index traditionally used to study substorm properties. In this study, we created a midlatitude positive bay (MPB) index to measure the strength of the substorm current wedge. Because this index is based on midlatitude magnetometer data that are available continuously over several decades, we can assemble a database of substorm onsets lasting 31 years (1982-2012). We confirmed that the MPB onsets have a good agreement (\u00b12 min) with auroral onsets as determined by optical means on board the IMAGE mission and that the MPB signature of substorms is robust and independent of the stations' position relative to ionospheric currents. Using the MPB onset, expansion, and recovery as a proxy of the respective substorm quantities, we found that the solar cycle variation of substorm occurrence depends on solar wind conditions and has a most probable value of 80 min. In contrast, the durations of substorm expansion and recovery phases do not change with the solar cycle. This suggests that the frequency of energy unloading in the magnetosphere is controlled by solar wind conditions through dayside reconnection, but the unloading process related to flux pileup in the near-Earth region is controlled by the magnetosphere and independent of external driving.",

         "abstract": "The precipitation of high-energy magnetospheric electrons (E \u223c 600 eV-10 KeV) in the diffuse aurora contributes significant energy flux into the Earth's ionosphere. To fully understand the formation of this flux at the upper ionospheric boundary, \u223c700-800 km, it is important to consider the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In the diffuse aurora, precipitating electrons initially injected from the plasma sheet via wave-particle interaction processes degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These precipitating electrons can be additionally reflected upward from the two conjugate ionospheres, leading to a series of multiple reflections through the magnetosphere. These reflections greatly influence the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km) and the resultant population of secondary electrons and electrons cascading toward lower energies. In this paper, we present the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E &lt; 600 eV) and its energy interplay in the magnetosphere and two conjugated ionospheres. This solution takes into account, for the first time, the formation of the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region, beginning with the primary injection of plasma sheet electrons via both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves and whistler mode chorus waves to the loss cone, and including their subsequent multiple atmospheric reflections in the two magnetically conjugated ionospheres. It is demonstrated that magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is key in forming the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region.",

         "abstract": "Observations of a pulsating aurora event occurring on 11 February 2008, using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) All-Sky Imager (ASI) array, indicate a spatially and temporally continuous event with a duration of greater than 15 h and covering a region with a maximum size of greater than 10 h magnetic local time. The optical pulsations are at times locally interrupted or drowned out by auroral substorm activity but are observed in the same location once the discrete aurora recedes. The pulsations following the auroral breakup appear to be brighter and have a larger patch size than before breakup. This suggests that, while the onset of pulsating aurora is not necessarily dependent upon a substorm precursor, the pulsations are affected and possibly enhanced by the substorm process. The long duration of this pulsating aurora event, lasting approximately 8 h without interruption as imaged from Gillam station, is significantly longer than the typical 2-3 h substorm recovery phase, suggesting that pulsating aurora is not strictly a recovery phase phenomenon. This paper is accompanied by a movie of the THEMIS ASI array data, from 0000 to 1715 UT, plotted in mosaic and superimposed onto a map of North America.",

         "abstract": "The extreme substorm event on 5 April 2010 (THEMIS AL = -2,700 nT, called supersubstorm) was investigated to examine its driving processes, the aurora current system responsible for the supersubstorm, and the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T) responses. An interplanetary shock created shock aurora, but the shock was not a direct driver of the supersubstorm onset. Instead, the shock with a large southward IMF strengthened the growth phase with substantially larger ionosphere currents, more rapid equatorward motion of the auroral oval, larger ionosphere conductance, and more elevated magnetotail pressure than those for the growth phase of classical substorms. The auroral brightening at the supersubstorm onset was small, but the expansion phase had multistep enhancements of unusually large auroral brightenings and electrojets. The largest activity was an extremely large poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and subsequent auroral streamer, which started ~20 min after the substorm auroral onset during a steady southward IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> and elevated dynamic pressure. Those were associated with a substorm current wedge (SCW), plasma sheet flow, relativistic particle injection and precipitation down to the D-region, total electron content (TEC), conductance, and neutral wind in the thermosphere, all of which were unusually large compared to classical substorms. The SCW did not extend over the entire nightside auroral activity but was localized azimuthally to a few 100 km in the ionosphere around the PBI and streamer. These results reveal the importance of localized magnetotail reconnection for releasing large energy accumulation that can affect geosynchronous satellites and produce the extreme M-I-T responses.",

We study the response of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system to a 25% reduction in magnetic field intensity, using the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (CMIT) model. Simulations were performed with a dipole moment of 8 \u00d7 10<SUP>22</SUP> A m<SUP>2</SUP>, close to the present-day value, and a dipole moment of 6 \u00d7 10<SUP>22</SUP> A m<SUP>2</SUP>, both under the same solar wind conditions, intermediate solar activity (F10.7 = 150), and for March equinox and June solstice. The 25% reduction in field strength causes the magnetosphere to shrink and the polar cap to expand, in agreement with theory. The Pedersen and the Hall ionospheric conductances increase by 50%-60% and 60%-65%, respectively. This causes a \u223c9%-12% decrease in electric potential and a \u223c20% increase in field-aligned currents during equinox. Ion E \u00d7 B drift velocities are enhanced by \u223c10%-15%. The Joule heating also increases, by 13%-30%, depending on the season. Changes in the neutral temperature structure are caused partly by changes in Joule heating and partly by changes in the neutral wind. The neutral wind itself is also affected by changes in neutral temperature and by changes in ion velocities. The changes in the neutral wind, together with changes in the vertical component of the E \u00d7 B drift, affect the height of the ionospheric F2 layer. Changes in electron density are related to changes in the O/N<SUB>2</SUB> ratio. The global mean increase in neutral temperature causes the thermosphere to expand, resulting in a global mean uplift of the ionosphere. These effects are generally smaller during solstice.",

         "abstract": "The ionization of neutral material ejected by Jupiter's volcanically active moon, Io, results in a plasma disc that extends from Io's orbit out through the Jovian magnetosphere. This magnetospheric plasma is coupled to the planetary ionosphere via currents which flow along the magnetic field. Inside of \u223c40 R<SUB>J</SUB>, these currents transfer angular momentum from the planet to the magnetospheric plasma, in an attempt to keep the plasma rigidly corotating with the planet. Jupiter's main auroral emission is a signature of this current system. To date, one-dimensional models of Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling have either assumed a dipole field or used a field description appropriate to the postmidnight region of the Jovian magnetosphere. Vogt et al. (2011) described the variation of the N-S component of the magnetic field in the center of the current sheet, B<SUB>N</SUB>, with local time and radius. We apply a 1-D model of Jupiter's M-I current system every hour in local time using a modified description of the Vogt et al. (2011) magnetic field to investigate how local time variations in the magnetosphere affect the auroral currents and plasma angular velocity. Our model predicts the strongest aurora at dawn, with a minimum in the auroral currents existing from noon through dusk. This is a few hours duskward of the discontinuity predicted by Radioti et al. (2008). While our model predictions are consistent with some of the observations, future MI coupling models must account for the azimuthal bendback in the magnetic field.",

The atmospheric reanalysis is based on implementation of data assimilation in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. The tidal variability in the WACCM+DART reanalysis is compared to the observed variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) based on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics satellite Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (TIMED/SABER) observations, in the ionosphere based on Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations, and in the upper thermosphere (\u223c475 km) based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density observations. To obtain the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT and upper thermosphere, we apply the method of tidal deconvolution to the TIMED/SABER observations and consider the difference in the ascending and descending longitudinal wave number 4 structure in the GRACE observations. The results reveal that tidal amplitude changes of 5-10 K regularly occur on short timescales (\u223c10-20 days) in the MLT. Similar variability occurs in the WACCM+DART reanalysis and TIMED/SABER observations, demonstrating that the short-term variability can be captured in whole atmosphere models that employ data assimilation and in observations by the technique of tidal deconvolution. The impact of the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT on the ionosphere and thermosphere is also clearly evident in the COSMIC and GRACE observations. Analysis of the troposphere forcing in WACCM+DART and simulations of the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) show that the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT is not related to a single source; rather, it is due to a combination of changes in troposphere forcing, zonal mean atmosphere, and wave-wave interactions.",

The present study investigates the source of the global N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> decrease by performing numerical experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model. The simulations reveal that the N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> reduction coincides with a depletion of thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], indicating that the N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> depletion is related to changes in thermospheric composition during SSWs. Numerical experiments further illustrate that the short-term (\u223c10 day) enhancement of the migrating semidiurnal solar tide (SW2) during SSWs is the source of the variability in thermospheric composition. In particular, the enhancement of the SW2 during SSWs alters the lower thermosphere zonal mean circulation, leading to a reduction in atomic oxygen in the lower thermosphere. The atomic oxygen reduction propagates into the upper thermosphere through molecular diffusion, leading to a decrease in [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>] throughout the low- to middle-latitude thermosphere. It is anticipated that the effects of the SW2 on the ionosphere and thermosphere investigated herein will be modulated by SSW related enhancements of the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M2). The magnitude of the combined impact of the SW2 and M2 on the ionosphere-thermosphere mean state will depend on the relative phasing of the solar and lunar tides. The results demonstrate that in addition to modulating the low-latitude electrodynamics, tidal variability during SSWs can significantly impact the mean state of the ionosphere and thermosphere.",

These recently discovered neutral metal layers in the thermosphere between 100 and 200 km provide unique tracers for studies of fundamental processes in the space-atmosphere interaction region. The TIFe model formulates and expands the TIFe theory originally proposed by Chu et al. that the thermospheric Fe layers are produced through the neutralization of converged Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers. Through testing mechanisms and reproducing the 28 May 2011 event at McMurdo, we conceive the lifecycle of meteoric metals via deposition, transport, chemistry, and wave dynamics for thermospheric Fe layers with gravity wave signatures. While the meteor injection of iron species is negligible above 120 km, the polar electric field transports metallic ions Fe<SUP>+</SUP> upward from their main deposition region into the E-F regions, providing the major source of Fe<SUP>+</SUP> (and accordingly Fe) in the thermosphere. Atmospheric wave-induced vertical shears of vertical and horizontal winds converge Fe<SUP>+</SUP> to form dense Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers. Direct electron-Fe<SUP>+</SUP> recombination is the major channel to neutralize Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers to form Fe above 120 km. Fe layer shapes are determined by multiple factors of neutral winds, electric field, and aurora activity. Gravity-wave-induced vertical wind plays a key role in forming gravity-wave-shaped Fe layers. Aurora particle precipitation enhances Fe<SUP>+</SUP> neutralization by increasing electron density while accelerating Fe loss via charge transfer with enhanced NO<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> densities.&lt;abstract type=\"synopsis\"&gt;&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Plain Language SummaryThe discoveries of neutral metal layers reaching near 200 km in the thermosphere have significant scientific merit because such discoveries challenge the current understandings of upper atmospheric composition, chemistry, dynamics, electrodynamics, and energetics. Furthermore, these neutral metal layers provide tracers for direct measurements of the neutral properties in the least understood but crucially important space-atmosphere interaction region in the altitude range of 100-200 km. With a thermosphere-ionosphere Fe/Fe<SUP>+</SUP> (TIFe) model developed from first principles at the University of Colorado, we present the first quantitative investigation of formation mechanisms of thermospheric Fe layers observed by lidar in Antarctica. The TIFe model formulates the TIFe theory depicting the lifecycle of meteoric metals via deposition, transport, chemistry, and wave dynamics. Antarctic lidar observations were successfully reproduced with the TIFe model simulations. These TIFe layers provide a unique natural laboratory for understanding the fundamental processes critical to advancing the research of space-atmosphere interactions.",

The anisotropic pressure of draped magnetosheath magnetic field lines and the inclusion of a reconnection-generated standing slow mode wave fan bounded by a rotational discontinuity within the definition of the magnetotail result in cross sections elongated in the direction parallel to the component of the IMF in the plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line. Tilted cross-tail plasma sheets separate the northern and southern lobes within these cross sections. Greater fast-mode speeds perpendicular than parallel to the draped magnetosheath magnetic field lines result in greater distances to the bow shock in the direction perpendicular than parallel to the component of the IMF in the plane transverse to the Sun-Earth line. The magnetotail cross section responds rapidly to variations in the IMF orientation. The rotational discontinuity associated with newly reconnected magnetic field lines requires no more than the magnetosheath convection time to appear at any distance downstream, and further adjustments of the cross section in response to the anisotropic pressures of the draped magnetic field lines require no more than 10-20 min. Consequently, for typical ecliptic IMF orientations and strengths, the magnetotail cross section is oblate, while the bow shock is prolate.",

         "abstract": "evaluate whether ground magnetic responses traditionally viewed as signatures of substorm onset may be related to postonset auroral streamers rather than to substorm onset seen in aurora, we have analyzed ground magnetic and all-sky image responses for 14 substorm onsets selected solely on imager coverage. We find evidence supporting this possibility, the response being approximately coincident for midlatitude positive bay and Pi2 pulsation enhancements and for abrupt auroral zone H decreases at stations near a streamer. These are all signatures of current wedge formation, indicating that substorm current wedge formation may be more of a response to plasma sheet flow channels associated with postonset streamers than to the process leading to auroral onset and that the current wedge may develop via a series of distinctly narrower wedge-like structures. We also find evidence that periods of streamers can occur more than once during a substorm expansion phase and can give magnetic signatures of multiple onsets even if there are no additional auroral onsets. Furthermore, the peak auroral zone H decreases are seen in association with streamers and at times varying from just a few minutes to well over a half hour after substorm auroral onset if there is a prolonged period of streamers. This indicates that peak substorm AE and AL values are likely related to features of postonset streamers and their locations relative to observing stations and are not a measure of the strength of the substorm auroral onset processes. We discuss possible additional implications on substorm expansion phase development.",

We study the effect of this QTDW-tidal interaction on the ionosphere and thermosphere using the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model. This interaction reduces the amplitude of the migrating diurnal tide in the lower thermosphere by ~10 m/s in neutral winds and also generates sum and difference secondary waves in the lower thermosphere and E region ionosphere. As a result of the changed migrating diurnal tide and sum/difference secondary wave, vertical ion drift varies with local time at different longitudes by ~5 m/s. In addition, the changed migrating diurnal tide also modulates the thermospheric composition (O/N<SUB>2</SUB>). During a QTDW event, the ionosphere F<SUB>2</SUB> region peak electron density (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) is reduced due to the mixing effect of the QTDW dissipation; N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> also shows changes in local time variation due to the QTDW-tidal interaction. The sum and difference secondary waves can cause additional oscillations in vertical ion drift and ionospheric electron densities. The QTDW-tidal interaction is another mechanism by which the QTDW impacts the ionosphere and thermosphere, along with other mechanisms: QTDW modulation of the E region wind dynamo with a period of quasi-2 days and QTDW dissipation induced mixing in the thermosphere.",

         "abstract": "While nightside subauroral proton aurora shows rapid temporal variations, the cause of this variability has rarely been investigated. Using well-coordinated observations by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imagers, THEMIS satellites in the equatorial magnetosphere, and the low-altitude NOAA 17 satellite, we examined the rapid temporal evolution of subauroral proton aurora in the premidnight sector. An isolated proton aurora occurred soon after an auroral poleward boundary intensification that was followed by an auroral streamer reaching the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval. Three THEMIS satellites in the magnetotail detected flow bursts and one of the THEMIS satellites in the outer plasmasphere observed a ring current injection together with electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave intensifications. Proton auroral brightenings occurred multiple times throughout the storm main phase and a majority of those were correlated with auroral streamers reaching the auroral equatorward boundary. This sequence highlights the important role of transient flow bursts and particle injections for plasma transport into the inner magnetosphere and thus reflects a tail-inner magnetospheric interaction process in which transient flow bursts play an important role in injecting ring current ions into the plasmasphere, causing rapid modulation of precipitation and the resultant subauroral proton aurora.",

         "abstract": "It took about 12 h for the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite to fly from the outbound pass to inbound pass of every inner magnetosphere crossing. This provides a unique opportunity to study the nightside-to-dayside evolution of the corotating inner magnetosphere when the outbound pass is in the nighttime while the inbound pass is in the daytime because a flux tube observed on the nightside may be observed again on the dayside in such situation. The differences between the two observations may be caused by the evolution of the flux tube. By analyzing both the passive and active sounding measurements from the IMAGE Radio Plasma Imager, we study two cases concerning this evolution. One, under a quiet geomagnetic condition, shows a typical evolution process during which the plasmapause was observed on both the nightside and the dayside. The other, during the recovery phase of a magnetic storm, shows a different inner magnetospheric structure in which the distinct plasmapause observed on the nightside becomes unidentifiable on the dayside as the density in the nearly empty nightside plasmatrough increases to a level similar to that of the plasmasphere. It is shown that the evolutions of the inner magnetosphere in both cases were primarily controlled by the fast plasma refilling of the flux tubes from the ionosphere as the flux tubes drift from the nightside to the dayside. In the former case the fast refilling was confined inside L = \u223c6.3, while in the latter case the fast refilling extended to at least L = 10. The present observations provide an example for fast refilling as a possible cause of the smooth density transition from the plasmasphere to the subauroral region and demonstrate the importance of the plasmasphere-ionosphere coupling in controlling the structures of the inner magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Field-aligned currents (FACs), also known as Birkeland currents, are the agents by which energy and momentum are transferred to the ionosphere from the magnetosphere and solar wind. This coupling is enhanced at substorm onset through the formation of the substorm current wedge. Using FAC data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment and substorm expansion phase onsets identified using the Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet technique, we examine the Northern Hemisphere FACs in all local time sectors with respect to substorm onset and subdivided by season. Our results show that while there is a strong seasonal dependence on the underlying FACs, the increase in FACs following substorm onset only varies by 10% with season, with substorms increasing the hemispheric FACs by 420 kA on average. Over an hour prior to substorm onset, the dayside currents in the postnoon quadrant increase linearly, whereas the nightside currents show a linear increase starting 20-30 min before onset. After onset, the nightside Region 1, Region 2, and nonlocally closed currents and the SuperMAG AL (SML) index follow the Weimer (1994, https://doi.org/10.1029/93JA02721) model with the same time constants in each season. These results contrast earlier contradictory studies that indicate that substorms are either longer in the summer or decay faster in the summer. Our results imply that, on average, substorm FACs do not change with season but that their relative impact on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system does due to the changes in the underlying currents.",

         "abstract": "Ground-based observations have shown Pi1B magnetic pulsations are associated with substorm onset. These pulsations can also be observed at geosynchronous orbit, suggesting that they propagate from (or beyond) geosynchronous orbit to the ionosphere at substorm onset. Independently, investigations have shown that the initial brightening of an arc at subtorm onset is Alfv\u00e9nic in nature (i.e., that the aurora during the initial brightening is wave-driven). These results raise the question of whether Pi1B pulsations might drive Alfv\u00e9nic aurora at substorm onset. In this paper, data from a single event are presented that show Pi1B pulsations observed simultaneously at geosynchronous orbit, by FAST just above the ionosphere and by various ground stations. The event is observed by FAST within a few minutes of the onset of Pi1B pulsations, with an electron signature of the onset arc that is quite characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic aurora, showing that at least a portion of the initial brightening is wave-driven and associating this with the presence of Pi1B pulsations. The implication of this work is that Pi1B pulsations propagate to the ionosphere from beyond geosynchronous orbit and provide the wave power to drive Alfv\u00e9nic aurora at substorm onset, at least for this single, isolated event. The luminosity associated with the Alfv\u00e9nic aurora, however, may only provide a small contribution to the total brightness.",

         "abstract": "Substorms cause significant disturbances in the ionosphere. However, it has not been well understood how the electric field and electrojet in the dayside equatorial ionosphere respond to substorm onset. Previous studies found that the equatorial electric field, after substorm onset, could be eastward or westward. Because the onset of isolated substorms is often related to a northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), the measured total electric field is determined by contributions from both IMF northward turning and substorm onset and is not necessarily the signature of the onset. In order to exclude the effect of IMF northward turning, we analyze the variations of ionospheric electric field and electrojet during storm time substorms when the IMF remains stable. Thus, the ionospheric variations can be identified to be caused solely by substorms. The electric field data are measured by the Jicamarca radar, and the electrojet is derived from magnetometers at Jicamarca and Piura. It is found that substorm onset induces an eastward electric field and electrojet in the dayside equatorial ionosphere when the IMF remains continuously southward across the onset. The equatorial electrojet starts to increase at the onset, reaches a maximum value \u223c30 min after the onset, and then decreases to the pre-onset value \u223c60 min after the onset. Westward electric field and counter-electrojet occur only if the substorm onset is associated with a northward turning of the IMF. It is concluded that the effect of substorm onset on the dayside equatorial ionosphere, without involvement of IMF reorientations, is an enhanced eastward electric field.",

The most important features that characterize this state include (1) magnetic reconnections can still occur, which take place at the equatorward of the cusp in one hemisphere, the tailward of the cusp in the other hemisphere, and also in the plasma sheet; (2) significant north-south asymmetry exists in both magnetosphere and ionosphere; (3) the polar ionosphere mainly presents a weak two-cell convection pattern, with the polar cap potential valued at \u223c30 kV; (4) the whole magnetosphere-ionosphere system stays in a very quiet state, and the AL index does not exceed -70 nT; and (5) the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can still be excited at both flanks of the magnetosphere.

         "abstract": "Jupiter's thermosphere is \u223c700 K hotter than expected if it were heated only by solar extreme ultraviolet radiation. Other, more effective heat sources are therefore necessary to explain the high observed temperatures \u2265900 K. It has been suggested that heating resulting from the atmospheric interaction with Jupiter's dynamic magnetosphere could account for the excess heat required. However to date, no numerical models have been successful at reproducing Jupiter's hot thermosphere without invoking essentially ad hoc heating mechanisms. Work presented in Yates et al. (2014, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2013.11.009\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2013.11.009</A>) emphasized the importance of incorporating time dependence in magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling when simulating this aspect of the Jovian system. We extend their model (for a single magnetospheric compression or expansion) to simulate the response of thermospheric heating to multiple shocks and rarefactions in the solar wind for the first time. We employ a configurable magnetosphere model coupled to an azimuthally symmetric general circulation model. We compare the response of thermospheric temperatures to these consecutive magnetospheric reconfigurations over a period of 100 Jovian rotations. We find that the thermal structure of our model thermosphere does not respond significantly to such a prolonged period of magnetospheric reconfigurations. Thermospheric mean temperatures increase by a maximum of \u223c15 K throughout our simulation. The high-latitude and high-altitude thermosphere is most influenced by magnetospheric reconfigurations. While this simulation shows that magnetospheric reconfigurations can heat the thermosphere, it also shows the need to consider a more realistic representation of the coupled Jovian system as well as alternate sources of heating not dependent on the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "New mechanisms for imposing planetary wave (PW) variability on the ionosphere-thermosphere system are discovered in numerical experiments conducted with the National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model. First, it is demonstrated that a tidal spectrum modulated at PW periods (3-20 days) entering the ionosphere-thermosphere system near 100 km is responsible for producing \u00b140 m/s and \u00b110-15 K PW period oscillations between 110 and 150 km at low to middle latitudes. The dominant response is broadband and zonally symmetric (i.e., \"S0\") over a range of periods and is attributable to tidal dissipation; essentially, the ionosphere-thermosphere system \"vacillates\" in response to dissipation of the PW-modulated tidal spectrum. In addition, some specific westward propagating PWs such as the quasi-6-day wave are amplified by the presence of the tidal spectrum; the underlying mechanism is hypothesized to be a second-stage nonlinear interaction. The S0 total neutral mass density (\u03c1) response at 325 km consists of PW period fluctuations of order \u00b13-4%, roughly equivalent to the day-to-day variability associated with low-level geomagnetic activity. The variability in \u03c1 over short periods (\u223c&lt; 9 days) correlates with temperature changes, indicating a response of hydrostatic origin. Over longer periods \u03c1 is also controlled by composition and mean molecular mass. While the upper-thermosphere impacts are modest, they do translate to more significant changes in the F region ionosphere.",

In this study, for the first time, we quantitatively investigate the posteclipse response of the global ionosphere and thermosphere system to the recent Great American Solar Eclipse using a high-resolution, global, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics model. It was found that the posteclipse response of the ionosphere and thermosphere is significant and worldwide, which was not expected. Specifically, even 9 hr after the eclipse ended, the globally averaged ionospheric total electron content perturbations were about 0.2 total electron content unit, and the corresponding changes in neutral temperature and winds reached 2 K and 2 m/s. The changes in the global dynamic and energetic processes associated with the solar eclipse contributed to this long-lasting response of the ionosphere and thermosphere during the posteclipse period.",

         "abstract": "A recent statistical study of ULF waves driven by substorm-injected particles observed using Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) found that the phase characteristics of these waves varied depending on where the wave was observed relative to the substorm. Typically, positive azimuthal wave numbers, m, were observed in waves generated to the east of the substorms and negative m to the west. The magnitude of m typically increased with the azimuthal separation between the wave observation and the substorm location. The energies estimated for the driving particles for these 83 wave events were found to be highest when the waves were observed closer to the substorm and lowest farther away. Each of the 83 events studied by James et al. (2013) involved just a single wave observation per substorm. Here a study of three individual substorm events are presented, with associated observations of multiple ULF waves using various different SuperDARN radars. We demonstrate that a single substorm is capable of driving a number of wave events characterized by different azimuthal scale lengths and wave periods, associated with different energies, W, in the driving particle population. We find that similar trends in m and W exist for multiple wave events with a single substorm as was seen in the single wave events of James et al. (2013). The variety of wave periods present on similar L shells in this study may also be evidence for the detection of both poloidal Alfv\u00e9n and drift compressional mode waves driven by substorm-injected particles.",

         "abstract": "Very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals from navigational transmitters propagate worldwide in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide formed by the Earth and the electrically conducting lower ionosphere. Changes in the signal properties are signatures of variations in the conductivity of the reflecting boundary of the lower ionosphere which is located in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and their analysis is, therefore, a way to study processes in these remote regions. Here we present a study on amplitude perturbations of local origin on the VLF transmitter signals (NPM, NLK, NAA, and JJI) observed during tropical cyclone (TC) Evan, 9-16 December 2012 when TC was in the proximity of the transmitter-receiver links. We observed a maximum amplitude perturbation of 5.7 dB on JJI transmitter during 16 December event. From Long Wave Propagation Capability model applied to three selected events we estimate a maximum decrease in the nighttime D region reference height (H') by 5.2 km (13 December, NPM) and maximum increase in the daytime D region H' by 6.1 km and 7.5 km (14 and 16 December, JJI). The results suggest that the TC caused the neutral densities of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere to lift and sink (bringing the lower ionosphere with it), an effect that may be mediated by gravity waves generated by the TC. The perturbations were observed before the storm was classified as a TC, at a time when it was a tropical depression, suggesting the broader conclusion that severe convective storms, in general, perturb the mesosphere and the stratosphere through which the perturbations propagate.",

         "abstract": "The sudden formation of parallel electric fields in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling system is essential to complete substorm onset. From this standpoint, we focus substorm ignition on field-aligned acceleration by studying the dynamical behavior of auroral kilometric radiation. Field-aligned auroral acceleration shows a distinct two-step evolution at substorm onset: the activation of low-altitude acceleration (h \u223c 4000-5000 km) which corresponds to auroral initial brightening and the subsequent abrupt breakout of high-altitude acceleration (h \u223c 6000-12,000 km) which corresponds to auroral breakup. Cases when only low-altitude acceleration (first-step evolution) is activated are pseudosubstorms. This indicates that the second evolution of field-aligned acceleration divides full substorm from pseudosubstorm. The statistical relationship between the plasma flow burst in the plasma sheet and its response to the M-I coupling region shows that about 65% of flow bursts cause pseudobreakup/initial brightening (low-altitude acceleration) and one third of them develops into full substorm (low-altitude and high-altitude accelerations), while the magnitude of flow velocity does not necessarily distinguish between pseudobreakup and full substorm. This suggests that some plasma flow bursts originate field-aligned current which first enhance low-altitude acceleration, and the increasing field-aligned current induces second acceleration above the preexisting low-altitude acceleration as a consequence of current/current-driven instabilities. In this sense, the substorm is finally ignited in the auroral M-I coupling region.",

We present Cluster multispacecraft observations of Poynting fluxes associated with abrupt changes in large-scale electric fields during sudden commencements and southward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The Cluster spacecraft detected Poynting fluxes dominated by the field-aligned upward component during the preliminary impulse of sudden commencements and in the initial period after southward turning of the IMF. The upward Poynting flux indicates existence of Alfv\u00e9n waves transporting electromagnetic energy from the ionosphere toward the magnetosphere leading to magnetospheric convection changes. The waveguide model and global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation calculating evolution of the Poynting flux following solar wind pressure enhancements also show upward Poynting fluxes propagating from the ionosphere toward the magnetosphere faster than the propagation of compressional waves. We conclude that the ionosphere acts as a channel to transmit electromagnetic energy supplied as field-aligned currents toward a wide region in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system instantaneously, leading to changes in magnetospheric convection electric fields.",

         "abstract": "Auroral arcs are often associated with magnetically quiet time and substorm growth phases. We have studied the evolution of auroral structures during global and local magnetic activity to investigate the occurrence rate of auroral arcs during different levels of magnetic activity. The ground-magnetic and auroral conditions are described by the magnetometer and auroral camera data from five Magnetometers \u2014 Ionospheric radars \u2014 All-sky cameras Large Experiment stations in Finnish and Swedish Lapland. We identified substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases from the local electrojet index (IL) in 1996-2007 and analyzed the auroral structures during the different phases. Auroral structures were also analyzed during different global magnetic activity levels, as described by the planetary Kp index. The distribution of auroral structures for all substorm phases and Kp levels is of similar shape. About one third of all detected structures are auroral arcs. This suggests that auroral arcs occur in all conditions as the main element of the aurora. The most arc-dominated substorm phases occur in the premidnight sector, while the least arc-dominated substorm phases take place in the dawn sector. Arc event lifetimes and expectation times calculated for different substorm phases show that the longest arc-dominated periods are found during growth phases, while the longest arc waiting times occur during expansion phases. Most of the arc events end when arcs evolve to more complex structures. This is true for all substorm phases. Based on the number of images of auroral arcs and the durations of substorm phases, we conclude that a randomly selected auroral arc most likely belongs to a substorm expansion phase. A small time delay, of the order of a minute, is observed between the magnetic signature of the substorm onset (i.e., the beginning of the negative bay) and the auroral breakup (i.e., the growth phase arc changing into a dynamic display). The magnetic onset was observed to precede the structural change in the auroral display. A longer delay of a few minutes was found between the beginning of the growth phase and the first detected auroral structure.",

         "abstract": "A planet's magnetosheath extends from downstream of its bow shock up to the magnetopause, where the solar wind flow is deflected around the magnetosphere and the solar wind-embedded magnetic field lines are draped. This makes the region an important site for plasma turbulence, instabilities, reconnection, and plasma depletion layers. A relatively high Alfv\u00e9n Mach number solar wind and a polar-flattened magnetosphere make the magnetosheath of Saturn both physically and geometrically distinct from the Earth's. The polar flattening is predicted to affect the magnetosheath magnetic field structure and thus the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Here we investigate the magnetic field in the magnetosheath with the expectation that polar flattening is manifested in the overall draping pattern. We compare an accumulation of Cassini data between 2004 and 2010 with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and an analytical model representative of a draped field between axisymmetric boundaries. The draping patterns measured are well captured and in broad agreement for given upstream conditions with those of the MHD simulations (which include polar flattening). The deviations from the analytical model, based on no polar flattening, suggest that nonaxisymmetry is invariably a key feature of the magnetosphere's global structure. Our results show a comprehensive overview of the configuration of the magnetic field in a nonaxisymmetric magnetosheath as revealed by Cassini. We anticipate our assessment to provide an insight to this barely studied interface between a high Alfv\u00e9nic bow shock and a dynamic magnetosphere.",

During northward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) Bz conditions, the magnetosphere acts as a closed \"cavity\" and reacts to solar wind DPPs more simply than during southward IMF. In this study we use solar wind data collected by ACE and WIND together with magnetic field observations of Geotail, Cluster, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), Van Allen Probes, GOES missions, and ground magnetometer arrays to observe the magnetosphere (dayside, nightside, inner magnetosphere, magnetotail, magnetosheath, etc.) and ionosphere response simultaneously in several local time sectors and regions. A total of 37 events were selected during the period between February 2007 to December 2017. We examine the global response of each event and identify systematic behavior of the magnetosphere due to DPPs' compression, such as MHD wave propagation, sudden impulses, and Ultra Low Frequency waves (ULF) in the Pc5 range. Our results confirm statistical studies with a more limited coverage that have been performed at different sectors and/or regions of the magnetosphere. We present observations of the different signatures generated in different regions that propagate through the magnetosphere. The signature of the tailward traveling DPP is observed to move at the same solar wind speed, and in superposition of other known magnetospheric perturbations. It is observed that the DPP also generates or increases the amplitude of Pc4 5 waves observed in the inner magnetosphere, while similar waves are observed on the ground.",

         "abstract": "The effects of the leading edge stream interface of high-speed solar-wind streams (HSSs) upon the Earth's magnetosphere have been extensively documented. The arrival of HSSs leads to significant changes in the plasmasphere, plasma sheet, ring current, and radiation belts, during the evolution from slow solar wind to persistent fast solar wind. Studies have also documented effects in the lower ionosphere and the neutral atmosphere. However, only cursory attention has been paid to the trailing-edge stream interface during the transition back from fast solar wind to slow solar wind. Here we report on the statistical changes that occur in the plasmasphere, plasma sheet, ring current, and electron radiation belt during the passage of the trailing-edge stream interface of HSSs, when the magnetosphere is in most respects in an extremely quiescent state. Counterintuitively, the peak flux of 1 MeV electrons is observed to occur at this interface. In contrast, other regions of the magnetosphere demonstrate extremely quiet conditions. As with the leading-edge stream interface, the occurrence of the trailing-edge stream interface has a periodicity of 27 days, and hence, understanding the changes that occur in the magnetosphere during the passage of trailing edges of HSSs can lead to improved forecasting and predictability of the magnetosphere as a system.",

         "abstract": "We studied fundamental properties of spatial-temporal evolution of energetic electrons trapped in the inner magnetosphere (L \u2264 7.4) during an isolated substorm by using a four-dimensional drift kinetic simulation under the time-dependent electric and magnetic fields provided by a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. When the interplanetary magnetic field turns southward, both the potential and induction electric fields start to increase in the inner magnetosphere, resulting in a gradual injection of low-energy electrons (\u226451.9 keV) and deceleration of high-energy electrons (\u2265114 keV). The deceleration of high-energy electrons results in a decrease in the phase space density of the high-energy electrons during the growth phase. After a while, an abrupt transition of phase state (a substorm onset) occurs in the magnetosphere, which triggers abrupt changes in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The AL index decreases rapidly, and magnetic field lines become dipole-like. The dipolarization does not proceed smoothly in the inner magnetosphere because of significant force imbalance between the J \u00d7 B force and the grad P force. As a consequence, the electric field oscillates with a period of 2-3 min, resulting in multiple injections of the low-energy electrons. The low- and high-energy electrons are accelerated under the strong influence of the drift betatron and gyro betatron, so that the acceleration process is essentially nonlinear. Our simulation results suggest that the force-induced processes play an essential role in the substorm-associated redistribution of energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "We investigate the plasma sheet pressure variations in the near-Earth magnetotail (radius distance, R, from 7.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> to 12 R<SUB>E</SUB> and magnetic local time, MLT, from 18:00 to 06:00) during substorm growth phase with Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) observations. It is found that, during the substorm growth phase, about 39.4% (76/193) of the selected events display a phenomenon of equatorial plasma pressure (P<SUB>eq</SUB>) decrease. The occurrence rates of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease cases are higher in the dawn (04:00 to 06:00) and dusk (18:00 to 20:00) flanks (&gt; 50%) than in the midnight region (20:00 to 04:00, &lt; 40%). The mean values of the maximum percentages of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease during the substorm growth phases are larger in the dawn and dusk flanks ( -20%) than in the midnight region ( &gt; -16%). The mean value of P<SUB>eq</SUB> increase percentages at the end of substorm growth phase is the highest ( 40%) in the premidnight MLT bin (22:00 to 00:00) and is almost unchanged in the dawn and dusk flanks. Further investigations show that 13.0% of the events have more than 10% of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease at the end of substorm growth phase comparing to the value before the growth phase, and 28.0% of the events have small changes (&lt; 10%), and 59.0% events have a more than 10% increase. This study also reveals the importance of electron pressure (P<SUB>e</SUB>) in the variation of P<SUB>eq</SUB> in the substorm growth phase. The P<SUB>e</SUB> variations often account for more than 50% of the P<SUB>eq</SUB> changes, and the ratios of P<SUB>e</SUB> to ion pressure often display large variations ( 50%). Among the investigated events, during the growth phase, an enhanced equatorial plasma convection flow is observed, which diverges in the midnight tail region and propagates azimuthally toward the dayside magnetosphere with velocity of 20 km/s. It is proposed that the P<SUB>eq</SUB> decreases in the near-Earth plasma sheet during the substorm growth phase may be due to the transport of closed magnetic flux toward the dayside magnetosphere driven by dayside magnetopause reconnection. Both solar wind and ionospheric conductivity effects may influence the distributions of occurrence rates for P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease events and the P<SUB>eq</SUB> increase percentages in the investigated region.",

The Fourier fitting method was applied to obtain the monthly mean amplitudes of zonal wind, TEC and EEJ. The least squares fitting method was utilized to perform a spectral analysis. Our data indicate that the QBOs of the stratosphere and mesosphere are present in the zonal winds between 20 and 40 km and 82 and 96 km at KB. The QBO is also present in the global TEC at 40\u00b0S to 40\u00b0N latitude and is characterized by the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). We propose that the QBOs in the mesosphere are linked to the QBOs in the ionosphere through the modulation of the E region dynamo by neutral winds and the equatorial ionospheric fountain effect. This model is verified by the QBO signals in the EEJ and diurnal tides in the E region of the ionosphere. The absence of QBO signals in the zonal wind at 250 km confirms that QBO signals in the TEC are not modulated by the zonal wind in the F region ionosphere, which further substantiates the model.",

         "abstract": "During 30 September to 9 October 2016, Hurricane Matthew traversed the Caribbean Sea to the east coast of the United States. During its period of greatest intensity, in the central Caribbean, Matthew excited a large number of concentric gravity waves (GWs or CGWs). In this paper, we report on hurricane-generated CGWs observed in both the stratosphere and mesosphere from spaceborne satellites and in the ionosphere by ground Global Positioning System receivers. We found CGWs with horizontal wavelengths of 200-300 km in the stratosphere (height of 30-40 km) and in the airglow layer of the mesopause (height of 85-90 km), and we found concentric traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs or CTIDs) with horizontal wavelengths of 250-350 km in the ionosphere (height of 100-400 km). The observed TIDs lasted for more than several hours on 1, 2, and 7 October 2016. We also briefly discuss the vertical and horizontal propagation of the Hurricane Matthew-induced GWs and TIDs. This study shows that Hurricane Matthew induced significant dynamical coupling between the troposphere and the entire middle and upper atmosphere via GWs. It is the first comprehensive satellite analysis of gravity wave propagation generated by hurricane event from the troposphere through the stratosphere and mesosphere into the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "The four Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observed energetic (E&gt;50 keV) ion bursts exhibiting an inverse dispersion in the magnetosheath on 28 December 2015. We consider the possibility that these ions originate from the magnetosphere. The ion composition ratios, flux levels, and the spectral slopes of the energetic ion energy spectra observed in the foreshock and in the magnetosheath resemble those in the outer magnetosphere but differ significantly from those seen further upstream from the bow shock at ACE. The particle gyrocenters lie earthward from the spacecraft, indicating that the maximum ion fluxes come from close to the magnetosphere. We provide important evidence that argues against an explanation of the particle source in terms of hot flow anomaly acceleration. A three-dimensional global hybrid simulation shows that escaping magnetospheric ions can be scattered and transported across the magnetosheath. Ground magnetometer observations suggest that a solar wind pressure increase accelerates escaping magnetospheric ions via betatron acceleration, resulting in an inverse energy dispersion in the magnetosheath. However, there are no pressure changes detected on the MMS and ACE spacecraft and the ground magnetic field strength does not appear to be large enough to be consistent with the large magnetospheric compression needed to account for a betatron acceleration. Therefore, we suggest that the inverse energy dispersion event can be explained by a magnetic field rotation that connects MMS to the subsolar magnetosphere, enabling high-energy particles from deep within the inner magnetosphere gain access to the magnetopause and magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "GPS-based ionospheric tomography is a well-known technique for imaging the total electron content (TEC) between GPS satellites and receivers. However, as an integral measurement of electron concentration, TEC typically encompasses both the ionosphere and plasmasphere, masking signatures from the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere due to the dominant ionosphere. Imaging these regions requires a technique that isolates TEC in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere. Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System (MIDAS) employs tomography to image the electron distribution in the ionosphere. Its implementation for regions beyond is yet to be seen due to the different dynamics present above the ionosphere. This paper discusses the extension of MIDAS to image these altitudes using GPS phase-based TEC measurements and follows the work by Spencer and Mitchell (2011). Plasma is constrained to dipole field lines described by Euler potentials, resulting in a distribution symmetrical about the geomagnetic equator. A simulation of an empirical plasmaspheric model by Gallagher et al. (1988) is used to verify the technique by comparing reconstructions of the simulation with the empirical model. The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) is used as GPS receiver locations. The verification is followed by a validation of the modified MIDAS algorithm, where the regions' TEC is reconstructed from COSMIC GPS phase measurements and qualitatively compared with previous studies using Jason-1 and COSMIC data. Results show that MIDAS can successfully image features/trends of the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere observed in other studies, with deviations in absolute TEC attributed to differences in data set properties and the resolution of the images.",

         "abstract": "Medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) are a phenomenon widely and frequently observed over the ionosphere from high to low latitudes. Night time MSTIDs are caused generally by the polarization electric field in the ionosphere. However, propagation of this polarization electric field to the magnetosphere has not yet been identified. Here, we report the first observation of the polarization electric field and associated density variations of a night time MSTID in the magnetosphere. The MSTID event was observed by an all-sky airglow imager at Gakona (geographical latitude: 62.39\u00b0N, geographical longitude: 214.78\u00b0E, magnetic latitude: 63.20\u00b0N), Alaska. The Arase satellite passed over the MSTID in the inner magnetosphere at 0530-0800 UT (2030-2300 LT) on November 3, 2018. This MSTID, observed in 630 nm airglow images, was propagating westward with a horizontal wavelength of \u223c165 km, a north-south phase front, and a phase velocity of \u223c80 m/s. The Arase satellite footprint on the ionosphere crossed the MSTID in the direction nearly perpendicular to the MSTID phase fronts. The electric field and electron density observed by the Arase satellite showed periodic variation associated with the MSTID structure with amplitudes of \u223c2 mV/m and \u223c150 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively. The electric field variations projected to the ionosphere are mainly in the east-west direction and are consistent with the direction of the polarization electric field expected from MSTID growth by E \u00d7 B drift. This observation indicates that the polarization electric field associated with the MSTID in the ionosphere is projected onto the magnetosphere, causing plasma density fluctuations in the magnetosphere.",

The goal of this study is to understand physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of active discrete auroral forms (curls and folds) typically observed during the substorm onset. Our simulations demonstrate that active feedback of the auroral ionosphere on magnetic field-aligned currents carried by ULF Alfv\u00e9n waves can explain wide variety of auroral structures. The main reason for this variety is a susceptibility of the electrodynamics of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system to parameters of the electric field and plasma in the ionosphere and magnetosphere of the Earth. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, different combinations of these parameters lead to different spatial and temporal behavior of the magnetic field-aligned currents producing aurora. One of the main conclusions from our study is that the ionosphere is responsible for the formation of small-scale curls and folds in the discrete aurora and for the intensification of magnetic field-aligned currents, observed during substorms. The results from our 3-D simulations are applied for the explanation of structure of discrete auroral arcs observed during the 29 October 2013 substorm at Fort Yukon, Alaska.",

         "abstract": "From multipoint, in situ observations and imaging, we reveal the injection-powered, Alfv\u00e9nic nature of auroral acceleration during onset and expansion of a substorm. It is shown how Alfv\u00e9nic variations over time dissipate to form large-scale, inverted-V structures characteristic of quasistatic aurora. This characterization is made possible through the fortuitous occurrence of a substorm onset and expansion phase on field lines traversed by Cluster in the high-altitude acceleration region. Substorm onset was preceded by the occurrence of multiple poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) and subsequent development/progression of a streamer toward the growth phase arc indicating that this is of the PBI-/streamer-triggered class of substorms. Onset on Cluster is marked by the injection of hot, dense magnetospheric plasma in a region tied to one of the preexisting PBI current systems. This was accompanied by a surge of Alfv\u00e9nic activity and enhanced inverted-V acceleration, as the PBI current system intensified and striated to dispersive scale Alfv\u00e9n waves. The growth of Alfv\u00e9n wave activity was significant (up to a factor of 300 increase in magnetic field power spectral density at frequencies 20 mHz \u2272f\u2272 few hertz) and coincided with moderate growth (factor 3-5) in the background PBI current. This sequence is indicative of a cascade process whereby small-scale/dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves are generated from large-scale Alfv\u00e9n waves or current destabilization. It also demonstrates that the initial PBIs and their subsequent evolution are an intrinsic part of the global auroral substorm response to injection and accompanying wave energy input from the magnetotail. Alfv\u00e9nic activity persisted poleward of the PBI currents composing a broad Alfv\u00e9n wave-dominated region extending to the polar cap edge. These waves have transverse scales ranging from a few tens of kilometers to below the ion gyroradius and are associated with large electric fields (up to 200 mV/m) and Poynting fluxes (up to 200 mW/m<SUP>2</SUP> mapped at ionospheric altitudes). The fluctuations show mixtures of traveling and/or reflected (including standing) wave signatures, depending on frequency and location. A transition from incoming traveling wave to standing wave signatures is also seen near onset. Depending on location, electron distributions show signatures of Alfv\u00e9n acceleration, inverted-V acceleration, or evidence of both. Poleward expansion of substorm emissions coincided with the poleward expansion of the hot energetic plasma, and the formation of a large-scale inverted-V current system with concurrent attenuation of Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations within the Alfv\u00e9n-dominated region. We suggest that the attenuation is due to a dissipative effect owing to changes in the dispersive properties of these waves via the injection process and/or due to a transient magnetotail source. These findings suggest that in addition to playing active roles in driving substorm aurora, inverted-V and Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration processes are causally linked.",

         "abstract": "This study investigates the role of solar EUV intensity at controlling the location of the Mars magnetotail current sheet and the structure of the lobes. Four simulation results are examined from a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model. The solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions are held constant, and the Mars crustal field sources are omitted from the simulation configuration. This isolates the influence of solar EUV. It is found that solar maximum conditions, regardless of season, result in a Venus-like tail configuration with the current sheet shifted to the -Y (dawnside) direction. Solar minimum conditions result in a flipped tail configuration with the current sheet shifted to the +Y (duskside) direction. The lobes follow this pattern, with the current sheet shifting away from the larger lobe with the higher magnetic field magnitude. The physical process responsible for this solar EUV control of the magnetotail is the magnetization of the dayside ionosphere. During solar maximum, the ionosphere is relatively strong and the draped IMF field lines quickly slip past Mars. At solar minimum, the weaker ionosphere allows the draped IMF to move closer to the planet. These lower altitudes of the closest approach of the field line to Mars greatly hinder the day-to-night flow of magnetic flux. This results in a buildup of magnetic flux in the dawnside lobe as the S-shaped topology on that side of the magnetosheath extends farther downtail. The study demonstrates that the Mars dayside ionosphere exerts significant control over the nightside induced magnetosphere of that planet.&lt;abstract type=\"synopsis\"&gt;&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Plain Language SummaryMars, which does not have a strong magnetic field, has an induced magnetic environment from the draping of the interplanetary magnetic field from the Sun. It folds around Mars, forming two \"lobes\" of magnetic field behind the planet with a current sheet of electrified gas (plasma) behind it. The current sheet is not directly behind the planet but rather shifted toward the dawn or dusk direction. It is shown here that one factor controlling the location of the current sheet is the dayside ionosphere. At solar maximum, the ionosphere is dense, the magnetic field slips easily by the planet, and the current sheet is shifted toward dawn. At solar minimum, the ionosphere is relatively weak, the magnetic field slippage is slowed down, and the current sheet shifts toward dusk.",

All passes were divided into three angular sectors near 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 \u03b8<SUB>E</SUB> angles in order to estimate the role of the interplanetary magnetic field direction in plasma and magnetic properties of dayside Martian magnetosphere. The time interval chosen was from 17 January to 4 February 2016 when MAVEN was crossing the dayside magnetosphere at solar zenith angle 70\u00b0. Magnetosphere as the region with prevailing energetic planetary ions is always found between the magnetosheath and the ionosphere. The analysis of dayside interaction region showed that for each angular sector with different orientation of the solar wind electric field vector E = -1/c V \u00d7 B one can find specific profiles of the magnetosheath, the magnetic barrier (Michel, 1971, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/RG009i002p00427\">https://doi.org/10.1029/RG009i002p00427</A>; Zhang et al., 1991, https://doi.org/10.1029/91JA00088), and the magnetosphere. Magnetic barrier forms in front of the magnetosphere, and relative magnetic field magnitudes in these two domains vary. The average height of the boundary with ionosphere is 530 km, and the average height of the magnetopause is 730 km. We discuss the implications of the observed magnetosphere structure to the planetary ions loss mechanism.",

         "abstract": "Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system drives the brightest, steadiest aurora in our solar system. This emission is the result of an electrical current system, which couples the magnetosphere to the planetary atmosphere in an attempt to enforce the corotation of the middle magnetospheric plasma. Field-aligned currents transfer angular momentum from the atmosphere to the magnetosphere. In the equatorial plane, the field-aligned currents diverge into radially outward currents, which exert a torque on the plasma due to the J \u00d7 B forces. Equatorward ionospheric currents exert an opposite torque on the ionosphere, which interacts with the thermosphere via ion-neutral collisions. The upward field-aligned currents result in auroral electron precipitation, depositing energy into the high-latitude atmosphere. This energy input is a possible candidate for explaining the large thermospheric temperature measured by the Galileo probe at equatorial latitudes; however, previous atmospheric circulation models have shown that the bulk of the energy is transported poleward, rather than equatorward. We present numerical results of Jupiter's coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system including, for the first time, field-aligned potentials. The model is compared with three previously published works. We find that the rotational decoupling of the magnetospheric and thermospheric angular velocities in the presence of field-aligned potentials tempers the thermospheric response to the outward transport of magnetospheric plasma, but this is a secondary effect to variations in the Pedersen conductance.",

         "abstract": "We address the effect of ionospheric outflow and magnetospheric ion composition on the physical processes that control the development of the 5 August 2011 magnetic storm. Simulations with the Space Weather Modeling Framework are used to investigate the global dynamics and energization of ions throughout the magnetosphere during storm time, with a focus on the formation and evolution of the ring current. Simulations involving multifluid (with variable H<SUP>+</SUP>/O<SUP>+</SUP> ratio in the inner magnetosphere) and single-fluid (with constant H<SUP>+</SUP>/O<SUP>+</SUP> ratio in the inner magnetosphere) MHD for the global magnetosphere with inner boundary conditions set either by specifying a constant ion density or by physics-based calculations of the ion fluxes reveal that dynamical changes of the ion composition in the inner magnetosphere alter the total energy density of the magnetosphere, leading to variations in the magnetic field as well as particle drifts throughout the simulated domain. A low oxygen to hydrogen ratio and outflow resulting from a constant ion density boundary produced the most disturbed magnetosphere, leading to a stronger ring current but misses the timing of the storm development. Conversely, including a physics-based solution for the ionospheric outflow to the magnetosphere system leads to a reduction in the cross-polar cap potential (CPCP). The increased presence of oxygen in the inner magnetosphere affects the global magnetospheric structure and dynamics and brings the nightside reconnection point closer to the Earth. The combination of reduced CPCP together with the formation of the reconnection line closer to the Earth yields less adiabatic heating in the magnetotail and reduces the amount of energetic plasma that has access to the inner magnetosphere.",

Runs are performed for solar wind TDs possessing different polarization senses of magnetic field (north-to-south or south-to-north from the leading to trailing side of the incident TD) and initial half-widths. Two-step compression processes are shown in the transmitted TD, including a \u201cshock compression,\u201d as the TD passes through the shock followed by a subsequent \u201cconvective compression\u201d while the TD is moving in the magnetosheath toward the magnetopause. In cases with a relatively thin solar wind TD, 3-D patchy reconnection is initiated in the transmitted TD, forming magnetosheath flux ropes. Differences between these flux ropes and those due to magnetopause reconnection are discussed. Multiple components of ion particles are present in the velocity distribution in the magnetosheath merging, accompanied by ion heating. For cases with a relatively wide initial TD, a dominant single X line appears in the subsolar magnetosheath after the transmitted TD is narrowed through the two-step compression process. Specifically, in the cases with a south-to-north field rotation across an incident thin TD, the magnetosheath flux ropes could re-reconnect with the closed geomagnetic field lines to generate a closed field line region with mixed magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas, which may contribute to the transport of solar wind plasma into the magnetospheric boundary layer.",

         "abstract": "Although the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral ionosphere contains interesting dynamic phenomena that may significantly impact the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system, it has been much less studied than the dusk-to-premidnight sector. We discuss a dynamic phenomenon in the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral oval, eastward fast flows mainly within the expanse of the Region 1 current (its part equatorward of the polar cap). These flows peak and have a steep speed gradient (increase from low to high latitude) near the interface between the Region 1 and Region 2 currents. Because such flows correspond to an electric field that most likely comes from enhanced Region 2 currents and an associated spatial conductivity gradient, their generation mechanism is analogous to that of a subauroral polarization stream. Therefore, we refer to such an eastward flow as a dawnside auroral polarization stream (DAPS). We show several examples of the presence and absence of DAPS under different geomagnetic activity levels. A DAPS' electric field can heat the ionosphere (and thus the thermosphere), change the convection pattern of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and modify the drift path of magnetospheric particles. Because a DAPS' flow peak maps to a major site of magnetic-kinetic energy conversion in the magnetosphere (the transition region between dipole and stretched field), it may be important for the conversion. A DAPS' steep flow gradient is also potentially important; it may lead to instabilities, such as that responsible for auroral Omega bands. Given its potential importance, knowledge of DAPS is fundamental for understanding the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system.",

On the basis of the steady state magnetosphere results, we trace streamlines of FAC from the ionosphere to draw the global geometry of current streamlines in the magnetosphere. Unlike those cases in which the IMF is purely northward or southward, the introduction of the dominant IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> significantly changes the topologies of the current streamlines. Cusp and mantle currents arise, and the symmetry of the FAC across the noon-night meridional plane breaks in the ionosphere. In addition to the self-closed currents in the Northern or Southern hemispheres, three more types of current streamlines connecting the two ionospheres are shown from the simulation results. The first current, including the cusp current, originates from the southern ionosphere and flows into the northern ionosphere. The second current, mainly the mantle current, and the tail current are connected to form a single current system, threading most of the magnetosphere along a spiral-like path and closing through the two lobes in the far magnetotail. The third current flowing out of the southern and into the northern ionosphere connects the two ionospheres by finally closing through the bow shock instead of the magnetopause. Quantitative results are presented and discussed for the four types of current streamlines and indicate that for the dominant IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> conditions the bow shock current should be included among the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.",

(1985). Although the preliminary and main frequency deviations (PFD, MFD) of the SCF have been attributed to the dusk-to-dawn and dawn-to-dusk potential electric fields, there still remain questions if the positive PFD can be caused by the compressional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave and what causes the evening anomaly of the SCF. With the HF Doppler sounder, we show that the dayside ionosphere moves upward toward the Sun during the main impulse (MI) of the SC, when the compressional wave is supposed to push the ionosphere downward. The motion of the ionosphere is shown to be correlated with the equatorial electrojet, matching the potential electric field transmitted with the ionospheric currents from the polar ionosphere. We confirmed that the electric field of the compressional wave is severely suppressed by the conducting ionosphere and reproduced the SC electric fields using the global MHD simulation in which the potential solver is employed. The model calculations well reproduced the preliminary impulse and MI electric fields and their evening anomaly. It is suggested that the electric potential is transmitted from the polar ionosphere to the equator by the zeroth-order transverse magnetic (TM0) mode waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. The near-instantaneous transmission of the electric potential leads to instantaneous global response of the incompressible ionosphere.",

The magnetotail measurements are obtained by using GPS-orbit measurements that magnetically map out into the magnetotail. Four temporal phases of high-speed-stream-driven storms are studied: (1) the pre-storm density decay of the electron-radiation belt, (2) the electron-radiation-belt density dropout near the time of storm onset, (3) the rapid density recovery a few hours after dropout, and (4) the heating of the electron radiation belt during the high-speed-stream-driven geomagnetic activity. In all four phases the behaviors of the outer electron radiation belt and of the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail are the same and simultaneous. The physical explanations for the behavior in phase 1 (decay), phase 2 (dropout), and phase 4 (heating) lie in the dipolar regions of the magnetosphere: hence for those three phases it is concluded that the temporal behavior of the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail mimics the behavior of the outer electron radiation belt. Behavior attributable to physical processes in the dipole is seen in the magnetotail energetic-electron population: this implies that the origin of the energetic-electron population of the magnetotail is \u201cleakage\u201d or \u201coutward evaporation\u201d from the outer electron radiation belt in the dipolar magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Waves in the atmosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere, and oceans are important mechanisms for dissipating and distributing energy throughout the Earth-atmosphere system. Internal waves are extremely important in the atmosphere, and past global studies have looked at the impacts of gravity waves on the thermosphere using gravity wave parameterizations. Here, in contrast, a medium-scale gravity wave is studied in a global thermosphere-ionosphere model, to determine the 3-D characteristics of the wave as it propagated upward through the thermosphere. The model used is a time-dependent, high-resolution, numerical model of the global thermosphere-ionosphere system, which produces global distributions of mass density, temperature, and all three components of the neutral wind at altitudes from 90 to 500 km. The gravity wave horizontal wavelengths that are measured in the thermosphere are hundreds to thousands of kilometers, with periods associated with these waves of about an hour. Therefore, a gravity wave that is physical, present in the thermosphere, and resolvable in the global numerical model was generated for this study; this wave is a 1000 km horizontal wavelength wave with a 3 h period. The gravity wave grows in amplitude, reaches a critical state and then breaks, creating curved wavefronts, and depositing its energy locally. As the gravity wave breaks, depositing its energy, a secondary wave is generated from the original gravity wave, with horizontal wavelengths of 4000 to 5000 km. The secondary wave propagates globally, unlike the original gravity wave, which only propagates in a local area. The original gravity wave had amplitudes for density and temperature of 35% and \u00b1100 K, respectively, while the secondary wave had amplitudes of 5% and \u00b120 K, respectively.",

         "abstract": "This paper discusses the major pathways of electron distribution function formation in the region of diffuse aurora. The diffuse aurora accounts for about of 75% of the auroral energy precipitating into the upper atmosphere, and its origin has been the subject of much discussion. We show that an earthward stream of precipitating electrons initially injected from the Earth<SUP>'</SUP>s plasma sheet via wave-particle interactions degrades in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produces secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These electrons of magnetospheric origin are then reflected back into the magnetosphere along closed dipolar magnetic field lines, leading to a series of reflections and consequent magnetospheric interactions that greatly augment the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km). To date this, systematic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling element has not been included in auroral research models, and, as we demonstrate in this article, has a dramatic effect (200-300%) on the formation of the precipitating fluxes that result in the diffuse aurora. It is shown that wave-particle interaction processes that drive precipitating fluxes in the region of diffuse aurora from the magnetospheric altitudes are only the first step in the formation of electron precipitation at ionospheric altitudes, and they cannot be separated from the atmospheric \"collisional machine\" that redistributes and transfers their energy inside the magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling system.",

(2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024223\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024223</A>) suggested that time domain structures (TDSs) drive pulsating aurora (with additional contributions by kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves (KAWs)) and that chorus waves have negligible effects. In this comment, we point out that electrons scattered by TDS or KAW (dominantly at 0.1-3 keV, &lt;1 s modulation) cannot explain key features of pulsating aurora, which require precipitation above a few keV with a couple of tens of second modulation. Their study did not conduct quantitative evaluations of wave-aurora correlation. The use of short burst mode data ( &lt;10 s) may only cover a single pulse of pulsating aurora and is not suitable for examining connections to pulsating aurora. \"Field-aligned\" electrons do not necessarily represent loss cone population, and their characteristic energy (hundreds of eV) is much lower than typical precipitation over pulsating aurora. By reexamining the events studied by Mozer et al., we quantitatively demonstrate that TDS and KAW are uncorrelated with pulsating aurora and that only chorus waves showed high correlations with pulsating aurora. Occasional simultaneous occurrence of TDS/KAW and pulsating aurora is found to be coincidental, because the correlation over a time scale of minutes is poor. Several auroral features analyzed in that paper are not pulsating aurora but other types of aurora. We also show that the chorus-pulsating aurora correlation can last for 2 h or longer and can be used to highlight dynamic changes in magnetic field mapping. Chorus waves can resonate with electrons above a few keV and are in agreement with pulsating auroral properties.",

The ensemble is generated by perturbing either the high-latitude electric potential or auroral energy flux in the assimilative mapping for ionosphere electrodynamics (AMIE). Simulations with perturbed high-latitude electric potential result in substantial intraensemble variability in the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to the geomagnetic storm, and the ensemble standard deviation for the change in N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> reaches 50-100% of the mean change. Such large intraensemble variability is not seen when perturbing the auroral energy flux. In this case, the effects of the forcing uncertainty are primarily confined to high latitudes. We therefore conclude that the specification of high-latitude electric fields is an important source of uncertainty when modeling the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to a geomagnetic storm. A multiple linear regression analysis of the results indicates that uncertainty in the storm time changes in the equatorial electric fields, neutral winds, and neutral composition can all contribute to the uncertainty in the ionosphere electron density. The results of the present study provide insight into the possible uncertainty in simulations of the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to geomagnetic storms due to imperfect knowledge of the high-latitude forcing.",

         "abstract": "Observations of Saturn's ultraviolet and infrared aurora show structures that, when traced along the planetary magnetic field, map to the inner, middle, and outer magnetosphere. From low to high latitudes the structures seen in the UV are the Enceladus footprint, which maps to an equatorial radius of 4 R<SUB>S</SUB> (Saturn radii); a diffuse emission that maps to a broad equatorial region from 4-11 R<SUB>S</SUB> on the nightside; and a bright ring of emission that maps to \u223c15 R<SUB>S</SUB>. With the exception of the Enceladus spot, the magnetospheric drivers for these auroral emissions are not yet fully understood. We apply a 1D spatial, 2D velocity space Vlasov solver to flux tubes mapping from equatorial radii of 4, 6, 9, and 13 R<SUB>S</SUB> to Saturn's southern atmosphere. The aim is to globally characterize the field-aligned potential structure and plasma density profiles. The ionospheric properties - the field-aligned current densities at the ionospheric boundary, energy intensity profiles and fluxes of the electrons precipitating into the ionosphere - are also determined. We then couple our results to an ionospheric model to calculate the Pedersen conductances at the foot of the relevant flux tubes. We find that for a zero net potential drop between the ionosphere and magnetosphere, there exists a sharp potential drop at \u223c1.5 R<SUB>S</SUB> along the magnetic field line as measured from the planetary center. The strength of this potential drop is approximately equal to that of the ambipolar potential resulting from the centrifugal confinement of the heavy, cold magnetospheric ion population. We also find that the ionospheric properties respond to changes in the magnetospheric plasma population, which are reflected in the nature of the precipitating electron population. For the flux tube mapping to 9 R<SUB>S</SUB> (-70\u00b0), the incident electron energy flux into the ionosphere resulting from a magnetospheric plasma population with a small fraction of hot electrons is an order of magnitude less than that inferred from observations, implying that significant high-latitude field-aligned potentials (up to 1.5 keV) may exist in the saturnian magnetosphere. Calculated ionospheric Pedersen conductances range from 3.0-18.9 mho, and are thus not expected to limit the currents flowing between the ionosphere and magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "During geomagnetic substorms, around 10<SUP>15</SUP> J of energy is extracted from the solar wind and processed by the Earth's magnetosphere. Prior to the onset of substorm expansion phases, this energy is thought to be largely stored as an increase in the magnetic field in the magnetotail lobes. However, how, when, and where this energy is stored and released within the magnetotail is unclear. Using data from the Cluster spacecraft and substorm onsets from Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet (SOPHIE), we examine the variation in the lobe magnetic energy density with respect to substorm onset for 541 isolated onsets. Based on a cross-correlation analysis and a simple model, we deduce the following: On average, the magnetic energy density increases approximately linearly in the hour preceding onset and decreases at a similar rate after onset. The timing and magnitude of these changes varies with downtail distance, with observations from the mid-tail (X\u223c-9 R<SUB>E</SUB>) showing larger changes in the magnetic energy density that occur \u223c20 min after changes in the near-tail (X\u223c-9 R<SUB>E</SUB>). The decrease in energy density in the near-tail region is observed before the ground onset identified by SOPHIE, implying that the substorm is driven from the magnetotail and propagates into the ionosphere. The implication of these results is that energy in the near-tail region is released first during the substorm expansion phase, with energy conversion propagating away from the Earth with time.",

The OSSEs are performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results from the OSSEs demonstrate that the assimilation of ionosphere observations improves the short-term (1 hr) forecasts and analyses. The OSSEs show that the short-term forecasts and analyses are further improved when the ionosphere observations adjust the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature in addition to the ionosphere electron density. Based on an initialized forecast experiment, we find that adjusting the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature also leads to improved forecast skill in the ionosphere on longer time scales (i.e., beyond 1 hr). Additionally, it is shown that using a 1 hr data assimilation cycle, and removal of second-order divergence damping in WACCMX+DART significantly improves tidal amplitudes, which were previously found to be too small. These initial results represent the first whole atmosphere data assimilation system with capabilities to assimilate observations from the troposphere to the ionosphere-thermosphere.",

         "abstract": "High-speed jets (HSJs) occur frequently in Earth's magnetosheath downstream of the quasiparallel bow shock. They have great impacts on the magnetosheath and the magnetosphere. Using two-dimensional global hybrid simulations, we investigate the formation and evolution of HSJs with different solar wind conditions. When the quasi-parallel shock is formed, HSJs begin to appear in the quasi-parallel magnetosheath. Some elongated HSJs formed at the quasi-parallel bow shock extend toward the quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath along with the background magnetosheath flow. As the elongated HSJs moves in the magnetosheath, filamentary structures of the velocity, ion density, and temperature occur in the magnetosheath. The filamentary structures are the traces of HSJs moving in the magnetosheath. Moreover, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can be excited at HSJs, which causes meandering of HSJs. When the interplanetary magnetic field is aligned to the solar wind velocity, the large-scale HSJs with a parallel (perpendicular) scale size of about 2.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> (0.3 R<SUB>E</SUB>) are formed at the magnetosheath where the \u03b8<SUB>Bn</SUB> is approaching zero. Then, some HSJs converge, leading to the formation of even larger HSJs with a parallel (perpendicular) scale size of 5 R<SUB>E</SUB> (0.6 R<SUB>E</SUB>).",

         "abstract": "The substorm onset process was studied on the basis of the vertical evolution of auroral acceleration regions derived from auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) spectra and Pi pulsations on the ground. The field-aligned auroral acceleration at substorm onset demonstrated two distinct phases. Low-altitude acceleration (h~3000-5000 km), which accompanied auroral initial brightening, prebreakup Pi2, and direct current of ultralow frequency (DC-ULF) pulsation were first activated and played an important role (precondition) in the subsequent substorm expansion phase onset. Prebreakup Pi2 is suggestive of the ballooning mode wave generation, and negative decrease in DC-ULF suggests increasing field-aligned current (FAC). We called this stage the substorm initial phase. A few minutes after this initial phase onset, high-altitude acceleration, which accompanied auroral breakup and poleward expansion with breakup Pi1 and Pi2 pulsations, suddenly broke out in an altitude range from 8000 to 16,000 km. Thus, substorm expansion onset originated in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling region, i.e., substorm ignition in the M-I coupling region. Statistical investigations revealed that about 65% of earthward flow bursts observed in the plasma sheet were accompanied by enhanced low-altitude AKR, suggesting that flow braking of bursts causes FAC and resulting low-altitude field-aligned acceleration in the M-I coupling region. On the basis of these observations, we propose a substorm onset scenario in which FAC that originated from the braking of plasma flow bursts first enhances low-altitude acceleration (substorm initial phase onset) and then the increasing FAC induces current-driven instability in the M-I coupling region, which leads to high-altitude acceleration and resulting substorm expansion phase onset.",

         "abstract": "We have studied successive substorm expansions that occurred in spite of a period of prolonged northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). After the northward IMF persisted for almost \u223c19 h, a series of 11 very weak to moderate substorm expansions occurred during the following 6-h interval of northward IMF on 19 January 1998, separated from each other by a few tens of minutes. Most of these substorm expansions did not accompany significant changes of the solar wind and the IMF. As for typical substorms that occur under southward IMF conditions, spacecraft and ground-based instruments observed auroral breakups and enhancements of the westward auroral electrojet and large-scale convection in the ionosphere, together with plasmoids and dipolarizations in the magnetotail, in association with the substorm expansion onsets. These signatures suggest that the mechanism of substorm expansion onsets is the same as for typical substorms, even under prolonged northward IMF conditions. We suggest that the large IMF \u2223B<SUB>y</SUB>\u2223 affects large-scale convection and energy accumulation in the magnetotail and that the enhanced convection due to the large IMF \u2223B<SUB>y</SUB>\u2223 effect and substorm expansions can be an important factor for the promotion of succeeding substorm expansion onsets.",

         "abstract": "Throat aurora is defined as south-north aligned auroral arcs equatorward of the dayside cusp aurora and was suggested to be the results of cold magnetospheric plasma interaction with magnetopause reconnection, but its observational properties have not yet been well established. In this paper we carefully examine a sequence of throat auroras observed over Svalbard on 27 December 2003. Observations from 630.0 nm [OI] show that poleward moving throat auroras frequently show brightening followed by dimming in auroral intensity, and sometimes, the brightening throat aurora is a precursor of poleward moving auroral forms. Simultaneous all-sky images and HF radar backscatter observations along geomagnetic meridian show that the throat aurora brightening is drifting with ionospheric E \u00d7 B convection and is colocated with enhanced spectral width poleward of the convection reversal boundary (CRB), while its dimming tends to be in the vicinity of the CRB. This leads us to propose that the throat aurora brightening and dimming may be on the open and closed field lines, respectively. Particle data from NOAA 16 confirm that the dimming throat aurora is associated with precipitation of magnetosheath-like particles mixed with magnetospheric ions (&gt;30 keV), which is characteristic of the low-latitude boundary layer. For particle data from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F16, we notice that the dimming throat aurora is associated with lower fluxes of magnetosheath-like electrons accompanied with magnetospheric electrons, which is most likely on closed field lines. The dynamic properties of throat aurora presented in this paper are thus important to understand its generation mechanisms.",

         "abstract": "It has been debated for many years whether all substorm onsets are triggered by a sudden change in the solar wind. Because there is not a generally accepted definition of external triggers, a solar wind change may be identified to be an external trigger by some investigators but not a trigger by others. In this paper, we study the substorm onset from the magnetospheric state during sawtooth events. We do not try to determine whether a solar wind change around the onset is a trigger. Instead, we examine whether an external trigger from the solar wind is always necessary for substorm onset and why large changes in the solar wind do not always trigger sawtooth (substorm) onset. We have analyzed 54 sawtooth onsets and corresponding changes in the solar wind. The mean value of the total magnetic flux in the magnetotail at the sawtooth onsets is 0.98 GWb. Sawtooth onset can occur when the changes in the solar wind are very small (0.5 nPa in the solar wind dynamic pressure and 1 nT in the IMF B<SUB>z</SUB>). We have also identified a number of large changes in the solar wind without occurrence of sawtooth onset, and the mean value of the magnetotail magnetic flux is 0.74-0.79 GWb. However, the large changes in the solar wind do not cause sawtooth onset when the magnetotail magnetic flux is generally smaller than 0.8 GWb in these cases. The observations suggest that sawtooth onset will occur when the magnetotail magnetic flux is close to a critical value (\u223c1 GWb, depending on the solar wind and geomagnetic activity), no matter whether the corresponding change in the solar wind is large or small. The observations also suggest that no sawtooth (substorm) onset can be triggered by a solar wind change if the magnetotail magnetic flux is \u223c25% lower than the critical value of the onset, no matter how large the change in the solar wind is. Sawtooth onset appears to be an internal magnetospheric instability process, and a large change in the solar wind is not necessary for the occurrence of sawtooth onset.",

During the simulation Titan crosses Saturn's magnetopause twice, exiting and reentering Saturn's magnetosphere. The magnetic field in Saturn's magnetosheath is predominately northward. Once inside Saturn's magnetosheath, Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetosphere is removed by slow ionospheric convection. Evidence for reconnection at Titan is not seen. Inside the magnetosheath the plasma flow is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, and magnetic field lines do not strongly drape around Titan. Titan's ionosphere is extended in the magnetosheath because Titan's ionospheric plasma is not stripped away by convecting magnetic field at high altitudes. After Titan crosses back into Saturn's magnetosphere, the magnetospheric plasma and field removes Titan's extended ionosphere, and Titan's induced magnetosphere returns to a \u201ctypical\u201d configuration. The simulation is used to determine the time scale of Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetic field lines or magnetosheath magnetic field lines after a magnetopause crossing. In the magnetosheath, slow (\u223c3 km/s) ionospheric convection removes Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetosphere in \u223c1.8 h. After Titan crosses back into Saturn's rapidly rotating magnetosphere, Titan's connection to magnetosheath magnetic field lines is removed through ionospheric convection in \u223c50 min. The results of the simulation are also compared to data from Cassini's T32 flyby.",

The three cases show discrete stable arcs, substorm aurora, and Alfv\u00e9nic aurora. The field-aligned current structure associated with each type of aurora is shown to agree with contemporary auroral models. Inverted-V type aurora with electron energy peaks of 1-10 keV are observed, and are associated with upward current regions and discrete auroral arcs seen in the all sky imagers. Downward currents are also identified and correlated with regions without visible aurora, and Alfv\u00e9nic electron precipitation is associated with mixed current regions and dynamic aurora evident in the all sky images. The substorm aurora observed also shows upward current regions and inverted-V's associated with bright spots in the ground-based images. The images shown in association with the substorm aurora correlate well with existing substorm models, including that of Akasofu [1964]. In this study we present these new ground and satellite conjunctions and use them to confirm existing theories of auroral acceleration mechanisms. Additionally, we compare the observations to existing substorm models and investigate differences between specific substorms and the various auroral forms associated with them.",

The open flux can be calculated from the area of the polar cap, delineated by the open-closed field line boundary (OCB). This study presents a superposed epoch analysis of the location of the OCB and the change in the magnetic flux content in individual nightside MLT sectors during substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases. Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the IMAGE satellite are used to derive a proxy of the OCB location. In the hour prior to substorm onset, the total nightside flux content increases by up to 0.12 GWb on average, resulting in an equatorward expansion of the OCB. Following substorm onset, the OCB contracts toward the pole as the open magnetic flux content decreases by up to 0.14 GWb on average, but the rate of decrease of the total nightside open flux content differs by 5-66% between the three IMAGE far ultraviolet instruments. The OCB does not contract poleward uniformly in all nightside magnetic local time (MLT) sectors after substorm onset. Close to the substorm onset MLT sector, the OCB contracts immediately following substorm onset; however, the OCB in more dawnward and duskward MLT sectors continues to expand equatorward for up to 120 minutes after substorm onset. Despite the continued increase in flux in these sectors after substorm onset, the total nightside flux content decreases immediately at substorm onset, indicating that the nightside reconnection rate exceeds the dayside rate following substorm onset.",

         "abstract": "The dynamics of the inner magnetosphere is strongly governed by the interactions between different plasma populations that are coupled through large-scale electric and magnetic fields, currents, and wave-particle interactions. Inner magnetospheric plasma undergoes self-consistent interactions with global electric and magnetic fields. Waves excited in the inner magnetosphere from unstable particle distributions can provide energy exchange between different particle populations in the inner magnetosphere and affect the ring current and radiation belt dynamics. The ionosphere serves as an energy sink and feeds the magnetosphere back through the cold plasma outflow. The precipitating inner magnetospheric particles influence the ionosphere and upper atmospheric chemistry and affect climate. Satellite measurements and theoretical studies have advanced our understanding of the dynamics of various plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere. However, our knowledge of the coupling processes among the plasmasphere, ring current, radiation belts, global magnetic and electric fields, and plasma waves generated within these systems is still incomplete. This special issue incorporates extended papers presented at the Inner Magnetosphere Coupling III conference held 23-27 March 2015 in Los Angeles, California, USA, and includes modeling and observational contributions addressing interactions within different plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere (plasmasphere, ring current, and radiation belts), coupling between fields and plasma populations, as well as effects of the inner magnetosphere on the ionosphere and atmosphere.",

         "abstract": "About 40 years after the discovery of the substorm, auroral observations were used to propose that substorm onset was triggered in the inner plasmas sheet (equatorward portion of the auroral oval) by an intrusion of the low entropy plasma by plasma sheet flow channels. Longitudinal localization makes such flow channels difficult to observe with sparse spacecraft, but they can be seen in the ionosphere via the broader, two dimensional coverage by ground based radars. We have analyzed all eight substorm auroral onset events with appropriate auroral and Poker Flat radar viewing during a radar campaign. These, together with five previously analyzed events provide evidence that intruding flow channels play an important role in substorm onsets. That the flux tube integrated entropy of this new plasma must be lower than that of the surrounding plasma implies that the change in the entropy distribution within the plasma sheet gives rises to the substorm onset instability that is seen via the growing auroral and electromagnetic waves seen with substorm auroral onset. Our analysis also adds to previous evidence that the flow channels leading to onset move into the plasma sheet/auroral oval from the open polar cap region of the magnetotail lobes/polar caps, that these flow channels move across the polar cap following their origin near the dayside boundary of the polar cap, and that substantial ground magnetic depressions associated with substorm do not occur with substorm onset but instead occur a few to several minutes later in association with expansion phase streamers.",

On the other hand, there is a broad range of observations, including magnetometers, aurora imagers, and radars, in the ionosphere. Since the nightside ionosphere resembles the magnetotail plasma sheet dynamics projection, it can be used to monitor the tail's dynamics. A proper interpretation of the ionosphere and ground observations necessitates understanding the coupling processes between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. Here, we use the global magnetohydrodynamic simulation model, OpenGGCM-CTIM-RCM, to investigate these coupling processes during periods when the magnetic flux is transported through the tail via narrow fast flow channels, typically called bursty bulk flows (BBFs). We consider three relevant states of the magnetotail: immediately before the substorm's onset, during the expansion of the substorm, and during a steady magnetic convection (SMC) event. The number of flow channels increases, and they penetrate closer to the Earth during SMC. The IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> direction influences fast flows' location but not their orientation in the plasma sheet during this event. However, the dimension of fast flows and streamers do not depend on the IMF conditions and state of the magnetosphere.",

In order to understand the large-scale dynamic processes in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system due to the compression from the solar wind, the 17 March 2015 sudden commencement was studied in detail using global numerical models. This storm was one of the most geoeffective events of the solar cycle 24 with a minimum Dst of -222 nT. The Wind spacecraft recorded a 10-nPa increment in the solar wind dynamic pressure, while the interplanetary magnetic field B<SUB>Z</SUB> became further northward. The University of Michigan Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme global magnetohydrodynamic code was utilized to study the generation and propagation of perturbations associated with the compression of the magnetosphere system. In addition, the high-resolution electric potential and auroral power output from the magnetohydrodynamic model was used to drive the global ionosphere-thermosphere model to investigate the ionosphere-thermosphere system response to pressure enhancement. During the compression, the electric potentials and convection patterns in the polar ionosphere were significantly altered when the preliminary impulse and main impulse field-aligned currents moved from dayside to nightside. As a result of enhanced frictional heating, plasma and neutral temperatures increased at the locations where the flow speeds were enhanced, whereas the electron density dropped at these locations. In particular, the region between the preliminary impulse and main impulse field-aligned currents experienced the most significant heating with 1000-K ion temperature increase and 20-K neutral temperature increase within 2 min. Comparison of the simulation results with the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar observations showed reasonable agreements despite underestimated magnitudes.",

Since the Venus magnetotail is formed due to the solar wind interaction with the ionosphere and the ionosphere is modulated by the solar activity, it is interesting to study the solar cycle dependence of the induced magnetosphere. Here we statistically examine the Venus Express magnetotail data during solar maximum. We find that the magnetic field configuration asymmetry in Venus magnetotail is very much similar to that during solar minimum. The hemispheric asymmetry in the magnetotail persists through the whole solar cycle and magnetic reconnection in the near-Venusian magnetotail might occur during solar minimum as well as solar maximum conditions.",

         "abstract": "Morphological behavior of black aurora as it relates to pulsating aurora is investigated by examining a collection of ground-based observations from January 2007 in support of the Rocket Observations of Pulsating Aurora rocket campaign. Images were sampled from video recorded by a Xybion intensified camera (30 fps) at Poker Flat Research Range, AK. The primary observations of black aurora recorded during the substorm recovery phase were between separate patches of pulsating aurora as well as pulsating aurora separated from diffuse aurora. In these observations the black aurora forms an apparent firm boundary between the auroral forms in a new behavior that is in contrast with previously reported observations. Also presented for the first time are black curls in conjunction with pulsating aurora. Curl structures that indicate shear plasma flows in the ionosphere may be used as a proxy for converging/diverging electric fields in and above the ionosphere. This new subset of black auroral behavior may provide visual evidence of black aurora as an ionospheric feedback mechanism as related to pulsating aurora.",

         "abstract": "During space weather events, a large amount of energy and momentum from the solar wind inputs into the ionosphere-thermosphere. A critical question is that if the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction drives only the open field region in the polar caps, how the solar wind energy and momentum are transmitted to the low latitude and equatorial ionosphere. This important issue has been studied over decades and is still poorly understood, impeding space weather forecasting ability. Here we use our newly developed 2.5-D ionosphere-thermosphere simulation model that self-consistently solves the density, velocity, and temperature for electrons, multiple ion and neutral species, and electromagnetic fields to study this challenging problem. The focus of the present study is on the prompt response of the ionosphere to a convection disturbance from the polar magnetosphere. The longer time scale responses caused by the neutral winds from the polar caps will be the topic of future studies. We show that the momentum is transferred from polar to equatorial ionosphere predominately by fast magnetosonic waves, and propagation of perturbations from the source region experiences delay, damping, and substantial reflection, and the ionosphere/thermosphere behaves like a low-band-pass filter. The finding from this study sheds new insight onto coupling processes within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

         "abstract": "Traditionally, the ionosphere determination just uses American Global Positioning System and Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System dual-frequency data and has a low precision particularly on oceans. With the rapid development of Chinese BeiDou and European Galileo systems, they are playing an increasingly important role for modeling global ionosphere. Meanwhile, satellite altimetry provides valuable and precise ionosphere delay over the oceans. Through introducing priori ionosphere values from an advanced empirical ionosphere model, combining the advantages of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and satellite altimetry technologies, the precision of global ionosphere estimation can be further improved. To assess the improvement, we collect satellite altimetry data from Jason-2/3 and more than 300 global GNSS stations, the data are processed in 2014 and 2018 when the Sun is in a high and a low activity conditions. The results suggest that the ionosphere determination based on multitechnique fusion in a solar-geomagnetic reference frame is well suitable to represent the ionosphere and its structure. The determined ionosphere achieves a better global consistency, and its formal accuracy is significantly reduced. By comparing with the International GNSS Service products, evaluating by satellite altimetry measurements, and independently validating with ionosonde techniques, it is proved that the ionosphere results are further improved through employing additional available data, especially for the ionosphere over the oceans.",

         "abstract": "Several studies have shown that the surroundings of the highest Andes mountains at midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere exhibit gravity waves (GWs) generated by diverse sources which may traverse the troposphere and then penetrate the upper layers if conditions are favorable. There is a specific latitude band where that mountain range is nearly perfectly aligned with the north-south direction, which favors the generation of wavefronts parallel to this orientation. This fact may allow an optimization of procedures to identify topographic GW in some of the observations. We analyze data per season to the east and west of these Andes latitudes to find possible significant differences in GW activity between both sectors. GW effects generated by topography and convection are expected essentially on the eastern side. We use satellite data from two different limb sounding methods: the Global Positioning System radio occultation (RO) technique and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument, which are complementary with respect to the height intervals, in order to study the effects of GW from the stratosphere to the ionosphere. Activity becomes quantified by the GW average potential energy in the stratosphere and mesosphere and by the electron density variance content in the ionosphere. Consistent larger GW activity on the eastern sector is observed from the stratosphere to the ionosphere (night values). However, this fact remains statistically significant at the 90% significance level only during winter, when GWs generated by topography dominate the eastern sector. On the contrary, it is usually assumed that orographic GWs have nearly zero horizontal phase speed and will therefore probably be filtered at some height in the neutral atmosphere. However, this scheme relies on the assumption that the wind is uniform and constant. Our results also suggest that it is advisable to separate night and day cases to study GWs in the ionosphere, as it is more difficult to find significant statistical differences during daytime. This may happen because perturbations induced by GWs during daytime are more likely to occur in a disturbed environment that may hinder the identification of the waves.",

Pitch angle diffusion caused by waves in the inner magnetosphere is the primary source term for the diffuse aurora, especially during storm time. The magnetic local time (MLT) and storm-dependent electrodynamic impacts of the diffuse aurora were analyzed using a comparison between a new self-consistent version of the Hot Electron Ion Drift Integrator with varying electron scattering rates and real geomagnetic storm events. The results were compared with Dst and hemispheric power indices, as well as auroral electron flux and cross-track plasma velocity observations. It was found that changing the maximum lifetime of electrons in the ring current by 2-6 h can alter electric fields in the nightside ionosphere by up to 26%. The lifetime also strongly influenced the location of the aurora, but the model generally produced aurora equatorward of observations.",

We discuss the location of the MR2 region (is it near, middle, and/or distant tail?) and the EO2 trigger mechanism. The upward substorm current wedge field-aligned current (FAC) and the downward FAC in the polar cap dusk sector that were both produced by different types of magnetosphere-ionosphere feedback instability are found to provide the main contribution to the system of FACs during EO1 and EO2. Also, we obtain the estimates for the EO1 and EO2 power and energy. Addressed are the variations in the tail lobe magnetic flux and their (variations) association with EO2. In addition, we describe a 3-D system of mesoscale cells, each of which involves a plasma vortex and a local FAC maximum. The cells of this system in the inner magnetosphere and in the tail lobes intensify one after other within 2 min interval. At last, we substantiate the assumption that the fast plasma flow recorded by the Cluster satellites 7 min prior to EO1 was a bursty bulk flow from the most distant tail.",

         "abstract": "East-west anisotropies in GOES solar energetic particle (SEP) flux observations provide evidence of a time-varying radial gradient between L \u2248 4 and L \u2248 7. During elevated auroral activity, the gradient, represented by the ratio of inner (eastward-observed) to outer (westward-observed) fluxes, exhibits undulations lasting 1-3 h. A superposed epoch analysis based on 85 geosynchronous field dipolarizations observed during 19 SEP events between 1998 and 2006 shows that &gt;4 MeV inner proton fluxes increase as the geosynchronous field stretches during substorm growth phase, then decrease gradually following field dipolarization at substorm onset. This behavior is distinct from the sharp increase of outer belt electrons and protons at the time of the dipolarization. The undulations indicate that substorm-related field changes in the near-Earth magnetotail enhance access of SEPs to the inner magnetosphere (down to L \u2248 4). The observation of undulations at geosynchronous orbit is suppressed during high solar wind dynamic pressure (P<SUB>dyn</SUB> &gt; 5 nPa) or strong geomagnetic storm conditions (Dst\u2217 &lt; -100 nT) because the radial gradient is greatly reduced under these conditions and the interplanetary flux level provides an upper limit to the SEP fluxes in the magnetosphere. A sequence of 10 SEP undulations was observed during and following the 18 April 2002 sawtooth event. Analysis of this sequence shows that undulations observed at all local times are associated with substorm-related field changes on the nightside. GOES eastward SEP observations at all local times can thus serve as global trace particle sensing of substorm-related field reconfigurations in the near-Earth magnetotail.",

Previously, two source regions of the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions have been proposed. The first one is the dayside polar region. Ions from the dayside polar region are transported to the lobe; then they are injected to the nightside plasma sheet during substorm expansion phase. The second one is the nightside aurora region. After the substorm onset, energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are extracted from the ionosphere with the auroral acceleration processes, and the O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are directly supplied to the nightside plasma sheet. We investigated the relative importance of these two regions on supplying the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions in the inner magnetosphere. We performed a test particle simulation in global MHD electromagnetic fields. We obtained the following results. (1) During the substorm growth phase, O<SUP>+</SUP> ions at tens of eV are extracted from the dayside polar region, resulting in the enhancement of the warm O<SUP>+</SUP> ions (hundreds of eV) in the lobe. After the substorm onset, the warm O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are nonadiabatically accelerated to tens of keV and injected to the inner magnetosphere. These O<SUP>+</SUP> ions contribute to most of the O<SUP>+</SUP> ring current. (2) O<SUP>+</SUP> ions at &lt; a few keVs are supplied from the nightside aurora region to the plasma sheet. However, their contribution to the O<SUP>+</SUP> ring current remains small. From the results, we concluded that the main source of the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions is the dayside polar region.",

         "abstract": "Bursty enhancements of hot electrons (\u22730.5 keV) with duration of minutes sometimes occur in the tail magnetosheath. In this study we used the unique simultaneous measurements from the two Acceleration Reconnection Turbulence and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun probes to investigate the likely sources, spatial structures, and responsible processes for these hot electron enhancements. The enhancements can be seen at any distance across the magnetosheath, but those closer to the magnetopause are more often accompanied by magnetosheath density and flow magnitudes changing to more magnetosphere-like values. From simultaneous measurements with the two probes being on either side of magnetopause or both in the magnetosheath, it is evident that these hot electrons come from the magnetosphere near the current sheet without further energization and that the enhancements are a result of bursty lateral magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath, the enhancements and changes in the magnetosheath properties becoming smaller with increasing outward distance from the intrusion. From limited events having specific separation distances and alignments between the probes, we estimated that a single isolated enhancement can have a thin and elongated structure as narrow as 2 R<SUB>E</SUB> wide in the X direction, as long as over 7 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the Y direction, and as thin as 1 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the Z direction. We propose that Kelvin-Helmholtz perturbations at the magnetopause and subsequent magnetosphere-magnetosheath particle mixing due to reconnection or diffusion can plausibly play an important role in generating the bursty magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath and the hot electron enhancements.",

         "abstract": "this paper, a three-dimensional (3-D) global hybrid simulation code and a 3-D geocoronal hydrogen model are used to systematically study the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions at 30.4 nm produced by solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) in the Earth's magnetosheath, associated with different solar wind-interplanetary magnetic field (SW-IMF) conditions and different imaging perspectives. We have found that the EUV emission intensities in the magnetosheath are highly variable from several mR to ~1200 mR and increase with the flow speed, the density, the temperature, and the He<SUP>2+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> density ratio of the solar wind; the northward IMF leads to a minimum emission in the magnetosheath, whereas the southward IMF generates a maximum emission; with the increase of the magnitude of IMF, the emission pattern in the nightside splits from single field-aligned shape into a butterfly shape around the magnetic equator; and the EUV emissions vary with the imaging positions, reflecting different latitudinal and longitudinal information of the magnetosheath. It is noted that the SWCX EUV emissions in the magnetosheath for highly disturbed solar wind conditions should be considered in processing the Moon-based plasmaspheric EUV images. We suggest that EUV imaging of the global magnetosheath requires an EUV imager with large field-of-view, high-sensitivity, large dynamic range, and low intrinsic dark count rate. This investigation could provide us with an overall understanding on SWCX EUV emissions in the magnetosheath which can potentially be used to image the global magnetosheath to study the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling in the future.",

         "abstract": "The response of high-energy particle precipitation to substorm onset is investigated using observations of cosmic noise absorption by a 7 \u00d7 7 beam imaging riometer in Kilpisj\u00e4rvi, Finland, and substorm onset information obtained from the IMAGE satellite. A new method is developed for automatic detection of absorption responses to substorm onsets. Superposed epoch analysis shows that absorption exhibits some fading prior to and a clear response preceding substorm onset. These features are interpreted as being due to the stretching of magnetic field lines and a rapid dipolarization during the late growth phase of a substorm. A distinct dependence on substorm onset location is discovered with response delay increasing with distance from substorm onset and all responses to closest substorms (within 250 km) preceding substorm onset by 1-5 min. The absorption propagation is further examined using the average velocity from the onset to the riometer location as well as instantaneous velocities for a short period of time when substorm-enhanced absorption reaches the field of view. Comparison of the two velocity estimates shows that the absorption propagation is slower and oriented in more poleward directions away from substorm onset, with some evidence of near instantaneous expansion in zonal directions over large distances of \u223c2000 km from onset followed by a slower expansion primarily in poleward and westward directions. The observations suggest that during substorms precipitating electrons in the high-energy part of the spectrum behave differently from their low-energy counterparts and that they exhibit some evidence of predictable behavior.",

         "abstract": "Broadband electrons (BBEs) exhibit remarkable electron flux enhancements over a broad energy range (0.03-30 keV) near the equatorward edge of the auroral oval during geomagnetic storms. Here, we report a BBE event observed by the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) satellite at 1355-1359 UT, \u223c61\u00b0-66\u00b0 invariant latitudes, \u223c0600 magnetic local time (MLT), and \u223c3800 km altitude during a storm on 25 July 2004. The Double Star (DS) TC1 satellite was located near the magnetic equator at L = 5.7, close to the same local time as FAST. We investigate the acceleration process of BBEs from the inner magnetosphere to near the ionosphere by comparing electron data obtained by FAST and DS TC1. We also investigate both plasma and field variations in the inner magnetosphere associated with substorm onset using DS TC1 data to examine the relationship between the BBEs and the storm time substorm. Ground geomagnetic field data show a positive H-bay at \u223c1349 UT at \u223c0600 MLT, indicating that a storm time substorm started just before the appearance of the BBEs. At \u223c1350 UT, a tailward ion flow was observed by DS TC1. Then, DS TC1 observed a local dipolarization and a drastic ion density enhancement at \u223c1351 UT, indicating that particle heating associated with the substorm was occurring in the inner magnetosphere. From \u223c1352 UT, electron fluxes were isotropically enhanced at energies above \u223c0.5 keV as observed by DS TC1. On the other hand, the pitch angle distribution of BBEs at the FAST altitude showed field-aligned lower-energy electrons below \u223c0.5 keV and isotropic higher-energy electrons above \u223c0.5 keV. From these data, it was inferred that the BBEs might consist of two energy components due to the acceleration or heating of electrons at different altitudes in association with the storm time substorm.",

The primary focus is on a comparison between the isolated substorm and the substorm that initiates the SMC. Auroral data from Polar UVI LBHl and LBHs, along with assimilative mapping of the ionosphere electrojet potential patterns are used as inputs to the global ionosphere-thermosphere model to calculate conductances and Joule heating rates. Results from this study show that the conductances both before and during the events play a large role the ability of the magnetosphere to remain in steady driven state. The substorm that initiates the SMC event shows very different signatures in the ionosphere than isolated substorm; these signatures indicate that there is very weak substorm current wedge, or possibly a pseudo-breakup.",

         "abstract": "Using a self-consistent global magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we investigate the transient behavior of the magnetosphere-ionosphere compound system during deformation of the magnetosphere after a northward turn of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We find that a peculiar Region 2 field-aligned current (R2 FAC) caused by a transient dynamo is enhanced in the ionosphere and, consequently, the convection field in the ionosphere is overshielded after the northward turn of the IMF. On the other hand, in the magnetosphere, the transient dynamo appears on the lower-latitude side of the dayside cleft. This dynamo is driven by the sunward convection flow that descends the enhanced pressure slope in the cleft region. This sunward flow and the enhanced pressure are caused by the release of magnetic tension accumulated in the southward IMF interval. Simultaneously, a counterclockwise vortex on a sphere of r = 8 Re (a clockwise vortex in the equatorial plane) in the afternoon sector appears in the magnetosphere. Consequently, the overshielding potential due to the R2 FAC in the ionosphere is a counterpart of the flow vortex in the magnetosphere. Finally, we note that the effect of the \u2207B/curvature drift, which is due to the ring current particles, may be insignificant because the dynamo responsible for the overshielding appears in the higher-latitude region.",

         "abstract": "This paper describes a novel method for quantitatively and routinely identifying auroral breakup following substorm onset using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms all-sky imagers. Substorm onset is characterized by a brightening of the aurora that is followed by auroral poleward expansion and auroral breakup. This breakup can be identified by a sharp increase in the auroral intensity i(t) and the time derivative of auroral intensity i(t). Utilizing both i(t) and i'(t), we have developed an algorithm for identifying the time interval and spatial location of auroral breakup during the substorm expansion phase based solely on quantifiable characteristics of the optical auroral emissions. We compare the time interval determined by the algorithm to independently identified auroral onset times from three previously published studies. In each case the time interval determined by the algorithm is within error of the onset independently identified by the prior studies. We further show the utility of the algorithm by comparing the breakup intervals determined using the automated algorithm to an independent list of substorm onset times. We demonstrate that 50% of the breakup intervals characterized by the algorithm are within the uncertainty of the times identified in the list. The quantitative description and routine identification of an interval of auroral brightening during the substorm expansion phase provides a foundation for unbiased statistical analysis of the aurora and to probe the physics of the auroral substorm and identify the processes leading to auroral substorm onset.",

The striking variations of simultaneous solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF-B<SUB>z</SUB> were not observed. Furthermore, we found that this IMF-B<SUB>x</SUB> discontinuity was a heliospheric current sheet, separating two high-speed solar wind streams with different velocity and magnetic polarity. In this study, the magnetic field and plasma data were obtained from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), Cluster, and GOES to investigate the magnetospheric responses, and those were taken from ACE and Geotail to monitor the solar wind conditions. Simultaneous geomagnetic field variations from the ground observatories and aurora activity from Polar were also examined. When the discontinuity encountered the magnetosphere, THEMIS-D, -E, and THEMIS-A observed abrupt and transient magnetic field and plasma variations in the dawnside near-Earth magnetotail and tail-flank magnetopause. Significant magnetic field perturbations were not observed by Cluster as located in the duskside magnetotail at this time interval. Although simultaneous dipolarization and negative bay variations with Pi2 waves were observed by GOES and the ground observatories, global auroral activities were not found. Around the dawnside tail-flank magnetopause, THEMIS-C and -A experienced the magnetopause crossings due to the magnetopause surface waves induced by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These results suggest that the magnetic field and plasma variations in the near-Earth magnetotail and tail-flank magnetopause were caused by moderate substorm-like phenomena and magnetopause surface waves. They also indicate that clear magnetospheric disturbances can be brought even without significant variations in the solar wind.",

Studies show that injections are associated with earthward propagating dipolarization fronts and suggest that particle acceleration can occur due to a combination of betatron acceleration during earthward convection and acceleration in the vicinity of magnetotail reconnection sites. Since observed energetic particle distributions vary from substorm to substorm, it is important to study acceleration mechanisms as a function of different substorm magnetotail configurations. In this paper, we discuss electron acceleration for two substorm events featuring different magnetotail configurations and particle acceleration processes. The study utilizes in situ observations, global MHD simulations, and large-scale-kinetic (LSK) simulations. The two substorms in question occurred on 15 February 2008 and 15 August 2001. The 15 February 2008 event was observed by the THEMIS spacecraft at x<SUB>GSE</SUB> ~ -10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, while the 15 August 2001 event was observed by Cluster spacecraft at x<SUB>GSE</SUB> ~ -20 R<SUB>E</SUB>. Earthward propagating dipolarization fronts are found in both the observations and the MHD simulations, which are driven by the solar wind conditions that existed during those events. The two simulations show that very different magnetotail configurations are formed for each event, with contrasting flows, magnetic reconnection configuration, and plasma sheet structure. We find that for the 15 February 2008 event reconnection is localized with a narrow region of high-speed flow. During this event, the electron velocity distribution functions f(v) are found to be anisotropic with f(v<SUB>\u22a5</SUB>) &gt; f(v<SUB>||</SUB>), where || and \u22a5 correspond to parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field. In contrast, for the 15 August 2001 event, there is a wide neutral line extending across the tail with low-speed flows. For this event, the distribution functions are anisotropic with f(v<SUB>||</SUB>) &gt; f(v<SUB>\u22a5</SUB>), the opposite sense as the 15 February 2008 event. We are able to relate these differences to the different magnetotail configurations seen during each event. These differences lead to contrasting occurrence rates of nonadiabatic acceleration. The differences between the magnetotail configurations during these two substorms may result from differences in the location of dayside reconnection. On 15 August 2001 the reconnection occurs on the flanks of the magnetopause, while on 15 February 2008 the reconnection occurs nearer the subsolar point.",

         "abstract": "Whether energetic electrons (10s of keV) in the magnetosheath can be directly transported into the magnetosphere and further energized through radial diffusion is significant in understanding the physical mechanisms for producing the radiation belt electrons (&gt;100s of keV) in the magnetosphere. In this study, we analyze more than two hundred magnetopause crossing events using the energetic electron and magnetic field measurements from Geotail and compare the flux and phase space density (PSD) of the energetic electrons on both sides of the magnetopause. It is found that for most of the events (&gt;70%), the fluxes and PSDs of energetic electrons in the magnetosheath are less than those in the magnetosphere, suggesting that the energetic electrons in the magnetosheath cannot be a direct source sufficient for the energetic electrons inside the magnetosphere. In fact, our analysis suggests a possible leakage of the energetic electrons from inside to outside the magnetopause. By investigating the average energetic electron flux distribution in the magnetosheath, we find that the energetic electron fluxes are higher near the bow shock and the magnetopause than in between. The high energetic electron flux near the bow shock can be understood as due to energization of electrons when they go through the bow shock. The relatively low flux of the energetic electrons in between indicates that it is difficult for the energetic electrons to travel from the bow shock to the magnetopause and vice versa, possibly because the energetic electrons near the bow shock and the magnetopause are all on open magnetic field lines and these two relatively intense energetic electron populations in the magnetosheath rarely get mixed.",

The relation between shifts of K<SUB>1</SUB> minima and K<SUB>2</SUB> peak intensities for violet and red wings appeared to be weak.

         "abstract": "The importance of the Jovian thermosphere with regard to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is often neglected in magnetospheric physics. We present the first study to investigate the response of the Jovian thermosphere to transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure, using an azimuthally symmetric global circulation model coupled to a simple magnetosphere and fixed auroral conductivity model. In our simulations, the Jovian magnetosphere encounters a solar wind shock or rarefaction region and is subsequently compressed or expanded. We present the ensuing response of the coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling terms, and the aurora to these transient events. Transient compressions cause the reversal, with respect to steady state, of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents and momentum transfer between the thermosphere and magnetosphere. They also cause at least a factor of two increase in the Joule heating rate. Ion drag significantly changes the kinetic energy of the thermospheric neutrals depending on whether the magnetosphere is compressed or expanded. Local temperature variations appear between ~-45 and 175 K for the compression scenario and ~-20 and 50 K for the expansion case. Extended regions of equatorward flow develop in the wake of compression events - we discuss the implications of this behaviour for global energy transport. Both compressions and expansions lead to a ~2000 TW increase in the total power dissipated or deposited in the thermosphere. In terms of auroral processes, transient compressions increase main oval UV emission by a factor of ~4.5 whilst transient expansions increase this main emission by a more modest 37%. Both types of transient event cause shifts in the position of the main oval, of up to 1\u00b0 latitude.",

Their properties are studied in order to determine if they may be considered as analogues to plasmoids and jets known to exist in Earth's magnetosheath. Both isolated decreases of the magnetic field absolute value ('negative magnetic field structures') and increases ('positive structures') are found in the magnetosheath, whereas only negative structures are found in the solar wind. The similar properties of the solar wind and magnetosheath negative magnetic field structures suggests that they are analogous to diamagnetic plasmoids found in Earth's magnetosheath and near solar wind. The latter have earlier been identified with solar wind magnetic holes. Positive magnetic field structures are only found in the magnetosheath, concentrated to a region relatively close to the magnetopause. Their proximity to the magnetopause, their scale sizes, and the association of a majority of the structures with bipolar magnetic field signatures identify them as flux transfer events (which generally are associated with a decrease of plasma density in the magnetosheath). The positive magnetic field structures are therefore not likely to be analogous to terrestrial paramagnetic plasmoids but possibly to a sub-population of magnetosheath jets. At Earth, a majority of magnetosheath jets are associated with the quasi-parallel bow shock. We discuss some consequences of the findings of the present investigation pertaining to the different nature of the quasi-parallel bow shock at Mercury and Earth.",

         "abstract": "A hydromagnetic stability problem is solved for the magnetospheric tail inside the solar wind plasma flow. A model magnetotail is used in the form of a plasma cylinder which is inhomogeneous over the radius. For a qualitative analysis of the problem the solution is obtained analytically, in the WKB approximation. The plasma cylinder boundary is assumed to have the form of a tangential discontinuity. A numeric solution was found for a more realistic model, with the boundary in the form of a smooth transition layer. This model cannot simulate such a feature of the actual magnetotail as its being divided into two lobes with opposite magnetic fields. It is capable, however, of simulating the finiteness of the magnetotail cross-section and the inhomogeneous plasma distribution over the radius. It is shown, analytically, that a local instability develops in the boundary when the velocity of the plasma flowing round the magnetosphere exceeds the Alfv\u00e9n speed at the magnetotail boundary. This conclusion is supported by a numerical solution of the problem for a model with its boundary in the form of a smooth transition layer. The instability increment, however, is much smaller in the latter case. Apart from a local instability of the boundary, unstable global modes are discovered whose amplitude practically does not vary over the magnetotail cross-section. These modes remain unstable for any, however, slow velocities of the plasma flowing round the magnetosphere. When the plasma flow velocity reaches a critical magnitude the global modes of the MHD oscillations become stable. Unstable global modes may be a source of ultra-low-frequency (\u223c1mHz) oscillations observed in the Earth's nightside magnetosphere.",

However, few previous observational studies of this coupling incorporated data that extended from the solar wind to deep into the ionosphere. Here we use solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere data obtained by the Mars Express spacecraft during March/April 2010 to investigate this coupling. We focus on three case studies, each centered on a pair of ionospheric electron density profiles measured by radio occultations, where the two profiles in each pair were obtained from the same location at an interval of only a few days. We find that high dynamic pressures in the solar wind are associated with compression of the magnetosphere, heating of the magnetosheath, reduction in the vertical extent of the ionosphere, and abrupt changes in electron density at the top of the ionosphere. The first three of these associations are analogous to the behavior of the plasma environment of Venus, but the final one is not. These results reinforce the notion that changes in solar forcing influence the behaviors of all of the tightly coupled regions within the Martian plasma environment.",

         "abstract": "A very tenuous solar wind regime, following a series of large coronal mass ejections, impacted Venus during early August, 2010. STEREO-B downstream from Venus observed that the solar wind density at Earth orbit dropped to \u223c0.1 #/cm<SUP>3</SUP> and persisted at this value over 1 day. A similar low value was observed at Earth in 1999 and has attracted comprehensive attention (Lazarus, A.J., 2000. Solar physics: the day the solar wind almost disappeared. Science 287, 2172-2173.), especially its consequences on Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere (Lockwood, M., 2001. Astronomy: the day the solar wind nearly died. Nature 409, 677-679.). We now have an opportunity to examine the response of Venus' ionosphere to such a tenuous solar wind. After Venus Express spacecraft entered the ionosphere near the terminator, it continuously sampled O<SUP>+</SUP> dominated planetary plasma on the nightside till it left the optical shadow region when Venus Express was located at 2 R<SUB>V</SUB> (Venus' Radii) to the Venus center and 1.1 R<SUB>V</SUB> to the Sun-Venus line. Moreover, the O<SUP>+</SUP> speed was lower than the gravitational escape speed. We interpret this low-speed O<SUP>+</SUP> as a constituent of the extended nightside ionosphere as a consequence of long-duration (18 h) tenuous solar wind, because the very low dynamic pressure enhances the source and reduces the sink of the nightside ionosphere. Though the full extent of the nightside ionosphere is not known due to the limitation of spacecraft's trajectory, our results suggest that the global configuration of Venus' ionosphere could resemble a teardrop-shaped cometary ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "MAVEN spacecraft provides new opportunities for analysis of Martian environment and physical process in near-Mars space. One of interesting regions of near-Mars space is the Martian magnetosphere that is formed from mass-loaded magnetic flux tubes. There is quite detailed knowledge of the night-side magnetosphere of Mars, however the number of publications on the dayside magnetosphere are quite limited. We analyze the plasma and magnetic structure and properties of Martian magnetosphere at strong mass-loading conditions as observed on MAVEN at Mars at the solar-zenith angle of \u223c80\u00b0 on January 4, 2015. This strong mass loading of upstream flow was apparently associated with plume ions ejected from upper part of Martian magnetosphere by the solar wind motional electric field. The magnetosphere is defined by two current layers separating it from the magnetosheath at higher altitudes and from ionosphere plasma at lower altitudes. It is characterized by dominance of planetary ions which number density increases by two orders of magnitude from upper boundary to lower one. There is approximate equipartition between magnetic, ion thermal and kinetic energies through magnetosphere. The data suggest that the boundary of the magnetosphere is in pressure equilibrium with magnetosheath flow. The total energy of ion flow above (in the magnetosheath) and below (in the region of accelerated ionospheric ions) magnetosphere exceeds the magnetic energy. The upper boundary of magnetosphere was located at the place where the ratio of heavy ions and protons number densities reached \u223c0.4. Within magnetosphere this ratio continued to rise and increased by about 2 orders of magnitude at the inner boundary of magnetosphere. The heavy ion number density profile within magnetosphere suggests that it was formed by the solar wind magnetic flux tubes that reached Mars in a narrow region near the subsolar point, and then drifted around Mars to the terminator region, mass-loaded by UV-ionized upper atmosphere neutrals during this drift.",

         "abstract": "The importance of the periodicity in sunspot appearance was well recognized by the mid-19th century. Several observatories around the globe have made the record of sunspots in the form of drawings and preserved them safely for posterity. At the Kodaikanal Observatory (KO), the sunspot observations have begun in 1905. In those times observations were recorded on photographic plates and after the development of those plates in the laboratory, the drawings of the same were made on the Stonyhurst grids. In these drawings, called sun charts, different features on the sun's disk, e.g., sunspots, plages, filaments, prominences, etc. were clearly identified and visually marked with different colors. We have collected 111 years of sunspot drawing spanning over 10 solar cycles. These sunspot drawings were carefully stitched to make bound volumes, each for every 6-months. The drawings are kept at the Kodaikanal library for scientific use and analysis. In this article, we describe briefly the process of drawing, methods of counting sunspot numbers and measurement of sunspot area using square grids. We have collected the data for the northern and southern hemispheres separately. From the collected data, we compute the sunspot number and area and compare it with Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) and Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) data. The results show that the measurement of the sunspot number is underestimated by about 40%. The KO monthly averaged sunspot number data of both hemispheres is normalized with the RGO monthly averaged total sunspot number data. This procedure provided a good correlated data set that can be used for further scientific work in the future. The sunspot area data from KO is slightly underestimated in the first 5-cycles and seems mildly overestimated in the later 5-cycles. These data sets are valuable additions to the existing data of sunspot records.",

         "abstract": "A number of fundamental questions as regards the physical nature of sunspots are formulated. In order to answer these questions, we apply the model of a round-shaped unipolar sunspot with a lower boundary consisting of cool plasma and with strong magnetic field at the depth of about 4 Mm beneath the photosphere, in accordance with the data of local helioseismology and with certain physically sound arguments (the shallow sunspot model). The magnetic configuration of a sunspot is assumed to be close to the observed one and similar to the magnetic field of a round solenoid of the appropriate size. The transverse (horizontal) and longitudinal (vertical) equilibria of a sunspot were calculated based on the thermodynamic approach and taking into account the magnetic, gravitational, and thermal energy of the spot and the pressure of the environment. The dependence of the magnetic field strength in the sunspot center, B <SUB>0</SUB>, on the radius of the sunspot umbra a is derived theoretically for the first time in the history of sunspot studies. It shows that the magnetic field strength in small spots is about 700 Gauss (G) and then increases monotonically with a, tending asymptotically to a limit value of about 4000 G. This dependence, B <SUB>0</SUB>( a) includes, as parameters, the gravity acceleration on the solar surface, the density of gas in the photosphere, and the ratio of the radius of the spot (including penumbra), a <SUB>p</SUB>, to the radius of its umbra a. It is shown that large-scale subsurface flows of gas in the sunspot vicinity, being the consequence but not the cause of sunspot formation, are too weak to contribute significantly to the pressure balance of the sunspot. Stability of the sunspot is provided by cooling of the sunspot plasma and decreasing of its gravitational energy due to the vertical redistribution of the gas density when the geometric Wilson depression of the sunspot is formed. The depth of a depression grows linearly with B <SUB>0</SUB>, in contrast to the quadratic law for the magnetic energy. Therefore, the range of stable equilibria turns out to be limited: large spots, with radius a larger than some limit value (about 12-18 Mm, depending on the magnetic field configuration), are unstable. It explains the absence of very large spots on the Sun and the appearance of light bridges in big spots that divide the spot into a few parts. The sunspots with B <SUB>0</SUB>\u22482.6\u00f72.7 kilogauss (kG) and a\u22485 Mm are most stable. For these spots, taken as a single magnetic structure, the period of their vertical eigen oscillations is minimal and amounts, according to the model, to 10-12 hours. It corresponds well to the period derived from the study of long-term oscillations of sunspots using SOHO/MDI data.",

         "abstract": "To better study the importance of the collision of different magnetic systems in generating magnetically complex sunspot groups and major (M- and X-class) flares, we define the index ALW: A r e a /LW, where LW represents the latitudinal width of the sunspot group band, and A r e a represents the total area of sunspot groups within the latitudinal width. Then, using the sunspot-group data collected by the United States Air Force/Mount Wilson Observatory and the flare data recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, we investigate the variations of the ALW-index, the percentage of complex sunspot groups, and the percentage of major flares in the northern and southern hemispheres during Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24. The main findings are reported as follows: First, in most cases, the maximum percentage of complex sunspot groups occurs after the maximum ALW is reached, and ALW starts to decrease. The result suggests that the collision of different magnetic systems cannot affect directly whether more complex sunspot groups are produced or more complex sunspot groups may be produced when there is a lower probability of the collision of different magnetic-flux systems, which does not support the suggestion of Jaeggli and Norton (Astrophys. J. Lett.820, L11, 2016). Second, in most cases, the maximum percentage of complex sunspot groups occurs after the maximum percentage of major flares is reached, and the percentage of major flares starts to decrease, supporting the suggestion of Nikbakhsh et al. (Astron. Astrophys.629, A45, 2019) - the large-scale dynamo peaks before the small-scale dynamo starts increasing, and the complex sunspot groups are linked to the small-scale dynamo taking over after the large-scale dynamo starts decreasing.",

         "abstract": "Forecasting of solar activity is extremely important, due to its impact on our space-based technology. In recent years, we have observed a continuous decline in the peak sunspot number for Solar Cycles (SCs) 21 to 24. We are more curious about peak activity of SC 25 because if the solar activity weakens further, then it may be an indication of new extended minima. So far, the daily sunspot-number data make up the longest observational series of the solar activity available, and recently this has been replaced with the corrected new Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. In general, different prediction models are available to forecast the peak smoothed sunspot number (SSN) of the upcoming SC but they are based on the older Version 1.0 sunspot data. Therefore, it is necessary to check the applicability of earlier proposed models to predict the peak SSN using the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. Here, we re-evaluate one such earlier proposed prediction model, which is based on the estimates of the Shannon entropy, a measure of randomness, for Version 2.0 sunspot data. We find that this prediction model is applicable to the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. To verify the robustness of the prediction model, we used the histogram and additionally the kernel density estimator (KDE) method to calculate the probability distribution function (PDF). The estimate of the PDF is a prerequisite to compute the Shannon entropy. We found that the prediction model is robust and the correlation coefficients between model parameters are 0.93 and 0.92, respectively, for these two approaches. This exercise provides a new prediction model for the peak SSN based on the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. The model forecasts the peak smoothed sunspot number of 136.9 \u00b124 using a histogram-derived PDF and 150.7 \u00b125 using a KDE-derived PDF for the upcoming SC 25. These predictions for SC 25 are more reliable as up to date (December 2020) sunspot-number data have been utilized to get the entropy in the end phase of SC 24. It suggests that SC 25 would be similar or slightly stronger than SC 24.",

         "abstract": "We compare horizontal flow fields in the photosphere and in the subphotosphere (a layer 0.5 Mm below the photosphere) in two solar active regions: AR 11084 and AR 11158. AR 11084 is a mature, simple active region without significant flaring activity, and AR 11158 is a multipolar, complex active region with magnetic flux emerging during the period studied. Flows in the photosphere are derived by applying the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) on HMI-observed vector magnetic fields, and the subphotospheric flows are inferred by time-distance helioseismology using HMI-observed Dopplergrams. Similar flow patterns are found for both layers for AR 11084: inward flows in the sunspot umbra and outward flows surrounding the sunspot. The boundary between the inward and outward flows, which is slightly different in the photosphere and the subphotosphere, is within the sunspot penumbra. The area having inward flows in the subphotosphere is larger than that in the photosphere. For AR 11158, flows in these two layers show great similarities in some areas and significant differences in other areas. Both layers exhibit consistent outward flows in the areas surrounding sunspots. On the other hand, most well-documented flux-emergence-related flow features seen in the photosphere do not have counterparts in the subphotosphere. This implies that the horizontal flows caused by flux emergence do not extend deeply into the subsurface.",

         "abstract": "The Maunder Minimum (1645 - 1715) was unique in terms of solar-cycle amplitudes and sunspot-position distributions registered in the last four centuries; however, little is known for its recovery and transition to the regular solar cycles until 1749 and the existing reconstructions vary from one to another here. This article presents a snapshot of Solar Cycle \u22123 including sunspot observations by Johann Christoph M\u00fcller (hereafter, JCM) in 1719 - 1720. We identified his sunspot drawings in the manuscript department of the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg and compiled his biographical profile and observational expertise. Subsequently, we analysed his sunspot drawings and derived the group number and positions of the observed sunspots. The results and comparative analyses with contemporary observations revealed that JCM reported up to five sunspot groups, corresponding well with Sebastian Alischer's records but contrasting with Johann Rost's records in the existing databases. These comparisons indicated that Rost's extremely large values recorded in 1719 - 1720 probably represented individual sunspot numbers instead of sunspot group numbers, unlike the understanding in the existing databases. Accordingly, JCM's group number forms a robust reference for representing the solar activity in 1719 - 1720 and exhibits relatively moderate solar cycle amplitude in the immediate aftermath of the Maunder Minimum. Moreover, JCM's sunspot drawings provide significantly detailed information on sunspot positions. Our analyses could locate the reported sunspot groups in both solar hemispheres, unlike those in the Maunder Minimum, which support the suggested transition between Solar Cycles \u22124 and \u22123.",

         "abstract": "The solar wind is filled with various magnetic field fluctuations, and one of the most widespread types of such fluctuations is solar wind discontinuities. They are rapid high-amplitude magnetic field rotations sharing properties of nonlinear Alfv\u00e9n waves and plane plasma slabs. They are believed to play an important role in the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. Most studies of solar wind discontinuities are based on observations in pristine solar wind, often by solar wind monitors at L1. However, before interacting with the Earth's magnetosphere, solar wind discontinuities cross the bow shock and can change their properties. In this study, we investigate the transformation of discontinuities due to the bow shock crossing. We compiled a set of 100 high-amplitude (&gt;3 nT) discontinuities observed by ARTEMIS in the upstream of the bow shock and by THEMIS in the downstream from the bow shock crossing (in the Earth's magnetosheath). Comparison of discontinuity properties in the solar wind and magnetosheath demonstrates discontinuity thinning and current density increase in the magnetosheath. Although all considered solar wind discontinuities mostly resemble rotational discontinuities, in the magnetosheath they start having properties of tangential discontinuities. We reveal a clear dawn-dusk asymmetry of discontinuity properties that are likely related to the asymmetry of the ion foreshock. We discuss how solar wind discontinuity transformation at the bow shock crossing can alter their interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.",

(Solar Phys.289, 4365, 2014b) to separate sunspot groups into large sunspot groups (D, E, and F classes in the modified Zurich classification) and simple sunspot groups (A and B classes) in Solar Cycles 22 - 24 collected by the United States Air Force/Mount Wilson Observatory (USAF/MWL). Then, using lagged-cross-correlation analysis and the block-bootstrap method, we calculate the correlation coefficients against time lags and determine the statistical significance of phase relation between large and simple sunspot groups in Solar Cycles 22 - 24, respectively. The main results that we obtained are summarized as follows: i) During Solar Cycles 22 and 24, the results - large sunspot groups lead or lag simple sunspot groups - are statistically insignificant and large sunspot groups should be in phase with simple sunspot groups. ii) During Solar Cycle 23, large sunspot groups statistically significantly lag simple sunspot groups in temporal phase.",

         "abstract": "We analyze the multiwavelength observations of an M2.9/1N flare that occurred in the active region (AR) NOAA 11112 in the vicinity of a huge filament system on 16 October 2010. SDO/HMI magnetograms reveal the emergence of a bipole (within the existing AR) 50 hours prior to the flare event. During the emergence, both the positive and negative sunspots in the bipole show translational as well as rotational motion. The positive-polarity sunspot shows significant motion/rotation in the south-westward/clockwise direction, and we see continuously pushing/sliding of the surrounding opposite-polarity field region. On the other hand, the negative-polarity sunspot moves/rotates in the westward/anticlockwise direction. The positive-polarity sunspot rotates \u2248 70<SUP>\u2218</SUP> within 30 hours, whereas the one with negative polarity rotates \u2248 20<SUP>\u2218</SUP> within 10 hours. SDO/AIA 94 \u00c5 EUV images show the emergence of a flux tube in the corona, consistent with the emergence of the bipole in HMI. The footpoints of the flux tube were anchored in the emerging bipole. The initial brightening starts at one of the footpoints (western) of the emerging loop system, where the positive-polarity sunspot pushes/slides towards a nearby negative-polarity field region. A high speed plasmoid ejection (speed \u2248 1197 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) was observed during the impulsive phase of the flare, which suggests magnetic reconnection of the emerging positive-polarity sunspot with the surrounding opposite-polarity field region. The entire AR shows positive-helicity injection before the flare event. Moreover, the newly emerging bipole reveals the signature of a negative (left-handed) helicity. These observations provide unique evidence of the emergence of twisted flux tubes from below the photosphere to coronal heights, triggering a flare mainly due to the interaction between the emerging positive-polarity sunspot and a nearby negative-polarity sunspot by the shearing motion of the emerging positive sunspot towards the negative one. Our observations also strongly support the idea that the rotation can most likely be attributed to the emergence of twisted magnetic fields, as proposed by recent models.",

         "abstract": "Large sunspots can be observed with the unaided eye under suitable atmospheric seeing conditions. Such observations are of particular value because the frequency of their appearance provides an approximate indication of the prevailing level of solar activity. Unaided-eye sunspot observations can be traced back well before the start of telescopic observations of the Sun, especially in the East Asian historical records. It is therefore important to compare more modern, unaided-eye sunspot observations with the results of telescopic sunspot observations, to gain a better understanding of the nature of the unaided-eye sunspot records. A previous comparison of Chinese unaided-eye sunspot records and Greenwich photo-heliographic results between 1874 and 1918 indicated that a few of the unaided-eye observations were apparently not supported by direct photographic evidence of at least one sunspot with a large area. This article reveals that one of such Chinese unaided-eye observations had possibly captured the transit of Venus on 9 December 1874. The Chinese sunspot records on this date are compared with Western sunspot observations on the same day. It is concluded that sunspots on the solar disk were quite small and the transit of Venus was probably misinterpreted as a sunspot (black spot) by the Chinese local intellectuals. This case indicates that sunspots or comparable \"obscuring\" objects with an area as large as 1000 millionths of the solar disk could reasonably have been seen with the unaided eye under suitable seeing conditions. It also confirms the visibility of sunspots near the solar limb with the unaided eye. This study provides an explanation of the apparent discrepancy between the Chinese unaided-eye sunspot observation on 9 December 1874 and the Western sunspot observations using telescopes, as well as a basis for further discussion on the negative pairs in 1900 and 1911, apparently without sufficiently large area.",

         "abstract": "We investigate how helioseismic waves that originate from effective point sources interact with a sunspot. These waves are reconstructed from observed stochastic wavefields on the Sun by cross-correlating photospheric Doppler-velocity signals. We select the wave sources at different locations relative to the sunspot, and investigate the p- and f-mode waves separately. The results reveal a complicated picture of waveform perturbations caused by the wave interaction with the sunspot. In particular, it is found that for waves originating from outside of the sunspot, p-mode waves travel across the sunspot with a small amplitude reduction and slightly higher speed, and wave amplitude and phase get mostly restored to the quiet-Sun values after passing the sunspot. The f-mode wave experiences some amplitude reduction passing through the sunspot, and the reduced amplitude is not recovered after that. The wave-propagation speed does not change before encountering the sunspot and inside the sunspot, but the wavefront becomes faster than the reference wave after passing through the sunspot. For waves originating from inside the sunspot umbra, both f- and p-mode waves show significant amplitude reductions and faster speed for all propagation paths. A comparison of positive and negative time lags of cross-correlation functions shows an apparent asymmetry in the waveform changes for both the f- and p-mode waves. We suggest that the waveform variations of the helioseismic waves interacting with a sunspot found in this article can be used for developing a method of waveform heliotomography, similar to the waveform tomography of the Earth.",

         "abstract": "The daily number of sunspot groups on the solar disk, as recorded by the programme of sunspot observations performed under the aegis of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, UK, and subsequently the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), is re-examined for the interval 1874 - 1885. The motivation for this re-examination is the key role that the RGO number of sunspot groups plays in the calculation of Group Sunspot Numbers (Hoyt and Schatten in Solar Phys. 179, 189, 1998a; Solar Phys. 181, 491, 1998b). A new dataset has been derived for the RGO daily number of sunspot groups in the interval 1874 - 1885. This new dataset attempts to achieve complete consistency between the sunspot data presented in the three main sections of the RGO publications and also incorporates all known errata and additions. It is argued that days for which no RGO solar photograph was acquired originally should be regarded, without exception, as being days without meaningful sunspot data. The daily number of sunspot groups that Hoyt and Schatten assign to days without RGO photographs is frequently just a lower limit. Moreover, in the absence of a solar photograph, the daily number of sunspot groups is inevitably uncertain because of the known frequent occurrence of sunspot groups that exist for just a single day. The elimination of days without photographs changes the list of inter-comparison days on which both the primary RGO observer and a specified secondary comparison observer saw at least one sunspot group. The resulting changes in the personal correction factors of secondary observers then change the personal correction factors of overlapping tertiary observers, etc. In this way, numerical changes in the personal correction factors of secondary observers propagate away from the interval 1874 - 1885, thereby potentially changing the arithmetical calculation of Group Sunspot Numbers over an appreciably wider time interval.",

         "abstract": "We use five test data series to search for, and quantify, putative discontinuities around 1946 in five different annual-mean sunspot-number or sunspot-group-number data sequences. The data series tested are the original and new versions of the Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number composite [R_{{ISNv1}} and R_{{ISNv2}}] (respectively Clette et al. in Adv. Space Res. 40, 919, 2007 and Clette et al. in The Solar Activity Cycle 35, Springer, New York, 2015); the corrected version of R <SUB>ISNv1</SUB> proposed by Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard ( J. Geophys. Res. 119, 5193, 2014a) [R <SUB>C</SUB>]; the new \"backbone\" group-number composite proposed by Svalgaard and Schatten ( Solar Phys. 291, 2016) [R_{{BB}}]; and the new group-number composite derived by Usoskin et al. ( Solar Phys. 291, 2016) [R_{{UEA}}]. The test data series used are the group-number [N<SUB>G</SUB>] and total sunspot area [A <SUB>G</SUB>] from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich/Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) photoheliographic data; the Ca K index from the recent re-analysis of Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) spectroheliograms in the Calcium ii K ion line; the sunspot-group-number from the MWO sunspot drawings [N_{{MWO}}]; and the dayside ionospheric F2-region critical frequencies measured by the Slough ionosonde [foF2]. These test data all vary in close association with sunspot numbers, in some cases non-linearly. The tests are carried out using both the before-and-after fit-residual comparison method and the correlation method of Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard, applied to annual mean data for intervals iterated to minimise errors and to eliminate uncertainties associated with the precise date of the putative discontinuity. It is not assumed that the correction required is by a constant factor, nor even linear in sunspot number. It is shown that a non-linear correction is required by R<SUB>C</SUB>, R_{BB}, and R_{{ISNv1}}, but not by R_{{ISNv2}} or R_{{UEA}}. The five test datasets give very similar results in all cases. By multiplying the probability distribution functions together, we obtain the optimum correction for each sunspot dataset that must be applied to pre-discontinuity data to make them consistent with the post-discontinuity data. It is shown that, on average, values for 1932 - 1943 are too low (relative to later values) by about 12.3 % for R_{{ISNv1}} but are too high for R_{{ISNv2}} and R_{BB} by 3.8 % and 5.2 %, respectively. The correction that was applied to generate R<SUB>C</SUB> from R <SUB>ISNv1</SUB> reduces this average factor to 0.5 % but does not remove the non-linear variation with the test data, and other errors remain uncorrected. A valuable test of the procedures used is provided by R_{{UEA}}, which is identical to the RGO N<SUB>G</SUB> values over the interval employed.",

         "abstract": "More than 70 years ago, it was recognised that ionospheric F2-layer critical frequencies [foF2] had a strong relationship to sunspot number. Using historic datasets from the Slough and Washington ionosondes, we evaluate the best statistical fits of foF2 to sunspot numbers (at each Universal Time [UT] separately) in order to search for drifts and abrupt changes in the fit residuals over Solar Cycles 17 - 21. This test is carried out for the original composite of the Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number [R], the new \"backbone\" group sunspot number [R_{BB}], and the proposed \"corrected sunspot number\" [R<SUB>C</SUB>]. Polynomial fits are made both with and without allowance for the white-light facular area, which has been reported as being associated with cycle-to-cycle changes in the sunspot-number-foF2 relationship. Over the interval studied here, R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> largely differ in their allowance for the \"Waldmeier discontinuity\" around 1945 (the correction factor for which for R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> is, respectively, zero, effectively over 20 %, and explicitly 11.6 %). It is shown that for Solar Cycles 18 - 21, all three sunspot data sequences perform well, but that the fit residuals are lowest and most uniform for R_{BB}. We here use foF2 for those UTs for which R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> all give correlations exceeding 0.99 for intervals both before and after the Waldmeier discontinuity. The error introduced by the Waldmeier discontinuity causes R to underestimate the fitted values based on the foF2 data for 1932 - 1945, but R_{BB} overestimates them by almost the same factor, implying that the correction for the Waldmeier discontinuity inherent in R_{BB} is too large by a factor of two. Fit residuals are smallest and most uniform for R<SUB>C</SUB>, and the ionospheric data support the optimum discontinuity multiplicative correction factor derived from the independent Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) sunspot group data for the same interval.",

The radial and vertical profiles of pressure, plasma density, and temperature in the visible layers of the sunspot are calculated. The reduction in plasma density in the magnetic funnel of the sunspot, corresponding to the Wilson depression, is also obtained. The magnetic structure of the sunspot is given analytically in a realistic way: a part of the magnetic flux of the sunspot approaches the surrounding photosphere at the outer edge of the penumbra. The magnetic field of the sunspot is not assumed to be axially symmetric. For the first time, the angular dependence of the physical variables in this model allows us to simulate not only a deviation from the circular shape of the sunspot, but also a fine filamentary structure of the sunspot penumbra. The Alfv\u00e9n Mach number (the ratio of the plasma speed to the Alfv\u00e9n speed) is zero at the center of the sunspot and rises slowly toward the periphery of the sunspot; this corresponds to the structure of the Evershed flow in the penumbra. The Evershed flow in our model is mainly concentrated in dark penumbral filaments, as is observed.",

         "abstract": "Designing a statistical solar flare forecasting technique can benefit greatly from knowledge of the flare frequency of occurrence with respect to sunspot groups. This study analyzed sunspot groups and H\u03b1 and X-ray flares reported for the period 1997 - 2007. Annual catalogs were constructed, listing the days that numbered sunspot groups were observed (designated sunspot group-days, SSG-Ds) and for each day a record for each associated H\u03b1 flare of importance category one or greater and normal or bright brightness and for each X-ray flare of intensity C 5 or higher. The catalogs were then analyzed to produce frequency distributions of SSG-Ds by year, sunspot group class, likelihood of producing at least one flare overall and by sunspot group class, and frequency of occurrence of numbers of flares per day and flare intensity category. Only 3% of SSG-Ds produced a substantial H\u03b1 flare and 7% had a significant X-ray flare. We found that mature, complex sunspot groups were more likely than simple sunspot groups to produce a flare, but the latter were more prevalent than the former. More than half of the SSG-Ds with flares had a maximum intensity flare greater than the lowest category (C-class of intensity five and higher). The fact that certain sunspot group classes had flaring probabilities significantly higher than the combined probabilities of the intensity categories when all SSG-Ds were considered suggest that it might be best to first predict the flaring probability. For sunspot groups found likely to flare, a separate diagnosis of maximum flare intensity category appears feasible.",

         "abstract": "This paper summarizes the results obtained by the team \"Heliosheath Processes and the Structure of the Heliopause: Modeling Energetic Particles, Cosmic Rays, and Magnetic Fields\" supported by the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern, Switzerland. We focus on the physical processes occurring in the outer heliosphere, especially at its boundary called the heliopause, and in the local interstellar medium. The importance of magnetic field, charge exchange between neutral atoms and ions, and solar cycle on the heliopause topology and observed heliocentric distances to different heliospheric discontinuities are discussed. It is shown that time-dependent, data-driven boundary conditions are necessary to describe the heliospheric asymmetries detected by the Voyager spacecraft. We also discuss the structure of the heliopause, especially due to its instability and magnetic reconnection. It is demonstrated that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the nose of the heliopause creates consecutive layers of the interstellar and heliospheric plasma which are magnetically connected to different sources. This may be a possible explanation of abrupt changes in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by Voyager 1 when it was crossing the heliopause structure for a period of about one month in the summer of 2012. This paper also discusses the plausibility of fitting simulation results to a number of observational data sets obtained by in situ and remote measurements. The distribution of magnetic field in the vicinity of the heliopause is discussed in the context of Voyager measurements. It is argued that a classical heliospheric current sheet formed due to the Sun's rotation is not observed by in situ measurements and should not be expected to exist in numerical simulations extending to the boundary of the heliosphere. Furthermore, we discuss the transport of energetic particles in the inner and outer heliosheath, concentrating on the anisotropic spatial diffusion diffusion tensor and the pitch-angle dependence of perpendicular diffusion and demonstrate that the latter can explain the observed pitch-angle anisotropies of both the anomalous and galactic cosmic rays in the outer heliosheath.",

Recent spacecraft observations of magnetic turbulence in the ion foreshock, in the magnetosheath, in the polar cusp regions, in the magnetotail, and in the high latitude ionosphere are reviewed. It is found that: 1. A large share of magnetic turbulence in the geospace environment is generated locally, as due for instance to the reflected ion beams in the ion foreshock, to temperature anisotropy in the magnetosheath and the polar cusp regions, to velocity shear in the magnetosheath and magnetotail, and to magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail. 2. Spectral indices close to the Kolmogorov value can be recovered for low frequency turbulence when long enough intervals at relatively constant flow speed are analyzed in the magnetotail, or when fluctuations in the magnetosheath are considered far downstream from the bow shock. 3. For high frequency turbulence, a spectral index \u03b1\u22432.3 or larger is observed in most geospace regions, in agreement with what is observed in the solar wind. 4. More studies are needed to gain an understanding of turbulence dissipation in the geospace environment, also keeping in mind that the strong temperature anisotropies which are observed show that wave particle interactions can be a source of wave emission rather than of turbulence dissipation. 5. Several spacecraft observations show the existence of vortices in the magnetosheath, on the magnetopause, in the magnetotail, and in the ionosphere, so that they may have a primary role in the turbulent injection and evolution. The influence of such a turbulence on the plasma transport, dynamics, and energization will be described, also using the results of numerical simulations.",

         "abstract": "Auroral substorms are mostly manifestations of dissipative processes of electromagnetic energy. Thus, we consider a sequence of processes consisting of the power supply (dynamo), transmission (currents/circuits) and dissipations (auroral substorms-the end product), namely the electric current line approach. This work confirms quantitatively that after accumulating magnetic energy during the growth phase, the magnetosphere unloads the stored magnetic energy impulsively in order to stabilize itself. This work is based on our result that substorms are caused by two current systems, the directly driven (DD) current system and the unloading system (UL). The most crucial finding in this work is the identification of the UL (unloading) current system which is responsible for the expansion phase. A very tentative sequence of the processes leading to the expansion phase (the generation of the UL current system) is suggested for future discussions. <P />(1) The solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo enhances significantly the plasma sheet current when its power is increased above 10^{18} erg/s (10^{11} w). <P />(2) The magnetosphere accumulates magnetic energy during the growth phase, because the ionosphere cannot dissipate the increasing power because of a low conductivity. As a result, the magnetosphere is inflated, accumulating magnetic energy. <P />(3) When the power reaches 3-5\u00d7 10^{18} erg/s (3-5\u00d7 10^{11} w) for about one hour and the stored magnetic energy reaches 3-5\u00d710^{22} ergs (10^{15} J), the magnetosphere begins to develop perturbations caused by current instabilities (the current density {\u2248}3\u00d7 10^{-12} A/cm<SUP>2</SUP> and the total current {\u2248}10<SUP>6</SUP> A at 6 Re). As a result, the plasma sheet current is reduced. <P />(4) The magnetosphere is thus deflated. The current reduction causes partial B/partial t &gt; 0 in the main body of the magnetosphere, producing an earthward electric field. As it is transmitted to the ionosphere, it becomes equatorward-directed electric field which drives both Pedersen and Hall currents and thus generates the UL current system. <P />(5) A significant part of the magnetic energy is accumulated in the main body of the magnetosphere (the inner plasma sheet) between 4 Re and 10 Re, because the power (Poynting flux [ E \u00d7 B ]) is mainly directed toward this region which can hold the substorm energy. <P />(6) The substorm intensity depends on the location of the energy accumulation (between 4 Re and 10 Re), the closer the location to the earth, the more intense substorms becomes, because the capacity of holding the energy is higher at closer distances. The convective flow toward the earth brings both the ring current and the plasma sheet current closer when the dynamo power becomes higher. <P />This proposed sequence is not necessarily new. Individual processes involved have been considered by many, but the electric current approach can bring them together systematically and provide some new quantitative insights.",

         "abstract": "The ionosphere and its activities play an important role in radio communications, space science and positioning. In this paper, we present efficiency of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in ionosphere time series prediction at severe solar activity periods. The high accuracy prediction of the ionosphere total electron content (TEC) using ANFIS is the main purpose of the paper. Also, investigation of the daily, monthly and annually temporal behavior of the ionosphere is another goal of the paper. Three GPS stations (ANKR, ANTL and ZONG) from Turkish permanent GPS network (TPGN) are selected for analysis. These stations are at mid-latitudes. To predict and analyze ionospheric temporal behavior, observations of the 2014-2015 are selected. The index of solar activity in these 2 years is the maximum. Training of ANFIS is done by back-propagation (BP) algorithm. In order to analyze the accuracy of the proposed method, testing step has been performed in different days, months and seasons and compared with the global ionosphere map (GIM) TEC as a traditional ionosphere model, as well as, international reference ionosphere 2016 (IRI2016) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. To validate the results, root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, relative error, dTEC = |TEC<SUB>GPS</SUB>-TEC<SUB>MODEL</SUB>| and residual histogram are used. At testing step, the maximum correlation coefficient obtained 0.869 for the ANFIS. Also, the minimum RMSE of 3.131 TECU is computed for ANFIS at testing step. Using the ANFIS model, the daily, monthly and annual variations of the ionosphere time series are revealed with high accuracy. The results show that the ANFIS model is a reliable and high-precision alternative to the conventional ionosphere models in Turkish region.",

         "abstract": "A key objective of space situational awareness is to provide an accurate characterization of state uncertainty of space objects (SOs) in order to support predictive analytics, such as assessments of the probability of collision with other SOs. Due to a large number of SOs in comparison with the limited number of sensors available for tracking them, physics based uncertainty forecasting is often required for long periods, during which state uncertainty can become highly non-Gaussian. In this paper, we consider the problem of uncertainty forecasting in perturbed two-body dynamics via adaptive Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). While widely used, the standard Monte Carlo approach is limited by two main challenges: i.) its slow rate of convergence, which is especially detrimental to its application in complex systems where each simulation is computationally expensive; and ii.) ambiguity in the ensemble's capability to \"accurately\" characterize the true state-pdf over time with a fixed ensemble size, given the fact that the propagated state uncertainty is time-varying and unknown in advance. We employ a newly developed adaptive Monte Carlo method that aims to characterize the propagated state-pdf within user defined accuracy bounds in the perturbed two-body dynamics. In the adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm, the transient performance of MCS is quantified in terms of the standard deviation of its approximation error, which is estimated via bootstrapping. A particle addition scheme is activated when the approximation error exceeds the user-defined upper bound at the current time and new particles are introduced sequentially, one at a time. These are selected through a two-layered algorithm that (a.) enforces optimal inter-particle projective distance, and (b.) minimizes sample discrepancy with respect to the true initial state-pdf in terms of the space-filling and non-collapsing properties. On the other hand, particles are removed (halted) for future propagation when current MCS error is estimated to be lower than the user defined threshold, in the interest of reducing computational load. Particle removal is dependent on their own evolved probability-density values which are obtained by solving the corresponding stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) numerically. As a result, the proposed approach is expected to generate a \"minimal\" ensemble of particles to characterize the propagated state-pdf within user defined accuracy bounds at all future times. Numerical simulations are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting method.",

         "abstract": "This paper examines the dominant submonthly variability of zonally symmetrical atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter within the context of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), with particular emphasis on interactive stratosphere-troposphere processes. The submonthly variability is identified and measured using a daily NAM index, which concentrates primarily on zonally symmetrical circulation. A schematic lifecycle of submonthly variability is developed that reveals a two-way coupling process between the stratosphere and troposphere in the NH polar region. Specifically, anomalous tropospheric zonal winds in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Arctic propagate upwards to the low stratosphere, disturbing the polar vortex, and resulting in an anomalous stratospheric geopotential height (HGT) that subsequently propagates down into the troposphere and changes the sign of the surface circulations. From the standpoint of planetary-scale wave activities, a feedback loop is also evident when the anomalous planetary-scale waves (with wavenumbers 2 and 3) propagate upwards, which disturbs the anomalous zonally symmetrical flow in the low stratosphere, and induces the anomalous HGT to move poleward in the low stratosphere, and then propagates down into the troposphere. This increases the energy of waves at wavenumbers 2 and 3 in the low troposphere in middle latitudes by enhancing the land-sea contrast of the anomalous HGT field. Thus, this study supports the viewpoint that the downward propagation of stratospheric NAM signals may not originate in the stratosphere.",

         "abstract": "The infrared radiative effect of methane was analyzed using the 2D, interactive chemical dynamical radiative SOCRATES model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Then, a sensitivity experiment, with the methane volume mixing ratio increased by 10%, was carried out to study the influence of an increase of methane on air temperature. The results showed that methane has a heating effect through the infrared radiative process in the troposphere and a cooling effect in the stratosphere. However, the cooling effect of the methane is much smaller than that of water vapor in the stratosphere and is negligible in the mesosphere. The simulation results also showed that when methane concentration is increased by 10%, the air temperature lowers in the stratosphere and mesosphere and increases in the troposphere. The cooling can reach 0.2 K at the stratopause and can vary from 0.2-0.4 K in the mesosphere, and the temperature rise varies by around 0.001-0.002 K in the troposphere. The cooling results from the increase of the infrared radiative cooling rate caused by increased water vapor and O<SUB>3</SUB> concentration, which are stimulated by the increase in methane in most of the stratosphere. The infrared radiation cooling of methane itself is minor. The depletion of O<SUB>3</SUB> stimulated by the methane increase results indirectly in a decrease in the rate of solar radiation heating, producing cooling in the stratopause and mesosphere. The tropospheric warming is mainly caused by the increase of methane, which produces infrared radiative heating. The increase in H<SUB>2</SUB>O and O<SUB>3</SUB> caused by the methane increase also contributes to a rise in temperature in the troposphere.",

Solar synoptic maps of He I 10830 \u00c5 intensity, which are observed at National Solar Observatory/Kitt Peak from Jul. 2005 to Mar. 2013 are utilized to investigate the phase relation of long-term evolution of the quiet chromosphere represented by He I intensity with the solar cycle represented by sunspot number. The phase relationship of the He I chromosphere at low and middle latitudes with the solar cycle is found to show an interesting phenomenon, black under the light: (1) at most of the latitudes of the conspicuous active chromosphere (the butterfly diagram), the relationship is anti-phase, but at the latitudes outside the butterfly diagram (the inconspicuous background chromosphere), it is in-phase; and (2) the He I intensity averaged over the low latitudes of 0- 30 \u00b0 is in anti-phase with the solar cycle, but after deducing some relatively small values of He I intensity, the anti-phase relationship is reversed to be in-phase. Long-term variation of He I intensity at the full disk of the quiet chromosphere is believed to be in phase with the solar cycle, and accordingly, the temporal evolution of the heated quiet chromosphere is in phase with long-term variation of the small-scale magnetic elements whose flux is (2.9 - 32.0) \u00d710<SUP>18</SUP> Mx, and it provides evidence for the heating of the quiet chromosphere mainly by the magnetic elements. Implication of the findings is discussed, and especially, the long-term variation of total solar irradiance measured at low latitudes is inferred to be significantly different from that at high latitudes.",

         "abstract": "The high variability of the Sun's magnetic field is responsible for the generation of perturbations that propagate throughout the heliosphere. Such disturbances often drive interplanetary shocks in front of their leading regions. Strong shocks transfer momentum and energy into the solar wind ahead of them which in turn enhance the solar wind interaction with magnetic fields in its way. Shocks then eventually strike the Earth's magnetosphere and trigger a myriad of geomagnetic effects observed not only by spacecraft in space, but also by magnetometers on the ground. Recently, it has been revealed that shocks can show different geoeffectiveness depending closely on the angle of impact. Generally, frontal shocks are more geoeffective than inclined shocks, even if the former are comparatively weaker than the latter. This review is focused on results obtained from modeling and experimental efforts in the last 15 years. Some theoretical and observational background are also provided. <P />&lt;/ce:displayed-quote&gt;The possibility of the existence of shocks in the interplanetary space was then accepted. Parker (1961) suggested a model for shock propagation in the interplanetary space. His idea was further extended by Hundhausen and Gentry (1969). However, the first evidences of collisionless shocks in nature were observed in the interplanetary space. As seen above, the existence of the magnetosphere suggested the formation of a stationary collisionless shock at the front of the magnetosphere. Curiously, the existence of a stationary shock, i.e., a shock at rest in the Earth's reference frame, was suggested in the same edition of the Journal of Geophysical Research by Axford (1962) and Kellogg (1962). The bow shock was first observed by the Mariner 2 spacecraft as irreversible changes in the solar wind and IMF which were interpreted as hydromagnetic shocks (Ness et al., 1964; Sonett et al., 1964). The bow shock is formed if a supersonic flow interacts with an obstacle, and it separates the pristine solar wind from the subsonic plasma flow in the magnetosheath. Another magnetospheric boundary is the magnetopause, a current layer whose position is determined by the pressure balance condition between the solar wind dynamic pressure and the magnetospheric magnetic pressure, first observed by Heppner et al. (1963) and Cahill and Amazeen (1963). The region between the bow shock and the magnetopause is called the magnetosheath. The magnetosheath in the subsolar region for typical solar wind conditions is located approximately at a distance between 10R<SUB>E</SUB> and 13R<SUB>E</SUB> (Earth radius of \u223c 6400 km) from the Earth (Cahill and Amazeen, 1963; Heppner et al., 1963; Russell, 1984). This region is highly turbulent because it is formed by the shocked solar wind (Russell, 1984; Paschmann, 2005). The bow shock, magnetopause, and magnetosheath are shown in Fig. 2, as seen in Eastwood et al. (2014). The numerical gas dynamic model of Spreiter et al. (1966) reasonably well predicted the bow shock formation and magnetosheath flow between the bow shock and magnetopause obstacle. For a broader perspective on the discovery of the magnetosphere, see, e.g., Russell (1984) and Gillmor and Spreiter (1997).&lt;/ce:para&gt;",

We focus on the role of planetary and gravity waves in driving the middle atmosphere circulation and illustrate the stratosphere-mesosphere coupling during undisturbed wintertime circulation, during an SSW event, and after an SSW event during the formation of an elevated stratopause using simulations of past Arctic and Antarctic winters from the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). We illustrate the transition of the polar stratopause from being a gravity wave driven phenomena to a planetary wave driven phenomena during SSW events and its subsequent reestablishment and control by gravity waves. We also examine the synoptic structure of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere using SD-WACCM data fields that show the structure of the vortex during specific dynamical events in both hemispheres. We illustrate the longitudinal asymmetry in the thermal structure in the stratosphere and mesosphere driven by differences in circulation over the polar cap regions during an SSW event. We complement this analysis of the middle atmosphere circulation with a classification of both the Arctic and Antarctic winters since 1979 into major, minor, elevated stratopause or quiet winters based on the level of disturbance using the Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis data. From the MERRA data we find that the combined occurrences of both major and minor warmings in the Arctic have remained constant over the past three decades while we find a minor increase in their occurrences in the Antarctic.",

         "abstract": "Observations made with the two Voyager spacecraft confirmed that the solar wind decelerates to form the heliospheric termination shock. Voyager 1 crossed this termination shock at \u223c94 AU in 2004, while Voyager 2 crossed it in 2007 at a different heliolatitude, about 10 AU closer to the Sun. These different positions of the termination shock confirm the dynamic and cyclic nature of the shock's position. Observations from the two Voyager spacecraft inside the heliosheath indicate significant differences between them, suggesting that apart from the dynamic nature caused by changing solar activity there also may exist a global asymmetry in the north-south (polar) dimensions of the heliosphere, in addition to the expected nose-tail asymmetry. This relates to the direction in which the heliosphere is moving in interstellar space and its orientation with respect to the interstellar magnetic field. In this paper we focus on illustrating the effects of this north-south asymmetry on modulation of galactic cosmic ray Carbon, between polar angles of 55\u00b0 and 125\u00b0, using a numerical model which includes all four major modulation processes, the termination shock and the heliosheath. This asymmetry is incorporated in the model by assuming a significant dependence on heliolatitude of the thickness of the heliosheath. When comparing the computed spectra between the two polar angles, we find that at energies E &lt; \u223c1.0 GeV the effects of the assumed asymmetry on the modulated spectra are insignificant up to 60 AU from the Sun but become increasingly more significant with larger radial distances to reach a maximum inside the heliosheath. In contrast, with E &gt; \u223c1.0 GeV, these effects remain insignificant throughout the heliosphere even very close to the heliopause. Furthermore, we find that a higher local interstellar spectrum for Carbon enhances the effects of asymmetric modulation between the two polar angles at lower energies ( E &lt; \u223c300 MeV). In conclusion, it is found that north-south asymmetrical effects on the modulation of cosmic ray Carbon depend strongly on the extent of the geometrical asymmetry of the heliosheath together with the assumed value of the local interstellar spectrum.",

         "abstract": "We present the method of automatic forecasting of the impacts of Solar Cosmic Ray (SCR)/Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) and estimation of radiation hazard level. We use the model of SCR/SEP diffusion in general form and coupling functions for neutron monitors of worldwide network with different altitudes and cutoff rigidities, including space detectors such as GOES-11,12. Another observational data for the estimation of energy spectra of SCR/SEP are measurements of different neutron multiplicities by some neutron monitors (e.g., for great SCR/SEP event held in September 29, 1989). A 1-min data of muon telescopes and ionization chambers shielded by 10-cm PB are used for the detection of the highest-energy SCR/SEP components (e.g., for SCR/SEP events held on February 23, 1956; Dorman, 1957). We demonstrate algorithms to automatically estimate event starting times, determine the time evolution of SCR/SEP in space using coupling functions in the frame of spectrographic method, solve inverse problems associated with SCR/SEP generation in solar corona and propagation in the interplanetary space, automatically determine escaping into solar wind and propagation in space based on the CR observation data parameters of SCR/SEP generation and propagation in solar corona. Based on these parameters, we show that it is possible to automatically forecast the first 0.5 h data on expected level of radiation hazards from a full-time event (up to about 48 h) for objects in space on different distances from the Sun, in magnetosphere at different orbits, and in atmosphere at different altitudes and cutoff rigidities. It is important, before the start of the automatic forecasting procedure, to calculate the expected level of radiation hazards for full time of event by determining every 5-10 min recalculated forecasting fluxes of SCR/SEP in space, out of magnetosphere, back to the CR ground detectors, and detectors on satellites using the same coupling functions. If the difference between the obtained results and observed data is smaller or no statistical errors, it is possible to provide effective forecasting automatically and subsequently calculate the expected level of radiation hazards. If the expected level of radiation hazards is high in certain objects, after about 0.5 h from the event starting time, it will be formatted and a corresponding alert is sent. The same alerts will be repeated with time for different objects in space, in magnetosphere, and in atmosphere. Based on the first 0.5 h data from event beginning, the radiation hazard level from high-energy particles such as SCR/SEP is considered to be low (with very small flux). If with increasing time the radiation hazard level rises with energy \u22641 GeV, it is formatted. Also, at the beginning of some SCR/SEP events when the Earth is on or near the force line of IMF connected with the source of SCR/SEP, several CR stations with direct arriving along the magnetic force line with about no scattering SCR/SEP particles on magnetic inhomogeneities will show strong narrow pulse with no information on SCR/SEP diffusion during the propagation from the source to the detector. These CR stations at the beginning of the SCR/SEP event can be used only for estimating SCR/SEP energy spectrum in the source and at the time of injection into solar wind but not on diffusion. Hence, it is necessary to automatically separate the CR stations with strong narrow pulses and exclude them from diffusion analysis. We strive to make this automatic using a program of image identification in the frame of MATLAB.",

         "abstract": "Observations made with the two Voyager spacecraft confirmed that the solar wind decelerates to form the heliospheric termination shock and that it has begun its merger with the local interstellar medium. The compression ratio of this shock affects galactic cosmic rays when they enter the heliosphere. Hydrodynamic (HD) models show that the compression ratio can have a significant latitude dependence; with the largest value in the nose direction of the heliosphere, becoming significantly less towards the polar regions. The modulation effects of such large latitude dependence are studied, using a well-established numerical drift and shock modulation model. We focus on computing the modulated spectra for galactic protons with emphasis on the radial and polar gradients in the equatorial plane and at a polar angle of \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, corresponding to the heliolatitude of Voyager 1. Two sets of solutions are computed and compared each time; with and without a latitude dependence for the compression ratio. All computations are done for the two magnetic field polarity cycles assuming solar minimum conditions. Including the termination shock in the model allows the study of the re-acceleration of galactic protons in the outer heliosphere. We find that for the A &lt; 0 polarity cycle the intensity between \u223c200 MeV and \u223c1 GeV in the vicinity of the shock in the heliospheric equatorial plane may exceed the local interstellar value specified at the heliopause. Unfortunately, at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, the effect is reduced. This seems not possible during an A &gt; 0 cycle because significant modulation is then predicted between the heliopause and the termination shock, depending on how strong global gradient and curvature drifts are in the heliosheath. The overall effect of the shock on galactic protons in the equatorial plane is to reduce the total modulation as a function of radial distance with respect to the interstellar spectrum. Making the compression ratio latitude dependent enhances these effects at energies E &lt; 200 MeV in the equatorial plane. At larger heliolatitudes these effects are even more significant. The differences in the modulation between the two drift cycles are compelling when the compression ratio is made latitude dependent but at Earth this effect is insignificant. A general result is that the computed radial gradient changes for galactic protons at and close to the TS and that these changes are polarity dependent. In line with previous work, large polarity dependent effects are predicted for the inner heliosphere and also close to the shock\u2019s position in the equatorial plane. In contrast, at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, the largest polarity effect occurs in the middle heliosphere (50 AU), enhanced by the latitude dependence of the compression ratio. At this latitude, the amount of proton modulation between the heliopause and the termination shock is much reduced. If galactic cosmic rays were to experience some diffusive shock acceleration over the 100-1000 MeV range at the shock, the radial gradient should change its sign in the vicinity of the shock, how large, depends on the compression ratio and the amount of drifts taking place in the outer heliosphere. The effective polar gradient shows a strong polarity dependence at Earth but this dissipates at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, especially with increasing radial distance. This tendency is enhanced by making the compression ratio latitude dependent.",

         "abstract": "Substorm onset timing is a critical issue in magnetotail dynamics research. Solar wind energy is accumulated in the magnetosphere and the configuration of the magnetosphere evolves toward an unstable state during the growth phase. At some point, the expansion phase begins and the stored energy is released through a variety of processes that return the magnetosphere to a lower energy state. In recovery the various processes die away. Unfortunately, the ground and magnetospheric signatures of onset, i.e. energy release, can be seen both in the growth phase prior to onset and in the expansion phase after onset. Some investigators refer to each of these events as a substorm. Tail observations suggest that most substorms have one event that differentiates the behavior of the tail field and plasma. We refer to this time as the \"main substorm onset\". Each substorm associated phenomenon is timed independently and then compared with main substorm onsets. ISEE-2 tail observations are used to examine the tail lobe magnetic conditions associated with substorms because ISEE-2 orbit has a high inclination and frequently observes lobe field. Approximately 70 \u223c 75% of tail lobe B<SUB>t</SUB> and B<SUB>z</SUB> change are associated with the main substorm onset. If the satellite is more than 3 Re above (below) the neutral sheet, 86% (57%) of plasma pressure dropouts are associated with substorms. We interpret our results as evidence that the effect of the growth phase is to drive the magnetosphere towards instability. As it approaches global instability local regions become temporarily unstable but are rapidly quenched. Eventually one of these events develops into the global instability that releases most of the stored energy and returns the magnetosphere to a more stable configuration.",

         "abstract": "Recently, Javaraiah (2012a) analyzed the combined Greenwich and Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) sunspot group data during the period 1874-2011 and studied variations in the annual numbers (counts) of the small (maximum area A&lt;100 millionth of solar hemisphere, msh), large (100\u2a7dA&lt;300msh), and big (A\u2a7e300msh) sunspot groups. Here that analysis is extended and studied variations in the mean maximum sizes (the mean values of maximum areas) of the aforementioned three classes of sunspot groups and also their combination. It is found that there is no significant correlation between the mean maximum size of any class of sunspot groups and the International Sunspot Number (R), probably due to in a given time interval small sunspot groups/sunspots outnumber the large ones. A pattern of an approximate 9-year period cycle is seen in the variations of the mean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups during a solar cycle. On long-time scales it is found that there exists a strong 130 or more years cycle in the variation of the mean size of the small sunspot groups, whereas there is a hint on the existence of \u224844-year cycles in the variations of the mean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups. During the decline phase of cycle 23, there was a scarcity in the sunspot groups whose A\u2a7d37msh, which may be related to the slow growth of sunspot groups during this period. During the minimum between cycles 23 and 24 may be due to the presence of a number of small sunspot groups whose A&gt;37 was larger than that of whose A\u2a7d37, the relatively large size coronal holes were present at low-latitudes and the total solar irradiance was very low.",

         "abstract": "Observations of galactic Carbon in the heliosphere provide a useful tool with which a comprehensive description of the global modulation of cosmic rays both inside and outside off the solar wind termination shock (TS) can be made. This is, in part, because galactic Carbon is not contaminated by anomalous cosmic rays as is the case for oxygen, helium and hydrogen. However, this kind of study requires that there should be reasonable compatibility of model solutions to spacecraft and earthbound observations. In this study, the well-established two-dimensional model that contains a TS, a heliosheath, as well as shock re-acceleration of galactic cosmic rays and particle drifts, is used first to study modulation from solar minimum to moderate maximum activity at Earth. This model can handle any global heliospheric geometry of both the TS and heliopause (HP) positions. Second, the model is applied to study the contribution of drifts and the enhancement of polar perpendicular diffusion in the heliosheath to the total modulation in the heliosphere as a function of energy for both polarity cycles of the magnetic field during solar minimum conditions. This modeling is done with a new heliopause spectrum (HPS, usually referred to as the local interstellar spectrum) at kinetic energy E &lt; \u223c200 MeV/nuc. This HPS is derived from observations made by the Voyager 1 spacecraft of galactic Carbon at a radial distance of \u223c122 AU from the Sun. We find that: (1) The model gives realistic modulation for both magnetic polarity cycles of the Sun, from Earth to beyond the TS, and that the level of modulation at Earth between the recent solar minimum and the previous moderate maximum condition exceed that between the HP and Earth in the recent solar minimum. (2) Neglecting drifts in the heliosheath along the Voyager heliolatitude is a reasonable assumption, but in the equatorial plane of the heliosphere drifts are important for heliosheath modulation in the A &lt; 0 polarity cycle, especially when galactic particles are re-accelerated at the TS. (3) The contribution of the enhancement of the polar perpendicular diffusion in the heliosheath to the total modulation seems insignificant. (4) The new HPS as observed by Voyager 1 at E &lt; \u223c200 MeV/nuc is found to be significantly higher than previous estimates, for example, at E = 100 MeV/nuc by a factor of \u223c2. We find that the total modulation between the HP and Earth at 10 MeV/nuc causes the intensity at Earth to be only \u223c4.5% of the HPS, whereas for 100 MeV/nuc it is \u223c17.5%. Respectively, this means that the global radial gradient for galactic Carbon for this period was \u223c2.5%/AU and \u223c1.4%/AU, if the heliopause is taken at 122 AU.",

In the previous paper (Morozova et al., 2017) we mainly discussed the first mode of principal component analysis of tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature and pressure fields, which was shown to be correlated with lower stratospheric ozone and anti-correlated with cosmic ray flux. Now we extend the investigation to the second mode, which suggests a coupling between the stratosphere and the ionosphere. <P />This second mode, located in the low and middle stratosphere (and explaining ~7% of temperature and ~3% of geopotential height variations), showed to be statistically significantly correlated with variations of the middle stratosphere ozone content and anti-correlated with variations of ionospheric total electron content. Similar co-variability of these stratospheric and ionospheric parameters was also obtained with the wavelet cross-coherence analysis. <P />To investigate the role of atmospheric circulation dynamics and the causal nature of the found correlations, we applied the convergent cross mapping (CCM) analysis to our series. Strong evidence for the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling were obtained for the winter 2012-2013 that is characterized by the easterly QBO phase (quasi-biennial oscillations of the direction of the stratospheric zonal winds) and a strong SSW (sudden stratospheric warming event). Further analysis (for the three-year time interval 2012-2015) hint that SSWs events play main role in emphasizing the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

         "abstract": "Periodicity in occurrence of magnetic disturbances in polar cap and auroral zone under conditions of steady and powerful solar wind influence on the magnetosphere is analyzed on the example of 9 storm events with distinctly expressed sawtooth substorms (N = 48). Relationships between the polar cap magnetic activity (PC-index), magnetic disturbances in the auroral zone (AL-index) and value of the ring current asymmetry (ASYM index) were examined within the intervals of the PC growth phase and the PC decline phase inherent to each substorm. It is shown that the substorm sudden onsets are always preceded by the PC growth and that the substorm development does not affect the PC growth rate. On achieving the disturbance maximum, the PC and AL indices are simultaneously fall down to the level preceding the substorm, so that the higher the substorm intensity, the larger is the AL and PC drop in the decline phase. The ASYM index increases and decreases in conformity with the PC and AL behavior, the correlation between ASYM and PC being better than between ASYM and AL. Level of the solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere determines periodicity and intensity of disturbances: the higher the coupling function E<SUB>KL</SUB>, the higher is substorm intensity and shorter is substorm length. Taking into account the permanently high level of auroral activity and inconsistency of aurora behavior and magnetic onsets during sawtooth substorms, the conclusion is made that auroral ionosphere conductivity is typically high and ensures an extremely high intensity of field-aligned currents in R1 FAC system. The periodicity of sawtooth substorms is determined by recurrent depletions and restorations of R1 currents, which are responsible for coordinated variations of magnetic activity in the polar cap and auroral zone.",

It was obtained that the longitudinal patterns of the EMA and zonal wind show the surprising similarity with the EPB distributions (R \u2245 0.8, R \u2245 0.72). On the other hand, the resemblance with the ionosphere characteristics (EIA, PRE) is rather faint (R \u2245 0.37, R \u2245 0.12). It was shown that the thermosphere zonal winds are the most possible transfer mediator of the troposphere DE3 tide influence. The most successful moment for the transfer of the troposphere DE3 tide energy takes place in the beginning of the EPB production, namely, during the seed perturbation development.",

         "abstract": "Understanding the thermosphere and ionosphere conditions is crucial for spacecraft operations and many applications using radio signal transmission (e.g. in communication and navigation). In this sense, physics based modelling plays an important role, since it can adequately reproduce the complex coupling mechanisms in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system. The accuracy of the physics based model results does not only depend on the appropriate implementation of the physical processes, but also on the quality of the input data (forcing). In this study, we analyze the impact of input data uncertainties on the model results. We use the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere electrodynamics model (CTIPe), which requires satellite based solar wind, interplanetary field and hemispheric power data from ACE and TIROS/NOAA missions. To identify the impact of the forcing uncertainties, two model runs are compared against each other. The first run uses the input data that were available in real-time (operational) and the second run uses the best estimate obtained in post-processing (research or historical run). The analysis is performed in a case study on the 20th November 2003 extreme geomagnetic storm, that caused significant perturbations in the MIT system. This paper validates the thermosphere and ionosphere response to this storm over Europe comparing both CTIPe model runs with measurements of Total Electron Content (TEC) and thermosphere neutral density. In general, CTIPe results show a good agreement with measurements. However, the deviations between the model and observations are larger in the ionosphere than in the thermosphere. The comparison of the two model runs reveals that the deviations between model results and measurements are larger for the operational run than the research run. It is evident for the storm analyzed here, that data gaps in the input data are impacting considerably the model performance. The consistency between simulation and measurements allows the interpretation of the physical mechanisms behind the ionosphere perturbations and the changes in neutral composition during this event. Joule heating in the Auroral region, generating meridional winds and large scale surges, is suggested to be the main driver of the positive ionospheric storm over central Europe. In the polar cap and Auroral region, convection processes dominate the thermosphere-ionosphere conditions. This study does not only illustrate the importance of working with a good estimate of the model forcing, but also indicates the necessity of using measurements and models, to get a better understanding of the most likely responsible processes for the observed storm effects.",

For the same period, three different atmospheric models show over-estimation of temperature (\u223c10 K) near the stratopause and in the upper mesosphere, and a signature of under-estimation is seen above mesopause when compared against SABER measured temperature profiles. Estimation of monthly temperature anomalies reveals a semiannual and ter-annual oscillation moving downward from the mesosphere to the stratosphere during January to December. Moreover, Lomb Scargle periodogram (LSP) and Wavelet transform techniques are employed to characterize the semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations to diagnose the wave dynamics in the stratosphere-mesosphere system. Results suggested that semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations are exist in stratosphere, whereas, semi-annual and annual oscillations are observed in mesosphere. In lower mesosphere, LSP analyses revealed conspicuous absence of annual oscillations in altitude range of \u223c55-65 km, and semi-annual oscillations are not existing in 35-45 km. Four monthly oscillations are also reported in the altitude range of about 45-65 km. The temporal localization of oscillations using wavelet analysis shows strong annual oscillation during year 2004-2006 and 2009-2011.",

An interpretation is made of both the measured crossings of the magnetosheath boundaries and the behavior of the registered plasma parameters. In our case, it is the value of the ion flux along the spacecraft trajectory. The magnetosheath-magnetosphere model, developed at the Institute of Mechanics, Sofia, Bulgaria, is used as a theoretical basis. It describes the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere in a simplified gas-dynamic approximation. A characteristic feature of the model is that it allows for the self-consistent description of the magnetosheath boundaries - the bow shock (BS) and the magnetopause (MP). The three-dimensional picture of the magnetosheath fluid flow is also obtained as part of the solution. The magnetosheath characteristics thus obtained are in correspondence with a given momentary state of the interplanetary medium, defined on the basis of WIND satellite data (appropriately shifted by time). The results are discussed in the context of advantages and limitations of using the gas-dynamic model for the interpretation of magnetosheath plasma measurements in the near-magnetopause magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "The electron density of the topside ionosphere and the plasmasphere contributes essentially to the overall Total Electron Content (TEC) budget affecting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals. The plasmasphere can cause half or even more of the GNSS range error budget due to ionospheric propagation errors. This paper presents a comparative study of different plasmasphere and topside ionosphere data aiming at establishing an appropriate database for plasmasphere modelling. We analyze electron density profiles along the geomagnetic field lines derived from the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite/Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) records of remote plasma sounding with radio waves. We compare these RPI profiles with 2D reconstructions of the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere electron density derived from GNSS based TEC measurements onboard the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite. Most of the coincidences between IMAGE profiles and CHAMP reconstructions are detected in the region with L-shell between 2 and 5. In general the CHAMP reconstructed electron densities are below the IMAGE profile densities, with median of the CHAMP minus IMAGE residuals around -588 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Additionally, a comparison is made with electron densities derived from passive radio wave RPI measurements onboard the IMAGE satellite. Over the available 2001-2005 period of IMAGE measurements, the considered combined data from the active and passive RPI operations cover the region within a latitude range of \u00b160\u00b0N, all longitudes, and an L-shell ranging from 1.2 to 15. In the coincidence regions (mainly 2 \u2a7d L \u2a7d 4), we check the agreement between available active and passive RPI data. The comparison shows that the measurements are well correlated, with a median residual of \u223c52 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The RMS and STD values of the relative residuals are around 22% and 21% respectively. In summary, the results encourage the application of IMAGE RPI data for plasmasphere and plasmapause modeling.",

This is a first article on real time application of numerical methods to obtain the parameters of traveling ionosphere disturbances (TIDs) using vertical incident ionograms. In this paper, the distribution of ionosphere electron density with TIDs is constructed using a background ionosphere model superimposed a perturbation theory model. The background ionosphere electron density is modelled by the inversion of vertical incident ionograms which are observed before the appearance of the disturbance. Based on the fourth order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (the so-called ABM) predictor corrector method, instead of Runge-Kutta method, the fast digital ray tracing method is established. According to process of the disturbed trace simulation and parameters inversion, the characteristic parameters of ionosphere disturbance at different detection time can be obtained in real time. The numerical analysis of TIDs is then captured completely.",

         "abstract": "Presently, the ionosphere effect is the main source of the error in the Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. This effect can largely be removed by using the two-frequency measurements, while to obtain the reasonable results in the single-frequency applications, an accurate ionosphere model is required. Since the global ionosphere models do not meet our needs everywhere, the local ionosphere models are developed. In this paper, a rapid local ionosphere model over Iran is presented. For this purpose, the GPS observations obtained from 40 GPS stations of the Iranian Permanent GPS Network (IPGN) and 16 other GPS stations around Iran have been used. The observations have been selected under 2014 solar maximum, from the days 058, 107, 188 and 271 of the year 2014 with different geomagnetic activities. Moreover, ionospheric observables based on the precise point positioning (PPP) have been applied to model the ionosphere. To represent our ionosphere model, the B-spline basis functions have been employed and the variance component estimation (VCE) method has been used to regularize the problem. <P />To show the efficiency our PPP-derived local ionosphere model with respect to the International GNSS Service (IGS) global models, these models are applied on the single point positioning using single-frequency observations and their results are compared with the precise coordinates obtained from the double-differenced solution using dual-frequency observations. The results show that the 95th percentile of horizontal and vertical positioning errors of the single-frequency point positioning are about 3.1 and 13.6 m, respectively, when any ionosphere model are not applied. These values significantly improve when the ionosphere models are applied in the solutions. Applying CODE's Rapid Global ionosphere map (CORG), improvements of 59% and 81% in horizontal and vertical components are observed. These values for the IGS Global ionosphere map (IGSG) are 70% and 82%, respectively. The best results are obtained from our local ionosphere model, where 84% and 87% improvements in horizontal and vertical components are observed. These results confirm the efficiency of our local ionosphere model over Iran with respect to the global models. As a by-product, the Differential Code Biases (DCBs) of the receivers are also estimated. In this line, we found that the intra-day variations of the receiver DCBs could be significant. Therefore, these variations must be taken into account for the precise ionosphere modeling.",

The model-assisted technology for estimate of the upper boundary of the ionosphere, hup, from the slab thickness components in the bottomside and topside ionosphere - eliminating the plasmasphere contribution of \u03c4 - is applied at latitudes 35\u00b0 to 70\u00b0N and longitudes -10\u00b0 to 40\u00b0E, from the data of 20 observatories of GPS-TEC and ionosonde networks, for selected days and hours of October and November 2003. The daily-hourly values of NmF2, hmF2 and TECgps are used as the constrained parameters for the International Reference Ionosphere extended to the plasmasphere, IRI-Plas, during the ionospheric quiet days, positive and negative storm phases for estimate of \u03c4 and hup. Good correlation has been found between the slab thickness and the upper boundary of the ionosphere for the intense ionospheric storms at October-November 2003.

In addition to this significant quiet-time variability, space weather events cause severe perturbations of the upper atmosphere through solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding on global characteristics of the thermosphere-ionosphere system are of vital importance to develop efficient models to meet the accuracy requirements of satellite-based communication and navigation applications. Further, the current 24th solar cycle is associated with several unique features, such as the deep and prolonged minimum, and the lowest maximum of the past hundred years, which triggered an increased interest to understand the upper atmospheric variability under such extreme and peculiar conditions.",

         "abstract": "The aurora shows explosive activities a few times in 24 hours on a moderately active day. This specific phenomenon is called the auroral substorm, which consists of the growth, expansion and recovery phases; the explosive activities occur during the expansion phase. As an introduction, the explosive activities of the aurora are morphologically described first on the basis of ground-based all-sky and satellite images. In terms of theoretical understanding, the processes for the explosive activities have been considered almost exclusively in terms of \u201cthe magnetic field line approach\u201d in the past, including the process of magnetic reconnection. Instead, in this paper, we consider the processes in terms of \u201cthe electric current line approach\u201d. This approach requires that the whole process of auroral substorms should be considered as a chain of processes, which consists of power supply (dynamo), transmission (currents/circuits) and dissipation (auroral substorms). An increased power of the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo (\u2248 5x1018 erg/s or 1011w) intensifies the electric currents mainly in the main body (just outside of the ring current) of the magnetosphere, resulting in accumulating energy in its inductive circuit and inflation of the magnetosphere. When the accumulated energy reaches about 5x1022 ergs (5x1015 J), the magnetosphere tends to become unstable (because of current instabilities). As the current intensity is reduced as a result, the magnetosphere is deflated. It is suggested that it is in this deflation process, during which the accumulated energy is unloaded, and an earthward electric field (5-50 mV/m) is produced on the equatorial plane, establishing the current system (the UL current system), which is responsible for the expansion phase, including the most characteristic features of the expansion phase, such as the poleward advance of the aurora and the development of the auroral electrojet. The electric current approach is rather new and needs much more effort to develop.",

         "abstract": "The response times of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system are, on average, greater than the autocorrelation timescales of solar wind forcing. This means that the system is rarely, if ever, in equilibrium. Departures from equilibrium are a key component of the Expanding-Contracting Polar Cap (ECPC) model of convection excitation in both the magnetosphere and ionosphere, driven by the Dungey reconnection cycle of opening and re-closing magnetospheric field lines. Averaging over sufficiently long timescales reduces data to the equivalent of steady-state conditions, which hides the physical mechanisms involved and allows us to map electric fields from interplanetary space to the ionosphere\u2013but this is not valid, either physically or generally, because of magnetic induction effects. Only for transient phenomena on sufficiently short timescales do the mechanisms associated with non-equilibrium fully manifest themselves. Nevertheless, because of both ever-changing solar wind conditions and Earth's dipole tilt, eccentricity and rotation, the magnetosphere is always tending towards a perpetually-evolving equilibrium configuration and there are important implications of transient events for understanding the general behavior of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system and its response to solar wind forcing. We here discuss one example: as a consequence of the importance of departures from equilibrium inherent in the ECPC model, the solar wind dynamic pressure PSW influences the magnetosphere-ionosphere convection response to the generation of open field lines by reconnection in the dayside subsolar magnetopause. We here demonstrate this effect in a statistical survey of observations and show that it is as predicted by the ECPC model and that, through it, PSW has an influence on flux transport in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

         "abstract": "The solar wind has been seen as the major source of hot magnetospheric plasma since the early 1960's. More recent theoretical and observational studies have shown that the cold (few eV) polar wind and warmer polar cusp plasma that flow continuously upward from the ionosphere can be a very significant source of ions in the magnetosphere and can become accelerated to the energies characteristic of the plasma sheet, ring current, and warm plasma cloak. Previous studies have also shown the presence of solar wind ions in these magnetospheric regions. These studies are based principally on proxy measurements of the ratios of He++/H+ and the high charge states of O+/H+. The resultant admixture of ionospheric and solar wind ions that results has been difficult to quantify, since the dominant H+ ions originating in the ionosphere and solar wind are indistinguishable. The ionospheric ions are already inside the magnetosphere and are filling it from the inside out with direct access from the ionosphere to the center of the magnetotail. The solar wind ions on the other hand must gain access through the outer boundaries of the magnetosphere, filling the magnetosphere from the outside in. These solar wind particles must then diffuse or drift from the flanks of the magnetosphere to the near-midnight reconnection region of the tail which takes more time to reach (hours) than the continuously large outflowing ionospheric polar wind (10's of minutes). In this paper we examine the magnetospheric filling using the trajectories of the different ion sources to unravel the intermixing process rather than trying to interpret only the proxy ratios. We compare the timing of the access of the ionospheric and solar wind sources and we use new merged ionosphere-magnetosphere multi-fluid MHD modeling to separate and compare the ionospheric and solar wind H+ source strengths. The rapid access of the cold polar wind and warm polar cusp ions flowing down-tail in the lobes into the mid-plane of the magnetotail, suggests thatm, coupled with a southward turning of the IMF Bz, these ions can play a key triggering role in the onset of substorms and larger storms.",

         "abstract": "The plasmapause marks the limit of the plasmasphere and is characterized by a sudden change in plasma density. This can influence the other regions of the magnetosphere, including due to different waves circulating inside and outside the plasmasphere. In the present work, we first compare the positions of the plasmapause measured by the NASA Van Allen Probes in 2015 with those of the SWIFF plasmasphere model (SPM). Using the Van Allen Probes and other satellite observations like PROBA-V, we investigate the links that can exist with the radiation belt boundaries. The inward motion of the outer radiation belt associated with sudden flux enhancements of energetic electrons can indeed be directly related to the plasmapause erosion during geomagnetic storms, suggesting possible links. Moreover, the position of the plasmapause projected in the ionosphere is compared with the ionospheric convection boundary. The equatorward motion of the plasmapause projected in the ionosphere is related to the equatorward edge motion of the auroral oval that goes to lower latitudes during storms due to the geomagnetic perturbation, like the low altitude plasmapause and the outer radiation belt. The links between these different regions are investigated during quiet periods, for which the plasmasphere is widely extended, as well as during geomagnetic storms for which plumes are generated, and then afterwards rotates with the plasmasphere. The magnetic local time dependence of these boundaries is especially studied on 14 March 2014 after a sudden northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and for the geomagnetic storm of 26 August 2018, showing the importance of the magnetic field topology and of the convection electric field in the interactions between these different regions eventually leading to the coupling between magnetosphere and ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Mesoscale (on the scales of a few minutes and a few RE) magnetosheath and magnetopause perturbations driven by foreshock transients have been observed in the flank magnetotail. In this paper, we present the 3D global hybrid simulation results to show qualitatively the 3D structure of the flank magnetopause distortion caused by foreshock transients and its impacts on the tail magnetosphere and the ionosphere. Foreshock transient perturbations consist of a low-density core and high-density edge(s), thus, after they propagate into the magnetosheath, they result in magnetosheath pressure perturbations that distort magnetopause. The magnetopause is distorted locally outward (inward) in response to the dip (peak) of the magnetosheath pressure perturbations. As the magnetosheath perturbations propagate tailward, they continue to distort the flank magnetopause. This qualitative explains the transient appearance of the magnetosphere observed in the flank magnetosheath associated with foreshock transients. The 3D structure of the magnetosheath perturbations and the shape of the distorted magnetopause keep evolving as they propagate tailward. The transient distortion of the magnetopause generates compressional magnetic field perturbations within the magnetosphere. The magnetopause distortion also alters currents around the magnetopause, generating field-aligned currents (FACs) flowing in and out of the ionosphere. As the magnetopause distortion propagates tailward, it results in localized enhancements of FACs in the ionosphere that propagate anti-sunward. This qualitatively explains the observed anti-sunward propagation of the ground magnetic field perturbations associated with foreshock transients.",

         "abstract": "The Sun's connection with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere is carried out through the exchange of electromagnetic and mass flux and is regulated by a complex interconnection of processes. During space weather events, solar flares or fast streams of solar atmosphere strongly disturb the Earth's environment. Often the electric currents that connect the different parts of the Sun-Earth system become unstable and explosively release the stored electromagnetic energy in one of the more dramatic expressions of space weather - the auroral storm and substorm. Some aspects of the magnetosphere-ionosphere connection that generates auroral arcs during space weather events are well-known. However, several fundamental problems remain unsolved because of the lack of unambiguous identification of the magnetic field connection between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The correct mapping between different regions of the magnetosphere and their foot-points in the ionosphere, coupled with appropriate distributed measurements of plasma and fields in focused regions of the magnetosphere, is necessary to establish unambiguously that a given magnetospheric process is the generator of an observed arc. The three most important problems for which the correct magnetic field mapping would provide closure to are the substorm growth phase arcs, the expansion phase onset arcs and the system of arcs that emerge from the magnetosphere-ionosphere connection during the development of the early substorm expansion phase phenomenon known as substorm current wedge (SCW). Energetic electron beams, used as magnetic field tracers, can enable the closure needed. However, the application of beams as tracers require demonstration that the beams can be injected into the loss cone, that the spacecraft potentials induced by the beam emission are manageable, and that sufficient electron flux reaches the atmosphere to be detectable by optical or radio means after the beam has propagated thousands of kilometers under competing effects of beam spread and constriction as well as effects of beam-induced instabilities. In this communication we provide a review of the latest results of synergistic research carried out under the NSF INSPIRE program to address these challenges and discuss the next steps toward the realization of active experiments in space using relativistic electron beams.",

         "abstract": "Precipitable water vapor (PWV) and ionospheric vertical total electron content (VTEC) are two essential components of space-atmosphere parameters. The zenith troposphere delay can be converted into PWV, which plays a crucial role in meteorological studies. In the meantime, the importance of the VTEC lies in providing ionospheric corrections for single-frequency (SF) positioning, navigation, and timing users. Currently, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has become one of the most commonly used tools for retrieving PWV and VTEC and normally relies on dual-frequency, geodetic-grade receivers and antennas. However, this reliance also implies high hardware costs. In this paper, we propose a single-frequency ionosphere and troposphere retrieval approach that enables the simultaneous retrieval of PWV and VTEC from multi-GNSS data collected by low-cost SF receivers. The use of SF receivers can greatly reduce the cost of hardware. Furthermore, the simultaneous provision of PWV and VTEC also has a positive effect on studying the coupling mechanisms of the ionosphere and troposphere. The accuracy of the estimated zenith troposphere delay can be better than 10 mm compared with the troposphere products published by the International GNSS Service, and the PWV is no more than 3 mm compared with radiosonde-derived results. Referring to the final International GNSS Service global ionosphere map products and the Jason altimeter data, the VTEC retrieved from the single-frequency ionosphere and troposphere retrieval method can perform at roughly equal levels compared to the customary dual-frequency method.",
