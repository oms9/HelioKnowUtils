         "abstract": "In this work, we evaluated the quasi-realistic ionosphere forecasting capability by an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as the background model in the system. The slant total electron contents (TECs) from global International Global Navigation Satellite Systems Service ground-based receivers and from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate are assimilated into the system, and the ionosphere is then predicted in advance during the quiet interval of 23 to 27 March 2010. The predicted ionosphere vertical TEC (VTEC) and the critical frequency foF<SUB>2</SUB> are validated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology VTEC and global ionosondes network, respectively. We found that the ionosphere forecast quality could be enhanced by optimizing the thermospheric neutral components via the EnKF method. The ionosphere electron density forecast accuracy can be improved by at least 10% for 24 hr. Furthermore, the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics/Global Ultraviolet Imager (TIMED/GUVI) [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] observations are used to validate the predicted thermosphere [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>]. The validation shows that the [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] optimized by EnKF has better agreement with the TIMED/GUVI observation. This study further demonstrates the validity of EnKF in enhancing the ionospheric forecast capability in addition to our previous observing system simulation experiments by He et al.

         "abstract": "The temporal change in height of a specific electron density can be used as a proxy for vertical plasma drift (PVPD) at the magnetic equator. The use of PVPDs as a predictor of low-latitude ionospheric scintillation during the subsequent evening has previously been shown to have forecasting skill when using ionosonde data. The implementation of this approach using a physics-based model is proposed to provide greater forecast antecedence without the need for local ionosondes. For the first time, the physics-based model PVPD method is compared to another forecasting approach that uses a physics-based model to calculate Rayleigh-Taylor growth rates (RTGRs). In equinoctial test cases considered, when appropriate scintillation observation thresholds are selected, PVPD forecasting is shown to have skill similar to or better than the RTGR method using the same physics-based model. PVPD forecasting requires only electron densities and corresponding altitudes. Therefore, this approach could be applied using an ionospheric data assimilation model whereas the majority of these models do not provide output for all variables required for RTGR forecasting. The forecasting skill in these test cases, the simplicity of physics-based PVPD forecasting, and the suitability of this method for use of ionospheric data assimilation model output make this method attractive as a forecasting tool in an operational setting if skill can be further demonstrated for a wide range of conditions. However, both PVPD and RTGR forecasting skill are shown to be limited during solstitial months with high scintillation activity. This may be improved by using a data assimilation model.",

         "abstract": "The capability to forecast conditions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere is investigated based on 30-day hindcast experiments that were initialized bimonthly during 2009 and 2010. The hindcasts were performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. Analysis of the WACCMX+DART hindcasts reveals several important features that are relevant to forecasting the middle atmosphere. The results show a clear dependence on spatial scale, with the slowest error growth occurring in the zonal mean and the fastest error growth occurring for small-scale waves. The error growth rate is also found to be significantly greater in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere compared to in the upper stratosphere to lower mesosphere, suggesting that the forecast skill decreases with increasing altitude. The results demonstrate that the errors in the lower thermosphere reach saturation, on average, in less than 5 days, at least with the current version of WACCMX+DART. A seasonal dependency to the error growth is found at high latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres but not in the tropics or global average. We additionally investigate the error growth rates for migrating and nonmigrating atmospheric tides and find that the errors saturate after \u223c5 days for tides in the lower thermosphere. The results provide an initial assessment of the error growth rates in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere and are relevant for understanding how whole atmosphere models can potentially improve space weather forecasting.",

         "abstract": "Accurate specification of the thermosphere states is crucial to the low Earth orbit satellite operation. In this work, the impact of different ionosphere and thermosphere observing systems on the improvement of neutral temperature of the data assimilation model has been investigated by a series of observing system simulation experiments. The selected observations include the Global Navigation Satellite System total electron content (e.g., MIT vertical total electron content [VTEC]) and the daytime Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) level-2 disk temperature (T<SUB>disk</SUB>). Such observations are ingested into the coupled ionosphere and thermosphere model based on our developed ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation systems on the basis of the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. The main findings are as follows: (a) A considerable improvement of the neutral temperature estimation of the physical-based model can be obtained in the global region by assimilating either the MIT VTEC or the GOLD T<SUB>disk</SUB> observations; (b) the assimilation of the GOLD can further contribute to temperature improvement in the lower thermosphere (&lt;200 km), relative to the MIT VTEC assimilation; and (c) simultaneously assimilating both observation types can better improve the quality of neutral temperature estimation over the global area during the whole data assimilation process. The current results demonstrate that assimilating GOLD observations is important to improve the forecast capability of the physical-based model for the lower thermosphere states and can provide a possible reference for the joint assimilation of the ionosphere and thermosphere observations to better thermosphere specification.",

         "abstract": "Accurate ionospheric specification for the current and future is one of the key tasks in operational space weather. In this work, we have assessed the effect of a dense ground network consisting of different radio instruments either developed or under developing on ionosphere nowcasting and forecasting over China and adjacent region (0-60\u00b0N and 70-140\u00b0E) through observing system simulation experiments. The data assimilation system is an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as a background model. Effects of different observation types, including the slant total electron content from Beidou System geostationary satellite and Global Position System and electron density observations from ionosondes and incoherent scattering radar on the ionospheric nowcasting and forecasting, are examined by the accurate specification of ionosphere key parameters (total electron content and 3-D electron density). We found that simultaneously assimilating different observation types can greatly improve the quality of ionosphere specification. Furthermore, updating the thermospheric state variables in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere forecast model in the assimilation step plays an important role in improving the ionosphere forecasting. The ionosphere forecasting capability can last longer (&gt;24 hr) in each observing system simulation experiment due to the adjusted thermosphere states. This study can provide a reference for observing system design over the China region and future ionosphere forecasting operation.",

         "abstract": "&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Abstract Ionospheric day-to-day variability is a ubiquitous feature, even in the absence of appreciable geomagnetic activities. Although meteorological perturbations have been recognized as an important source of the variability, it is not well represented in previous modeling studies and the mechanism is not well understood. This study demonstrates that the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) constrained in the stratosphere and mesosphere by the hourly whole atmosphere community climate model (WACCM) simulations is capable of reproducing observed features of day-to-day variability in the thermosphere-ionosphere. Realistic weather patterns in the lower atmosphere in WACCM were specified by Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis for Research and Application (MERRA). The day-to-day variations in mean zonal wind, migrating and nonmigrating tides in the thermosphere, vertical and zonal E \u00d7 B drifts, and ionosphere F2 layer peak electron density (NmF2) are examined. The standard deviations of the drifts and NmF2 show local time and longitudinal dependence that compare favorably with observations. Their magnitudes are 50% or more of those from observations. The day-to-day thermosphere and ionosphere variability in the model is primarily caused by the perturbations originated in lower atmosphere, since the model simulation is under constant solar minimum and low geomagnetic conditions.",

Due to their high vertical resolution and global coverage, RO data are well suited to describe the full 3-dimensional ENSO structure in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. We find that interannual temperature anomalies in the equatorial region show a natural decomposition into zonal-mean and eddy (deviations from the zonal-mean) components that are both related to ENSO. Consistent with previous studies, we find that during the warm phase of ENSO, zonal-mean temperatures increase in the tropical troposphere and decrease in the tropical stratosphere. Maximum warming occurs above 8 km, and the transition between warming and cooling occurs near the tropopause. This zonal-mean response lags sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific by 3 months. The atmospheric eddy component, in contrast, responds rapidly (within 1 month) to ENSO forcing. This signal features a low-latitude dipole between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with off-equatorial maxima centered around 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 latitude in both hemispheres. The eddy response pattern attains maximum amplitude in the upper troposphere near 11 km and (with opposite polarity) in a shallow layer near the tropopause at approximately 17 km. The eddy ENSO signal tends to be out-of-phase between low and middle latitudes in both the troposphere and lower stratosphere.",

         "abstract": "In early 2014, continuous monitoring with the Hisaki satellite discovered transient auroral emission at Jupiter during a period when the solar wind was relatively quiet for a few days. Simultaneous imaging made by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) suggested that the transient aurora is associated with a global magnetospheric disturbance that spans from the inner to outer magnetosphere. However, the temporal and spatial evolutions of the magnetospheric disturbance were not resolved because of the lack of continuous monitoring of the transient aurora simultaneously with the imaging. Here we report the coordinated observation of the aurora and plasma torus made by Hisaki and HST during the approach phase of the Juno spacecraft in mid-2016. On day 142, Hisaki detected a transient aurora with a maximum total H<SUB>2</SUB> emission power of 8.5 TW. The simultaneous HST imaging was indicative of a large \"dawn storm,\" which is associated with tail reconnection, at the onset of the transient aurora. The outer emission, which is associated with hot plasma injection in the inner magnetosphere, followed the dawn storm within less than two Jupiter rotations. The monitoring of the torus with Hisaki indicated that the hot plasma population increased in the torus during the transient aurora. These results imply that the magnetospheric disturbance is initiated via the tail reconnection and rapidly expands toward the inner magnetosphere, followed by the hot plasma injection reaching the plasma torus. This corresponds to the radially inward transport of the plasma and/or energy from the outer to the inner magnetosphere.",

Of 23 flux ropes detected in current sheets in the near-Mars (\u223c1-3 Martian radii downstream) magnetotail, only 3 (possibly 4) can be explained by the magnetotail reconnection scenario, while the vast majority of the events (19 events) are more consistent with flux ropes that are originally generated in the dayside ionosphere and subsequently transported into the nightside magnetotail. The mixed origins of the detected flux ropes imply complex nature of generation and transport of Martian magnetotail flux ropes.",

This approach has the potential to transform research and operations in snow-dominated regions, but sources of uncertainty need quantification. We compared relative uncertainty contributions from lidar depth measurement and density modeling to SWE estimation, utilizing lidar data from the Tuolumne Basin (California). We found a density uncertainty of 0.048 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> by comparing output from four models. For typical lidar depth uncertainty (8 cm), density estimation was the dominant source of SWE uncertainty when snow exceeded 60 cm depth, representing &gt;70% of snow cover and 90% of SWE volume throughout the basin in both 2014 and 2016. Density uncertainty accounts for 75% of the SWE uncertainty for a broader range of snowpack characteristics, as measured at SNOTEL stations throughout the western U.S. Reducing density uncertainty is essential for improved SWE mapping with lidar.",

We have studied one southward IMF turning observed by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) and GOES in the dayside magnetosphere. Using a global MHD model, we have reproduced the magnetopause motion in this event. We find that the observed delay in the ground response can be completely explained by deceleration of the directional discontinuity in the subsolar magnetosheath. We show that the speed of the discontinuity significantly decreases in the vicinity of the magnetopause where the magnetic barrier formed during the previous northward IMF interval. The southward turning can reach the magnetopause only after complete disruption of the magnetic barrier. The disruption or dissipation occurs via magnetosheath reconnection, as confirmed by high-speed jets in the magnetosheath. The magnetopause moves sunward as the directional discontinuity transits the magnetosheath. This sunward motion is followed by the earthward motion when the discontinuity strikes the magnetopause and magnetopause reconnection begins.",

In particular, how the ionosphere variability due to the October 2003 Halloween storm would be different if it occurred in January coincident with a major sudden stratosphere warming (SSW) event is investigated. The TIE-GCM simulations reveal that the E\u00d7 B vertical drift velocity and total electron content (TEC) respond differently to the geomagnetic forcing when the lower atmosphere forcing is representative of SSW conditions compared to climatological lower atmosphere forcing conditions. Notably, the storm time variations in the E\u00d7 B vertical drift velocity differ when the SSW-induced zonal mean and tidal variability in the lower thermosphere are considered, and this is in part due to effects of the SSW on the equatorial ionosphere being potentially misinterpreted as being of geomagnetic origin. Differences in the TEC response to the geomagnetic storm can be up to 100% (\u223c30 TEC unit (TECU: 1 TECU = 10<SUP>16</SUP> el m<SUP>-2</SUP>)) of the storm-induced TEC change, and the temporal variability of the TEC during the storm recovery phase is considerably different if SSW effects are considered. The results demonstrate that even during periods of extreme geomagnetic forcing, it is important to consider the effects of lower atmosphere forcing on the ionosphere variability.",

However, the concept that a solar eclipse impacts polar ionosphere behavior and dynamics as well as magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling has not been appreciated. In this study, we investigate the potential impact of the 21 August 2017 solar eclipse on the polar tongue of ionization (TOI) using a high-resolution, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics model. The reduction of electron densities by the eclipse in the middle latitude TOI source region leads to a suppressed TOI in the polar region. The TOI suppression occurred when the solar eclipse moved into the afternoon sector. The Global Positioning System total electron content observations show similar tendency of polar region total electron content suppression. This study reveals that a solar eclipse occurring at middle latitudes may have significant influences on the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

         "abstract": "Based on the ensemble spread, a methodology of measuring uncertainty in weather forecasts, the temperature trend and spread have been estimated using five radiosonde data sets and seven reanalysis products beginning in 1989. The results show that the magnitude of warming or cooling depends on the data sources, atmospheric heights, and geophysical latitudes. Over low-middle latitudes, the cooling varies from -2.6 K/decade in NCEP-DOE to -0.8 K/decade in HADAT2 in the lower stratosphere. The warming weakly changes from 0.2 through 0.4 K/decade in the middle troposphere. Over Antarctica, there is a pronounced warming in the low-middle troposphere in the three NCEP reanalyses and the RATPAC radiosonde data sets, and cooling in the other eight products. Over the Arctic, the warming is observed from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere in all twelve data sets. Significant cooling is identified over the middle stratosphere (above 50 hPa) in all five radiosondes. For global mean temperature, the trend is approximately 0.2 K/decade in the troposphere and -0.8 K/decade in the stratosphere. The spread increases significantly with atmospheric height from approximately 0.1 K/decade at 850hPa to 0.8 K/decade at 30hPa. The spread in the reanalysis data sets is much larger than in the radiosondes in the stratosphere. In contrast, the spread in both the reanalysis and radiosondes data sets is very small and shows the trend in better agreement with each other in the troposphere.",

However, it remains unclear for monsoon precipitation projections. Here we quantified the contributions of internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty to the ensemble spread of global land monsoon precipitation projections using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). For mean precipitation, model uncertainty (contributing ~90%) dominates the projection uncertainty, while the contribution of internal variability (scenario uncertainty) decreases (increases) with time. The source of uncertainty for extreme precipitation differs from that of mean precipitation mainly in long-term projection, with the contribution of scenario uncertainty comparable to model uncertainty. Reducing model uncertainty can effectively narrow the monsoon precipitation projection. The internal variability estimates differ slightly among models and methods, the uncertainty partitioning is robust in middle-long term.",

         "abstract": "Steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events occur during enhanced solar wind driving of the magnetosphere and are characterized by quasi-stable convection, without any substorm expansions, for several hours. Previous research has hinted that a substorm onset may be required before the magnetosphere can enter the SMC mode of response. For the first time, we show statistically that nearly all SMC events are preceded by a substorm. Only 1% of SMC events occur without any preceding substorm signatures. The typical magnetospheric reaction to enhanced solar wind driving is a substorm. After this occurs, we find that the duration and stability of southward IMF determines whether a particular substorm will transition into an SMC event or not. The initial substorm sets up a high pressure region in the inner magnetosphere that causes flux diversion to the flanks, which allows closed flux from the nightside x-line to return to balance the dayside reconnection rate.",

These initially precipitating electrons of magnetospheric origin can also be additionally reflected back into the magnetosphere, leading to a series of multiple reflections by the two magnetically conjugate atmospheres that can greatly impact the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km). The resultant population of secondary and primary electrons cascades toward lower energies and escape back to the magnetosphere. Escaping upward electrons traveling from the ionosphere can be trapped in the magnetosphere, as they travel inside the loss cone, via Coulomb collisions with the cold plasma, or by interactions with various plasma waves. Even though this scenario is intuitively transparent, this magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling element is not considered in any of the existing diffuse aurora research. Nevertheless, as we demonstrate in this letter, this process has the potential to dramatically affect the formation of electron precipitated fluxes in the regions of diffuse auroras.",

Eclipse simulations show temperature changes in the path of totality up to -3 K near the surface, -1 K at the stratopause, \u00b14 K in the mesosphere, and -40 K in the thermosphere. In the F region ionosphere, electron density is depleted by about 55%. Both the temperature and electron density exhibit global effects in the hours following the eclipse. There are also significant effects on stratosphere-mesosphere chemistry, including an increase in ozone by nearly a factor of 2 at 65 km. Dynamical impacts of the eclipse in the lower atmosphere appear to propagate to the upper atmosphere. This study provides insight into coupled eclipse effects through the entire atmosphere from the surface through the ionosphere.",

To understand what makes this difference, we studied near-Earth magnetotail conditions at a pseudosubstorm onset and the subsequent substorm onset, using multipoint Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms spacecraft data. In the present event, near-Earth magnetic reconnection possibly occurred before initial brightening for both pseudosubstorm and substorm. In the near-Earth magnetotail at X \u223c- 10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, the ion \u03b2, ion pressure, and ion and total (ion plus magnetic) pressure gradient projection along two closely located spacecraft were smaller and magnetic field lines were less stretched around the pseudosubstorm initial brightening than around the substorm initial brightening. Dipolarization did not occur for the pseudosubstorm, whereas it began just before poleward expansion for the substorm. These observations suggest that conditions of the near-Earth magnetotail possibly affect whether the initial action develops into a full-fledged substorm.",

         "abstract": "Wave aurora produces broadband particle acceleration. For many years, this type of signature was anecdotally but widely thought to occur primarily at the poleward edge of the auroral oval. Recent statistical work has found that, on the contrary, for strong solar wind driving, broadband aurora is common throughout the auroral oval. Of particular interest is the occurrence of wave aurora below 68 degrees MLAT. We have studied the dependence of such signatures, both as a function of solar wind driving, and as a function of substorm cycle. A set of about 1800 substorm onsets identified by Polar UVI, along with 116 isolated substorm onsets, were used for superposed epoch analysis. The results show that the wave aurora has a very strong substorm cycle dependence, rising dramatically in the first few minutes after onset, and peaking about 10-15 minutes later. By contrast, wave aurora has no easily identifiable solar wind driving peak, although the general trend is for wave aurora to become more common with higher driving (as do substorms themselves). This evidence adds to previous circumstantial evidence associating wave aurora particularly with substorms (for example, wave auroral power is much more strongly peaked in the premidnight region than is monoenergetic or \u201cinverted-V\u201d aurora).",

Using Cassini measurements, we report a typical event in which four successive dipolarization fronts (DFs) were observed within 1 hour during the substorm in Saturn's magnetotail. The last three DFs caused a type of stepwise electron acceleration and generated energetic electrons. The pitch angle distributions of the electrons show evidence of the Fermi acceleration mechanism behind these DFs. Therefore, we infer the magnetotail dynamics process during Saturn's substorm: The stepwise acceleration by successive DFs powerfully accelerates the field-aligned electrons and generates field-aligned energetic electrons. These high-energy electrons are injected into the inner magnetosphere and become an important trigger of Saturn's aurora. Our results show an efficient acceleration mechanism for the electrons caused by successive DFs and confirm an important source of energetic particles during the substorm in Saturn, and these findings improve our understanding of Saturn's substorm and magnetotail dynamics.",

         "abstract": "This paper compares results from a whole atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model, GAIA, with the COSMIC and TIMED/SABER observations during the 2008/2009 northern winter season. The GAIA model has assimilated meteorological reanalysis data by a nudging method. The comparison shows general agreement in the major features from the stratosphere to the ionosphere including the growth and decay of the major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event in 2009. During this period, a pronounced semidiurnal variation in the F region electron density and its local-time phase shift similar to the previous observations are reproduced by the model and COSMIC observation. The model suggests that the electron density variation is caused by an enhanced semidiurnal variation in the E \u00d7 B drift, which is probably related to an amplified semidiurnal migrating tide (SW2) in the lower thermosphere. The model and TIMED/SABER observation show that the SW2 tide amplifies at low latitudes from the stratosphere to the thermosphere as well as the phase variation. Possible mechanisms for the SW2 variability in the low latitude stratosphere could be the change of its propagation condition, especially the (2, 2) mode, due to changing zonal background wind and meridional temperature gradient, and/or an enhancement of its source due to redistribution of stratospheric ozone. Present results also show a prominent long-term variation of the terdiurnal migrating component (TW3) in the ionosphere and atmosphere.",

         "abstract": "In common treatment of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at high latitudes, the ionosphere is represented by a thin conducting spherical shell, which closes field-aligned currents generated in the magnetosphere. In this approach, the current continuity yields a Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential associated with the ionospheric convection pattern. Solution of the Poisson equation then provides a means of self-consistently describing magnetospheric and ionospheric plasma convection with a feedback of one on the other. While the high-latitude ionospheric convection is driven by the solar wind and magnetosphere interaction, at lower latitudes atmospheric neutral winds start to dominate. The question that arises then is whether and how midlaltitude and low-latitude ionospheric convection affects high-latitude ionospheric and magnetospheric convection. In global magnetospheric models, ionospheric convection equatorward of the low-latitude boundary is excluded from the simulation domain. However, the boundary condition applied at that boundary to the electrostatic potential may be used as a proxy of this convection. In this paper, we explore effects that different idealized low-latitude boundary conditions have on the magnetospheric configuration simulated by the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global magnetohydrodynamic model. To this end, we perform a number of idealized simulations different only in the low-latitude ionospheric boundary condition used. We find that the behavior of the system can be influenced rather significantly by the different boundary conditions, which is expressed by changes in the evolution of the polar cap potential, global magnetospheric convection, and plasma pressure distribution in the magnetotail and on the dayside. The differences in the cross-polar cap potential can reach up to &gt;10%, dependent on the boundary condition used. In the magnetosphere the low-latitude ionospheric boundary condition affects the strength and location of the plasma outflow from the distant tail x-line and the subsequent earthward convection. Changes in the plasma pressure distribution on the nightside are accompanied by noticeable differences in the shape of the magnetotail. We confirm that the changes in the magnetospheric and ionospheric configuration are not just temporal deviations of the system from the same average dynamical state by considering 1 h averages of the magnetospheric flow and pressure distribution. These results verify that the simulated system reaches similar but distinctly different dynamical states dependent on the low-latitude boundary condition applied.",

         "abstract": "The only previously established seasonal auroral variation is that of intense monoenergetic aurora, corresponding to quasi-static acceleration by geomagnetic-field-aligned electric fields. Here we investigate the separate seasonal dependence of both types of electron accelerated aurora (broadband, or wave, in addition to monoenergetic) and both ion and electron diffuse aurora. Dayside and nightside variations are separately considered, as are conditions of low and high solar wind driving. Across these many combinations, several clear patterns emerge. One is that the dayside tends to maximize precipitation in the summer and much more so for low solar wind driving. Nightside precipitation is higher in the winter and much more so for high solar wind driving. The dayside effects are strongest in number flux and stronger in diffuse aurora than accelerated aurora. The ease of ion entry through the summer cusp, along with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality, and the rise in dayside currents in the summer hemisphere adequately explain much (perhaps all) of the dayside behavior. Nightside effects are more apparent in energy flux, with the winter/summer ratio of monoenergetic aurora being the largest: 1.70 for high solar wind driving. However, both other types of electron aurora, diffuse (1.30) and broadband (1.26), also have winter/summer energy fluxes well above unity for high solar wind driving. The nightside seasonal variation of ions is much smaller, with slightly more energy flux postmidnight in the winter but with slightly higher energy fluxes premidnight in the summer. Since the increased nightside fluxes into the winter hemisphere occur primarily under strong solar wind driving, and are much more prominent in energy flux than number flux, they likely reflect increased energization in the winter ionosphere when stronger currents are being driven into the ionosphere from the magnetosphere. Equinoctial behavior tends to lie between the summer and winter hemisphere values, but typically closer to the latter. As a result, nightside electron energy flux summed over the hemispheres is higher around equinox, simply because there is no summer hemisphere.",

         "abstract": "We statistically examine the occurrence rate of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves observed by Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers/Charge Composition Explorer (AMPTE/CCE). We use the 8 Hz magnetic field data set that covers the whole CCE mission period of nearly 4.5 years from August 1984 to January 1989, which is more than three times the period studied by Anderson et al. [&lt;link href=\"#jgra50385-bib-0005\"/&gt;] (~452 days). The large data volume allows us to evaluate the storm phase dependence of the spatial occurrence pattern of EMIC waves. The major results of this study are summarized as follows. (a) The occurrence rate is below 5% on the nightside at all L. On the dayside, the rate is &lt;5% in the inner magnetosphere (L &lt; 6), while it is higher than 5% in the outer magnetosphere (L \u2265 6), up to 25%. The highest rate appears in the afternoon sector. (b) The overall occurrence rate is higher for H-band events than He-band events, except for the opposite feature seen in the inner magnetosphere on the early afternoon-to-post midnightside (L &lt; 6, 14 h &lt; MLT &lt; 22 h). (c) H-band events occur frequently in the outer magnetosphere (L \u2265 7) in the afternoon sector, regardless of geomagnetic activity. Under quiet conditions, H-band events also occur in the outer magnetosphere on the morningside (4 h \u2264 MLT &lt; 8 h). (d) He-band events frequently occur in the inner magnetosphere (L &lt; 7) on the prenoon to duskside (10 h \u2264 MLT &lt; 19 h) under disturbed conditions (Dst \u2264 -50 nT). (e) The storm time He-band waves are generated more frequently during the main phase than the recovery phase, with the main-phase wave excitation seen toward the afternoonside outer magnetosphere (L &gt; 7). The results indicate two independent major processes that cause EMIC wave excitation in the Earth's magnetosphere: one externally triggers H-band waves on the dayside, and the other internally excites He-band waves on the dusk-to-afternoonside. We suggest that the former is due to solar wind compression which leads to perpendicular adiabatic ion heating and in turn an increase in temperature anisotropy, and that the latter is caused by injections of new, highly energetic ion population from the plasma sheet, with its velocity distributions becoming pancake-like on the dusk-to-afternoonside. The frequent occurrence seen on the afternoonside, at a wide L range, and during the main/development phase, strongly suggests the significant role of the sunward surge of the plasmasphere and plasma plumes in the injection-associated (i.e., storm time) EMIC wave generation.",

         "abstract": "A Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) has been used to explore the possible physical connection between a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) and the dynamics and electrodynamics of the lower thermosphere. WAM produces SSWs naturally without the need for external forcing. The classical signatures of an SSW appear in the model with a warming of the winter polar stratosphere, a reversal of the temperature gradient, and a breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex. Substantial changes in the amplitude of stationary planetary wave numbers 1, 2, and 3 occur as the zonal mean zonal wind evolves. The simulations also show a cooling in the mesosphere and a warming in the lower thermosphere consistent with observations. The magnitude of this particular SSW is modest, belonging to the category of minor warming. In the lower thermosphere the amplitude of diurnal, semidiurnal, and terdiurnal, eastward and westward propagating tidal modes change substantially during the event. Since the magnitude of the warming is minor and the tidal interactions with the mean flow and planetary waves are complex, the one-to-one correspondence between tidal amplitudes in the lower thermosphere and the zonal mean and stationary waves in the stratosphere is not entirely obvious. The increase in the magnitude of the terdiurnal tide (TW3) in the lower thermosphere has the clearest correlation with the SSW, although the timing appears delayed by about three days. The fast group velocity of the long vertical wavelength TW3 tide would suggest a faster onset for the direct propagation of the tide from the lower atmosphere. It is possible that changes in the magnitude of the diurnal and semidiurnal tides, with their slower vertical propagation, may interact in the lower thermosphere to introduce a terdiurnal tide with a longer delay. An increase in TW3 in the lower thermosphere would be expected to alter the local time variation of the electrodynamic response. The day-to-day changes in the lower thermosphere winds from WAM are shown to introduce variability in the magnitude of dayside low latitude electric fields, with a tendency during the warming for the dayside vertical drift to be larger and occur earlier, and for the afternoon minimum to be smaller. The numerical simulations suggest that it is quite feasible that a major SSW, with a magnitude seen in January 2009, could cause large changes in lower thermosphere electrodynamics and hence in total electron content.",

         "abstract": "Statistical results on the global distribution of suprathermal electron (0.1-10 keV) fluxes are shown both outside and inside the plasmasphere separately, using electron data from THEMIS. Significant electron fluxes are found within the plasmasphere, although they are nevertheless smaller than the populations outside the plasmasphere. Electron fluxes outside of the plasmapause increase with stronger magnetic activity on the nightside and decrease as a function of increasing magnetic local time (MLT). Inside the plasmasphere, electron fluxes increase just inside of the plasmapause, particularly from the midnight to the dawn sector during active times, while electron distributions are less MLT-dependent during quiet times. Inside the plasmasphere, electron fluxes are larger and more stable at smaller L shells at higher energy (a few to 10 keV), while electron fluxes decrease at smaller L shells at lower energy (less than a few keV). Our new statistical results on the suprathermal electron distribution both inside and outside the plasmasphere provide essential information for the evaluation of wave propagation characteristics. Case analyses have been performed in order to understand potential mechanisms responsible for electron access into the plasmasphere. The first case analysis shows that during a relatively quiet time following a disturbed interval, deeply injected suprathermal electrons remain trapped at low L shells during the refilling of the plasmasphere and eventually form the plasmaspheric population. The second case analysis suggests that a combination of locally enhanced electric field and subsequent energy-dependent azimuthal magnetic drift may be able to trap the suprathermal electrons inside the plasmasphere during a geomagnetically active period.",

         "abstract": "Discrete aurora at Mars, characterized by their small spatial scale and tendency to form near strong crustal magnetic fields, are emissions produced by particle precipitation into the Martian upper atmosphere. Since 2014, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN's (MAVEN's) Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) has obtained a large collection of UV discrete aurora observations during its routine periapsis nightside limb scans. Initial analysis of these observations has shown that, near the strongest crustal magnetic fields in the southern hemisphere, the IUVS discrete aurora detection frequency is highly sensitive to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle. However, the role of other solar wind properties in controlling the discrete aurora detection frequency has not yet been determined. In this work, we use the IUVS discrete aurora observations, along with MAVEN observations of the upstream solar wind, to determine how the discrete aurora detection frequency varies with solar wind dynamic pressure, IMF strength, and IMF cone angle. We find that, outside of the strong crustal field region (SCFR) in the southern hemisphere, the aurora detection frequency is relatively insensitive to the IMF orientation, but significantly increases with solar wind dynamic pressure, and moderately increases with IMF strength. Interestingly however, although high solar wind dynamic pressures cause more aurora to form, they have little impact on the brightness of the auroral emissions. Alternatively, inside the SCFR, the detection frequency is only moderately dependent on the solar wind dynamic pressure, and is much more sensitive to the IMF clock and cone angles. In the SCFR, aurora are unlikely to occur when the IMF points near the radial or anti-radial directions when the cone angle (arccos(B<SUB>x</SUB>/|B|)) is less than 30\u00b0 or between 120\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. Together, these results provide the first comprehensive characterization of how upstream solar wind conditions affect the formation of discrete aurora at Mars.",

         "abstract": "A generalization of the traditional 12-station auroral electrojet (AE) index to include more than 100 magnetometer stations, SME, is an excellent predictor of global auroral power (AP), even at high cadence (1 min). We use this index, and a database of more than 53,000 substorms derived from it, covering 1980-2009, to investigate time and energy scales in the magnetosphere, during substorms and otherwise. We find, contrary to common opinion, that substorms do not have a preferred recurrence rate but instead have two distinct dynamic regimes, each following a power law. The number of substorms recurring after a time \u0394t, N(\u0394t), varies as \u0394t<SUP>-1.19</SUP> for short times (&lt;80 min) and as \u0394t<SUP>-1.76</SUP> for longer times (&gt;3 hours). Other evidence also shows these distinct regimes for the magnetosphere, including a break in the power law spectra for SME at about 3 hours. The time between two consecutive substorms is only weakly correlated (r = 0.18 for isolated and r = 0.06 for recurrent) with the time until the next, suggesting quasiperiodicity is not common. However, substorms do have a preferred size, with the typical peak SME magnitude reaching 400-600 nT, but with a mean of 656 nT, corresponding to a bit less than 40 GW AP. More surprisingly, another characteristic scale exists in the magnetosphere, namely, a peak in the SME distribution around 61 nT, corresponding to about 5 GW precipitating AP. The dominant form of auroral precipitation is diffuse aurora; thus, these values are properties of the magnetotail thermal electron distribution. The characteristic 5 GW value specifically represents a preferred minimum below which the magnetotail rarely drops. The magnetotail experiences continuous loss by precipitation, so the existence of a preferred minimum implies driving that rarely disappears altogether. Finally, the distribution of SME values across all times, in accordance with earlier work on AE, is best fit by the sum of two distributions, each normal in log(SME). The lower distribution (with a 40% weighting) corresponds to the characteristic quiet peak, while the higher value distribution (60% weighting) is an average over the characteristic substorm peak and the subsequent prolonged recovery.",

         "abstract": "Numerical simulations are performed for a sudden stratosphere warming (SSW) under different atmospheric tide and planetary wave forcing conditions to investigate the tidal variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The influence of variability of different tides in the MLT on generating perturbations to the low latitude ionosphere is also investigated. Significant changes are found to occur in the migrating semidiurnal solar (SW2) and lunar (M2) tides as well as in the westward propagating nonmigrating semidiurnal tide with zonal wave number 1 (SW1). The changes in the zonal mean atmosphere that occur during SSWs lead to an enhancement in the SW2 and M2 tides. The vertical wavelength of the SW2 is also changed, resulting in phase variability in the SW2 at a constant altitude. Significant enhancements in the SW1 are found to occur only in the presence of additional planetary wave forcing, and this demonstrates that nonlinear planetary wave\u2212tide interactions lead to the enhanced SW1 during SSWs. The amplitude and phase variability of the SW2 is found to be capable of producing temporal variability in the vertical plasma drift velocity that is similar to the observed variability. Changes in the M2 during SSWs can contribute up to an additional \u223c30% of the total ionosphere variability; however, the overall influence of the lunar tide is found to be dependent upon the phase of the moon relative to the timing of the SSW. Although the influence is relatively minor, the SW1 also contributes to the low latitude ionosphere variability during SSWs. The simulation results for the vertical plasma drift velocity and total electron content (TEC) further illustrate that significant longitude variability occurs in the ionosphere response to SSWs.",

As a result of this, the magnetosheath plays a crucial role in the plasma momentum and energy transport from the interplanetary medium into the magnetosphere. Statistical studies of the magnetosheath are difficult due to the dynamic nature of the terrestrial bow shock and the magnetopause. As a result of this, the spatial and temporal dependence of magnetosheath plasma properties under varying solar wind conditions is still not completely understood. We present a study of magnetosheath plasma properties using 5 years of THEMIS and OMNI data to produce statistical maps of fundamental magnetosheath plasma properties. The magnetosheath interplanetary medium reference frame is applied to present data in a normalized reference frame which accounts for both boundary and orbital motion. The statistical maps are compared with the MHD runs from the CCMC-BATS-R-US model which agree favorably. The results are also used to investigate the presence of any magnetosheath plasma parameter asymmetries and their possible causes.",

         "abstract": "A number of recent studies have highlighted the observational evidence for a coupling between atmospheric tides in the thermosphere and the electron density structure of the ionosphere. The most commonly proposed mechanism to explain this is an electrodynamic coupling between tides at E region altitudes and ion drifts at F region altitudes. However, based on both the observational evidence from recent satellite missions such as those of the neutral winds associated with nonmigrating tides at F region altitudes, and considering the theoretical effects of atmospheric tides on the thermosphere and ionosphere, more than one coupling mechanism must be considered. We use Sami2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere to test a set of electrodynamic and chemical-dynamical coupling mechanisms that could explain the link between tides in the thermosphere and the low-latitude ionosphere. We investigate the possible role of the vertical drifts during the both the day and around sunset, perturbations to the thermospheric neutral density and thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], and tidal winds at F region altitudes. These simulations give an estimate of the sensitivity of the nighttime ionosphere to each of these coupling mechanisms. We then compare the results of these sensitivity tests with the effects of atmospheric tides on different thermospheric parameters as simulated by a self-consistent model of the atmosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamic system (thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model). This comparison shows that in addition to the E region dynamo modulation, the potential coupling between tides and the ionosphere via changes in thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], meridional winds at F region altitudes, and modification of the vertical drifts around sunset could play an important role and all require further study, both with models and new observations.",

         "abstract": "Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) simulations are used to investigate solar and lunar tide changes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) that occur in response to sudden stratosphere warmings (SSWs). The average tidal response is demonstrated based on 23 moderate to strong Northern Hemisphere SSWs. The migrating semidiurnal lunar tide is enhanced globally during SSWs, with the largest enhancements (\u223c60-70%) occurring at mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Enhancements in the migrating solar semidiurnal tide (SW2) also occur up to an altitude of 120 km. Above this altitude, the SW2 decreases in response to SSWs. The SW2 enhancements are 40-50%, making them smaller in a relative sense than the enhancements in the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide. Changes in nonmigrating solar tides are, on average, generally small and the only nonmigrating tides that exhibit changes greater than 20% are the diurnal tide with zonal wave number 0 (D0) and the westward propagating semidiurnal tide with zonal wave number 1 (SW1). D0 is decreased by \u223c20-30% at low latitudes, while SW1 exhibits a similar magnitude enhancement at mid to high latitudes in both hemispheres. The tidal changes are attributed to a combination of changes in the zonal mean zonal winds, changes in ozone forcing of the SW2, and nonlinear planetary wave-tide interactions. We further investigate the influence of the lunar tide enhancements on generating perturbations in the low latitude ionosphere during SSWs by using the WACCM-X thermosphere to drive an ionosphere-electrodynamics model. For both solar maximum and solar minimum simulations, the changes in the equatorial vertical plasma drift velocity are similar to observations when the lunar tide is included in the simulations. However, when the lunar tide is removed from the simulations, the low latitude ionosphere response to SSWs is unclear and the characteristic behavior of the low latitude ionosphere perturbations that is seen in observations is no longer apparent. Our results thus indicate the importance of variability in the lunar tide during SSWs, especially for the coupling between SSWs and perturbations in the low latitude ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "We investigate whether induction within Callisto's electrically conductive ionosphere can explain observed magnetic fields which have previously been interpreted as evidence of induction in a saline, electrically conductive subsurface ocean. Callisto's ionosphere is subject to the flow of time-periodic magnetized plasma of Jupiter's magnetosphere, which induces electric fields and electric currents in Callisto's electrically conductive ionosphere. We develop a simple analytic model for a first quantitative understanding of the effects of induction in Callisto's ionosphere caused by the interaction with a time-variable magnetic field environment. With this model, we also investigate how the associated ionospheric currents close in the ambient magnetospheric plasma. Based on our model, we find that the anisotropic nature of Callisto's ionospheric conductivity generates an enhancement effect on ionospheric loop currents which are driven by the time-variable magnetic field. This effect is similar to the Cowling channel effect known from Earth's ionosphere. Subsequently, we numerically calculate the expected induced magnetic fields due to Jupiter's time-variable magnetic field in an anisotropic conductive ionosphere and compare our results with the Galileo C-3 and C-9 flybys. We find that induction within Callisto's ionosphere is responsible for a significant part of the observed magnetic fields. Ionospheric induction creates induced magnetic fields to some extent similar as expected from a subsurface water ocean. Depending on currently unknown properties such as Callisto's nightside ionosphere, the existence of layers of \"dirty ice\" and the details of the plasma interaction, a water ocean might be located much deeper than previously thought or might not exist at all.",

         "abstract": "Steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events in the Earth's magnetosphere are thought to result from balancing the rate of opening flux through solar wind-magnetosphere reconnection at the dayside magnetopause to the rate of closing flux through reconnection in the magnetotail. For this to occur, reconnected flux in the tail must return to the dayside to balance the dayside reconnection rate. Using Geotail and THEMIS data over a span of 14 years, we examine the average plasma conditions and fast Earthward flows during SMC intervals and compare them to other types of geomagnetic activity, such as quiet intervals, isolated substorm phases, and the two hours before an SMC (Pre-SMC intervals). We show that the average total pressure in the inner magnetosphere is higher during SMC events than for other types of activity. This higher pressure region extends to larger radial distances, and causes fast Earthward flows to divert toward the dawn or dusk flanks and continue to the dayside. This pattern is contrasted to substorms, during which flows are directed toward the inner magnetosphere and flux remains there in the \u201cpile-up region.\u201d We suggest that the SMC pattern of flow deflection carries enough flux from the tail to the dayside to allow for balanced reconnection. Finally, the Pre-SMC intervals have plasma conditions that are similar to, but slightly weaker than, SMC events. Since most SMCs begin with a substorm, this indicates that preconditioning of the magnetosphere by prior geomagnetic activity is important in setting up the magnetotail for an SMC state.",

         "abstract": "We introduce a new model to study Jupiter's magnetosphere and how it interacts with the solar wind. We first derive a set of one-fluid MHD equations to consistently include the ion-neutral collisions in Jupiter's ionosphere and the mass loading in the Io torus. The mass loading and the subsequent radial mass transport in Jupiter's magnetosphere leads to a deviation from full corotation of the magnetospheric plasma. Ion-neutral collisions in Jupiter's ionosphere and subsequent transport of angular momentum out into the magnetosphere acts to spin up the magnetosphere's plasma. Our model explicitly includes mass loading in the Io plasma torus and an inner boundary region, which represents the effects of Jupiter's ionosphere. We present the results of five model runs where different mass loading rates and ionospheric conductances are used. For these model runs, we consider an antiparallel interplanetary magnetic field and a strong solar wind dynamic pressure, resulting in a compressed magnetosphere. The results are compared with analytical models, in situ measurements, and remote-sensing observations. Our azimuthal velocity profiles and the position of the corotation breakdown are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions by Hill (1979, 2001) and Saur et al., (2004a), and Voyager observations. The total current flowing into and out of the ionosphere is 48.7 MA, which is in agreement with estimates from measurements and analytical models. Using the field aligned electric current j<SUB>\u2225</SUB> to determine the position of the aurorae, we find that our main auroral oval is associated, as expected, with the position of the corotation breakdown (between 20.6 R<SUB>J</SUB> and 30.1 R<SUB>J</SUB> for the different model runs). The discontinuity in the main oval observed by Radioti et al. (2008) is also present in our results, where it is caused by an asymmetry in the pressure distribution, due to the interaction between the rotating plasma and the magnetopause.",

         "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the ionosphere is an important source of ions in the magnetosphere and until recently this population has largely been neglected from many global simulations. In this study, a causally regulated cusp O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow is added to the multifluid version of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global simulation. The cusp outflow algorithm uses empirical relationships to regulate the outflow flux with further conditioning to isolate the outflow spatially to a dynamic cusp. The impact cusp O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow has on the magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) system is investigated for a moderate storm on 31 August 2005. It is found the MI system response depends upon the specification of the outflow velocity and temperature. More energetic outflow tends to flow downtail whilst colder, slower outflow fills the inner magnetosphere. High O<SUP>+</SUP> densities in the inner magnetosphere can increase the strength of the ring current, reducing Dst and inflating the magnetosphere. This effect is mostly found for the less energetic outflow specification. O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow is found to reduce the access of solar wind ions to the inner magnetosphere, which, through the MI coupling in LFM reduces the precipitating electron power, conductance and field-aligned currents. The effect outflow has on the cross polar cap potential (CPCP) depends upon two competing factors. The reduction in Region I currents when outflow is present appears to increase the CPCP whilst the inflation of the magnetosphere due to an enhanced ring current decreases the CPCP.",

Our study showed that the plasmaspheric density structures fundamentally follow the ionosphere, but there are also significant differences between them. Although the diurnal variations are very similar to each region, the plasmasphere shows much weaker variations, only approximately 1 TECU day-night difference. By analyzing the day-night differences in the plasmasphere, we found that the plasmaspheric contribution to the nighttime ionosphere does not increase with solar activity and the largest contribution occurs during June solstice. The plasmasphere shows similar seasonal variations to the ionosphere, except for the semiannual variation, which is essentially absent in the plasmasphere. There is also an important difference in the annual variation: although the annual variation in the ionosphere exists regardless of longitude, it occurs only at American sector in the plasmasphere. As solar activity increases to moderate level, the pTEC substantially enhances from approximately 2 to 4 TECU at the initial increase of solar activity below F10.7p = 100 and then quickly slows down while the iTEC almost linearly enhances. Although it is well known that magnetic storms are the major source of plasmaspheric density depletion, pTEC does not show this aspect of the plasmasphere probably due to the relatively small K<SUB>p</SUB> values for high magnetic activity (K<SUB>p</SUB> &gt; 2.5) in the current study.",

         "abstract": "The substorm mechanism is investigated by analyzing the numerical results obtained through the use of the recently refined magnetohydrodynamic model. After showing the growth phase features, the numerical solution reproduces the observed signatures of a substorm onset, including the formation of a near-Earth neutral line (NENL), earthward directed flow in the plasma sheet, a dipolarization, a geosynchronous D deflection, the development of the nightside field aligned currents (FACs), and electrojets in the ionosphere. The onset is triggered by a sudden collapse of the plasma sheet and a successive formation of a high-pressure region in the inner magnetosphere. The energy source of this high-pressure region is the magnetic tension released from the NENL. The tail disturbance is primary transmitted to the ionosphere by the region 2 FAC accompanying the high-pressure region formed in the inner magnetosphere. The associated nightside region 1 FAC is not connected to the traditional current wedge but to the cusp region. The region 1 FAC path to the ionosphere develops from dayside to nightside, so as to construct a grand loop with the region 2 FAC from the partial ring current. In the grand loop, the region 1 FAC provides a short circuit in the ionosphere for the region 2 FAC. In the expansion phase, convection enhances to relax the distorted pressure distribution formed at the onset, accompanied by a further development of dipolarization and a thickening of the plasma sheet in the magnetosphere and increases in the westward and eastward electrojets in the ionosphere. The present model can explain the explosive growth phase and the thinning of the midtail plasma sheet just after the onset.",

We compare R against the composite sunspot group data from the Royal Greenwich Observatory network and the Solar Optical Observing Network, using both the number of sunspot groups, N<SUB>G</SUB>, and the total area of the sunspots, A<SUB>G</SUB>. In addition, we compare R with the recently developed interdiurnal variability geomagnetic indices IDV and IDV(1d). In all four cases, linearity of the relationship with R is not assumed and care is taken to ensure that the relationship of each with R is the same before and after the putative calibration change. It is shown the probability that a correction is not needed is of order 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and that R is indeed too low before 1945. The optimum correction to R for values before 1945 is found to be 11.6%, 11.7%, 10.3%, and 7.9% using A<SUB>G</SUB>, N<SUB>G</SUB>, IDV, and IDV(1d), respectively. The optimum value obtained by combining the sunspot group data is 11.6% with an uncertainty range 8.1-14.8% at the 2\u03c3 level. The geomagnetic indices provide an independent yet less stringent test but do give values that fall within the 2\u03c3 uncertainty band with optimum values are slightly lower than from the sunspot group data. The probability of the correction needed being as large as 20%, as advocated by Svalgaard (2011), is shown to be 1.6 \u00d7 10<SUP>-5</SUP>.",

         "abstract": "We present observations of proton aurora at Mars made using the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) onboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft. Martian proton aurora display a prominent intensity enhancement in the hydrogen Lyman-alpha (121.6 nm) emission between ~110 and 150 km altitude. Using altitude-intensity profiles from periapsis limb scan data spanning nearly two Martian years, we create a comprehensive database of proton aurora and characterize their phenomenology. Due to Mars' lack of a global dipole magnetic field, Martian proton aurora are expected to form on the dayside via electron stripping and charge exchange between solar wind protons and the neutral corona. We observe proton aurora in ~14% of dayside periapsis profiles (with notable seasonal variability), making proton aurora the most commonly observed type of aurora at Mars. We determine that the primary factors influencing proton aurora occurrence rates are solar zenith angle and season. The highest proton aurora occurrence rates are at low solar zenith angles on the Mars dayside, consistent with known formation processes. Proton aurora have highest emission enhancements, peak intensities, peak altitudes, and occurrence rates (nearing 100%) around southern summer solstice. This time period corresponds with the seasonal inflation of the neutral lower atmosphere, the onset of Martian dust storm season, seasonally increased coronal hydrogen column densities, and higher atmospheric temperature and solar wind flux following perihelion. The results of our study provide a new understanding of the primary factors influencing proton aurora, and the long-term variability of these phenomena as observed over multiple Mars years.",

We find that the azimuthal current intensity, and thus the stretching of the magnetic field lines, is dependent on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, i.e., the ionospheric Pedersen conductivity and iogenic plasma mass outflow rate. Overall, however, the equatorial magnetic field profiles obtained are similar in the inner region to those used previously, such that the currents are of the same order as previous solutions obtained using a fixed empirical equatorial field strength model, although the outer fringing field of the current disc acts to reverse the field-aligned current in the outer region. We also find that while the azimuthal current in the inner region is dominated by hot plasma pressure, as is generally held to be the case for Jupiter, the use of a realistic plasma angular velocity profile actually results in the centrifugal current becoming dominant in the outer magnetosphere. In addition, despite the dependence of the intensity of the azimuthal current on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, the location of the peak field-aligned current in the equatorial plane also varies, such that the ionospheric location remains roughly constant. It is thus found that significant changes to the mass density of the iogenic plasma disc are required to explain the variation in the main oval location observed using the Hubble Space Telescope.",

Earthward fast flows can thus be used as a proxy for energy and momentum transfer into the closed magnetosphere during the course of a substorm. Characteristics of flows observed before substorm onset can provide information on the role of the flows in substorm onset triggering as well as the sequence of substorm-related processes. We use 15 years of data obtained by Geotail, Cluster, and THEMIS to study statistically the distribution of earthward plasma sheet flows during substorms. Substorm phases are determined from time series of the AL index and the z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field. We find that the occurrence frequency of medium-speed (100 km/s &lt; V &lt; 500 km/s) flows increases slightly toward the end of the substorm growth phase. At substorm onset there is a sharp increase of medium-speed flows, and during substorm recovery there is a gradual decrease of such flows. The occurrence frequency of high-speed (V &gt; 500 km/s) flows, on the other hand, does not clearly increase during the substorm growth phase. The increase at substorm onset is more gradual than for the medium-speed flows. The occurrence frequency of high-speed flows peaks at the beginning of substorm recovery. These results indicate that any effect of the flows on substorm onset triggering would be caused by medium rather than very high speed flows.",

         "abstract": "The large-scale dynamic behavior of Mercury's highly compressed magnetosphere is predominantly powered by magnetic reconnection, which transfers energy and momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. The contribution of flux transfer events (FTEs) at the dayside magnetopause to the redistribution of magnetic flux in Mercury's magnetosphere is assessed with magnetic field data acquired in orbit about Mercury by the Magnetometer on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. FTEs with core fields greater than the planetary field just inside the magnetopause are prevalent at Mercury. Fifty-eight such large-amplitude FTEs were identified during February and May 2012, when MESSENGER sampled the subsolar magnetosheath. The orientation of each FTE was determined by minimum variance analysis, and the magnetic flux content of each was estimated using a force-free flux rope model. The average flux content of the FTEs was 0.06 MWb, and their durations imply a transient increase in the cross-polar cap potential of ~25 kV. For a substorm timescale of 2-3 min, as indicated by magnetotail flux loading and unloading, the FTE repetition rate (10 s) and average flux content (assumed to be 0.03 MWb) imply that FTEs contribute at least ~30% of the flux transport required to drive the Mercury substorm cycle. At Earth, in contrast, FTEs are estimated to contribute less than 2% of the substorm flux transport. This result implies that whereas at Earth, at which steady-state dayside reconnection is prevalent, multiple X-line dayside reconnection and associated FTEs at Mercury are a dominant forcing for magnetospheric dynamics.",

         "abstract": "Auroral substorms are often associated with optical ray or bead structures during initial brightening (substorm auroral onset waves). Occurrence probabilities and properties of substorm onset waves have been characterized using 112 substorm events identified in Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imager data and compared to Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E) and kinetic instability properties. All substorm onsets were found to be associated with optical waves, and thus, optical waves are a common feature of substorm onset. Eastward propagating wave events are more frequent than westward propagating wave events and tend to occur during lower-latitude substorms (stronger solar wind driving). The wave propagation directions are organized by orientation of initial brightening arcs. We also identified notable differences in wave propagation speed, wavelength (wave number), period, and duration between westward and eastward propagating waves. In contrast, the wave growth rate does not depend on the propagation direction or substorm strength but is inversely proportional to the wave duration. This suggests that the waves evolve to poleward expansion at a certain intensity threshold and that the wave properties do not directly relate to substorm strengths. However, waves are still important for mediating the transition between the substorm growth phase and poleward expansion. The relation to arc orientation can be explained by magnetotail structures in the RCM-E, indicating that substorm onset location relative to the pressure peak determines the wave propagation direction. The measured wave properties agree well with kinetic ballooning interchange instability, while cross-field current instability and electromagnetic ion cyclotron instability give much larger propagation speed and smaller wave period.",

         "abstract": "By performing a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation, we have demonstrated for the first time that an electrojet at the dayside magnetic equator can be reversed and an overshielding condition can be established in the inner magnetosphere after substorm onset without northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field. Near the substorm onset, the plasma pressure is highly enhanced in the inner magnetosphere on the nightside. The Region 2 field-aligned current diverges from the diamagnetic current on the surface of the dayside extension of the high-pressure region, which is connected to the ionosphere in the relatively low-conductivity region a few degrees equatorward of the main auroral oval that is formed as the projection of the plasma sheet. The separation of the equatorward boundary of the auroral region and the equatorward boundary of the Region 2 current results in dusk-dawn electric fields that generate a counter electrojet (CEJ) at the dayside magnetic equator. Poleward electric fields in a narrow latitudinal width, which may be regarded as subauroral ion drift and subauroral polarization stream, are simultaneously intensified. The dusk-dawn electric fields may propagate to the inner magnetosphere along a field line as shear Alfv\u00e9n waves. Then, the inner magnetosphere is completely constrained by the overshielding condition. The intensity and polarity of the CEJ depend largely on at least the ionospheric conductivity that is related to the plasma pressure (probably associated with diffuse aurora). This may explain the observational fact that overshielding does not always occur after onset.",

         "abstract": "Substorms release a large amount of energy, some of which is used to energize the precipitating particles in the polar region. Superposed epoch analysis was performed with 11 years of DMSP SSJ/4/5 data to characterize the substorm cycle of the diffuse, monoenergetic, and broadband/wave precipitating electrons and precipitating ions. Although substorms only increase the ion pressure by 30%, they increase the power of the diffuse, monoenergetic, and wave electron aurora by 310%, 71%, and 170%, respectively. Substorms energize the ion aurora mainly in the 21:00-05:00 magnetic local time (MLT) sector. The dynamics of the diffuse electron aurora are different from those of the other two electron aurorae. The expansion phase duration is approximately 15 min for the monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae, whereas it is 1 h for the diffuse electron aurora. The monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae appear to complete the substorm cycle within a 5 h interval, whereas the diffuse electron aurora takes more than 5 h. The diffuse electron aurora power and energy flux start increasing at 15 min before the substorm onset, whereas those for the monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae start increasing at 1 h and 15 min before the onset. The increase in the monoenergetic electron aurora power and energy flux may result from the increase in the magnetotail stretching and region-1 field-aligned current during the growth phase. The monoenergetic electrons may also be associated with fast flows, which have been previously observed more frequently in the dusk-midnight sector.",

         "abstract": "We investigate localized magnetosheath and solar wind density enhancements, associated with clear magnetic field changes, and therefore referred to as magnetosheath/solar wind plasmoids, respectively. Using Cluster data, we show that there are two distinct populations of magnetosheath plasmoids, one associated with a decrease of magnetic field strength (diamagnetic plasmoids), and one with an increased magnetic field strength (paramagnetic plasmoids). The diamagnetic magnetosheath plasmoids have scale sizes of the order of 1-10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, while the paramagnetic ones are an order of magnitude smaller. The diamagnetic plasmoids are not associated with any change in the magnetosheath plasma flow velocity, and they are classified as embedded plasmoids in the terminology of Karlsson et al. (2012). The paramagnetic plasmoids may either be embedded or associated with increases in flow velocity (fast plasmoids). A search for plasmoids in the pristine solar wind resulted in identification of 62 diamagnetic plasmoids with very similar properties to the magnetosheath diamagnetic plasmoids, making it probable that the solar wind is the source of these structures. No paramagnetic plasmoids are found in the pristine solar wind, indicating that these are instead created at the bow shock or in the magnetosheath. We discuss the relation of the plasmoids to the phenomenon of magnetosheath jets, with which they have many properties in common, and suggest that the paramagnetic plasmoids can be regarded as a subset of these or a closely related phenomenon. We also discuss how the results from this study relate to theories addressing the formation of magnetosheath jets.",

         "abstract": "We analyze an isolated substorm on 29 March 2009 observed by the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and well monitored by ground-based observatories at and near station Gillam. The event provides a rare opportunity for monitoring the substorm magnetic topology thanks to fortuitous clustering of the THEMIS probes, complemented by the GOES 12 spacecraft. The neutral sheet position was found to be displaced by \u223c0.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> northward from its average location. The peak cross-tail current density was estimated to be \u223c20 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP> at the end of the growth phase, revealing the formation of a thin current sheet during the last 15 min prior to the expansion onset. The fortuitous spacecraft conjunction allowed us to construct an adjusted time-varying model based on magnetic field and pressure observations during the substorm. We then used the adjusted model to map the location of the spacecraft to the ionosphere and the breakup from the ionosphere to the equatorial region. Significant time-dependent differences between this and the standard models (e.g., T96) do exist, resulting in breakup mapping to \u223c22 R<SUB>E</SUB>, compared to 12 R<SUB>E</SUB> if classical models are used. Moreover, we find that spacecraft footprints in the ionosphere move significantly equatorward (2\u00b0) over tens of minutes during the growth phase but jump poleward (2\u00b0-4\u00b0) after expansion onset. Since such motions are also typical for auroral arcs during substorms, we infer that magnetic field reconfiguration during various substorm phases, rather than plasma motion in the equatorial magnetosphere, is largely responsible for the observed motion of the aurora.",

         "abstract": "Observational properties of throat aurora are investigated in detail by using 7 year continuous auroral observations obtained at Yellow River Station (magnetic latitude 76.24\u00b0N). From our inspection, throat aurora is often observed under the condition of stripy diffuse aurora contacting with the persistent discrete auroral oval, and the long-period throat aurora observations generally consist of intermittent subsequences of throat aurora brightening followed by poleward moving auroral form and throat aurora dimming. We also noticed that the orientation of throat aurora is aligned along the ionospheric convection flow, and its local time distribution shows clear dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>y</SUB> component. These observational results indicate that factors inside the magnetosphere may play important role on occurrence of throat aurora. We thus suggest that throat aurora may present the ionospheric signature of redistribution of reconnection rate on the magnetopause by cold magnetospheric plasma flowing into the reconnection site. In addition, we also found that the occurrence rate of throat aurora clearly decreases with increase of the IMF cone angle (arccos(|B<SUB>x</SUB>|/B)), which is very similar with the occurrence rate of high-speed jet (HSJ) observed in magnetosheath depending on the IMF cone angle. This is suggested as that the HSJs occurred outside the magnetosphere may also play important role for generation of throat aurora by triggering magnetopause reconnection or by direct impacting. Although further studies are needed to clarify how the throat auroras are generated in detail, the relevant observations about throat aurora have presented important implications on a variety open questions, such as distribution and generation of cold plasma structures in the outer magnetosphere, magnetopause deformation, and possible relation between HSJ and reconnection.",

         "abstract": "In order to study the dynamical role of gravity waves (GWs) propagating upward from the lower atmosphere to the thermosphere, numerical simulation using a high-resolution general circulation model that contains the region from the ground surface to the exobase (about 500 km height) has been performed. Our results indicate that the zonal momentum drag due to breaking/dissipation of GWs (GW drag) plays an important role not only in the mesosphere but also in the thermosphere. In particular, the GW drag at high latitudes in the150-250 km height region exceeds 200 ms<SUP>-1</SUP> (d)<SUP>-1</SUP> and is important for the zonal momentum balance. The semidiurnal variation of the GW drag is dominant in the 100-200 km height region, while the diurnal variation of the GW drag prevails above a height of 200 km. The GW drag in the thermosphere is mainly directed against the background zonal wind, indicating the filtering effect by the background wind. A global view of the GW activity in the middle and upper atmosphere is also investigated. The global distribution of the GW activity in the thermosphere is not uniform, and there are some enhanced regions of the GW activity. The GW activity in the thermosphere is stronger in high latitudes than in low latitudes. The GW activity in the winter thermosphere is influenced by the mesospheric jet and the planetary wave activity in the mesosphere.",

         "abstract": "In the high-latitude regions of Saturn, the ionosphere is strongly coupled to the magnetosphere through the exchange of energy. The influx of energetic particles from Saturn's magnetosphere enhances the ionospheric densities and temperatures, affects the electrodynamical properties of the ionosphere, and contributes to the heating of the thermosphere. It is therefore critical to accurately model the energy deposition of these magnetospheric particles in the upper atmosphere in order to evaluate key ionospheric quantities of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. We present comprehensive results of ionospheric calculations in the auroral regions of Saturn using our Saturn Thermosphere-Ionosphere Model (STIM). We focus on solar minimum conditions during equinox. The atmospheric conditions are derived from the STIM 3-D General Circulation Model. The ionospheric component is self-consistently coupled to the solar and auroral energy deposition component. The precipitating electrons are assumed to have a Maxwellian distribution in energy with a mean energy E<SUB>m</SUB> and an energy flux Q<SUB>0</SUB>. In the presence of hard electron precipitation (1 &lt; E<SUB>m</SUB> \u2264 20 keV) with Q<SUB>0</SUB> &gt; 0.04 mW m<SUP>-2</SUP>, the ionospheric conductances are found to be proportional to the square root of the energy flux, but the response of the ionosphere is not instantaneous and a time delay needs to be applied to Q<SUB>0</SUB> when estimating the conductances. In the presence of soft electron precipitation (E<SUB>m</SUB> &lt; 500 eV) with Q<SUB>0</SUB> \u2264 0.2 mW m<SUP>-2</SUP>, the ionospheric conductances at noon are found to be primarily driven by the Sun. However, soft auroral electrons are efficient at increasing the ionospheric total electron content and at heating the thermal electron population.",

         "abstract": "Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) observations of the total electron content (TEC) above and below 800 km are used to study the local time and seasonal variation of longitude structures in both the F region ionosphere as well as the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere. The COSMIC observations reveal the presence of distinct longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC, and these further exhibit a seasonal and local time dependence. The predominant feature observed at all local times in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC is a substantial maximum (minimum) during Northern Hemisphere winter (summer) around 300\u00b0-360\u00b0 geographic longitude. Around equinox, at a fixed local time, a wave 4 variation in longitude prevails in the daytime F region TEC as well as the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC. The wave 4 variation in longitude persists into the nighttime in the F region; however, the nighttime topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC exhibits two maxima in longitude. The COSMIC observations clearly reveal the presence of substantial longitude variations in the F region and topside ionosphere-plasmasphere, and to elucidate the source of the longitude variations, results are presented based on the coupling between the Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere model and the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. The model simulations demonstrate that the orientation of the geomagnetic field plays a fundamental role in generating significant longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere but does not considerably influence longitude variations in the F region ionosphere. The model results further confirm that nonmigrating tides are the primary mechanism for generating longitude variations in the F region ionosphere. The coupled model additionally demonstrates that nonmigrating tides are also of considerable importance for the generation of longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC.",

         "abstract": "Recent observations from the 2-D array of high-resolution THEMIS all-sky imagers (ASIs) during the 2008 tail season have shown that the majority of substorm onsets are preceded by equatorward extension of an auroral arc initiated at the poleward boundary of the aurora zone, and that the aurora breakup is likely triggered when this precursor arc reaches the onset region. These observations were used to suggest that substorm onset is driven by a new population of plasma having lower global entropy content than that of the preexisting plasma intruding into the inner plasma sheet. We have taken advantage of conjunctions between the location of the precursor arc observed by the THEMIS ASI and THEMIS spacecraft and identified four events where clear signatures of the proposed new plasma intrusion were observed simultaneously in both the magnetotail and ionosphere. In two of the events, the intrusion plasma was captured more than 10 min before substorm onset in the midtail plasma sheet. The intruding plasma is characterized as the reduction of the pressure and entropy parameter associated with more dipolarized magnetic field, as well as the enhancement of the duskward electric field and earthward flow. In two other events, the plasma intrusion was found within 2 min before onset in the inner plasma sheet region R \u223c11 R<SUB>E</SUB>, which is very close to the onset locations. These observations are consistent with the proposal that intrusion of low-entropy content plasma to the onset region may provide a trigger for substorm onset. We also found two plasma intrusion events not associated with substorm onset in the plasma sheet, which indicates that the new plasma intrusion is not a sufficient condition for substorm onset. We suggest that sufficient pressure and azimuthal pressure gradient buildup in the inner plasma sheet during growth phase should be another necessary condition.",

         "abstract": "We present a fortuitous case of an isolated substorm on 29 March 2009, observed by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interaction during Substorms (THEMIS) probes clustered at \u223c11-14 R<SUB>E</SUB> with simultaneous coverage by the THEMIS ground network. The four probes are at roughly the same radial and azimuthal location, with one probe staying near the neutral sheet during entire growth phase and during the ensuing transition to the substorm expansion phase. Prior to substorm onset, THEMIS observed the damping of earthward convection and development of an embedded tail current sheet with half thickness \u2264 0.15 R<SUB>E</SUB> and current density \u223c20 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP>, while the total magnetic field closest to the neutral sheet was below 2 nT. Tail activity was observed to start prior to substorm onset tailward of the THEMIS probes (&lt;-14 R<SUB>E</SUB>) with the gradual increase of earthward flow and total pressure in front of an earthward moving bursty bulk flow event (BBF). There was no evidence of an outward propagating rarefaction wave prior to BBF onset. Peak flow was accompanied by two short dipolarization pulses, followed by a sharp reduction of the total pressure (up to 30-50%) and a decrease in the lobe magnetic field. By analyzing the lobe field waveforms, we infer their reconnection origin and argue that different onset-related magnetotail phenomena discussed in past literature (BBFs, bubbles, current disruption, nightside flux transfer events, earthward traveling convection regions) are views of the same dissipative structure formed by reconnection, when it is observed from different vantage points. Although the first ionospheric signatures of the substorm were observed near the equatorward edge of the auroral oval, the adaptive magnetospheric model maps the breakup to the tail current sheet at 15-20 R<SUB>E</SUB>, consistent with other estimates of the substorm onset location available in our case. The event provides definite evidence in favor of tail reconnection within a thin current sheet as the primary substorm initiation process. It also demonstrates that actual changes of tail current magnitude in the magnetotail can be an order of magnitude larger, compared to the magnitude of 3-D current inferred from ground observations.",

         "abstract": "We combine 4861 identifications of substorm onsets from satellite global imagers (Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV) with DMSP particle data to investigate the substorm cycle dependence of the diffuse aurora (electrons and ions), monoenergetic aurora (produced by quasi-static electric fields), and broadband aurora (associated with Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration). Although all types of aurora increase at substorm onset, broadband aurora shows a particular association with substorms and, especially, substorm onset. While diffuse electron and monoenergetic auroral precipitating power rises by 79% and 90%, respectively, following an onset, wave aurora rises by 182%. In the first 10-15 min following onset, the power associated with Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration is comparable to monoenergetic acceleration (also called \u201cinverted V\u201d events). In general, this is not the case before onset, or indeed, during recovery. The rise time of the electron diffuse aurora following onset is much slower, about 50 min, and thus presumably extends into recovery. Discrete acceleration, which rises over just a few minutes, is already deep into decline, while diffuse auroral power is still rising. Most of the sharp increase in Alfv\u00e9nic precipitating power at onset is associated with a 132% jump in the characteristic energy associated with broadband acceleration. Previous work has associated PiB signatures (which are compressional) in the magnetotail with dipolarization. More recently, FAST observations near the auroral zone have been used to show that there are nearly simultaneous sharp increases in Alfv\u00e9n waves, apparently created by mode coupling. The present work strongly supports the idea that the Alfv\u00e9nic aurora has a particular connection to substorm onsets, with much of the auroral power over a substorm cycle concentrated shortly after onset. Finally, a superposed epoch analysis of commonly used coupling functions indicates a drop in the mean solar wind driving starting 20 min before substorm onset. However, the distribution of increases and decreases in solar wind driving is roughly symmetric about a peak at zero (no change) but with (rare) large drops in solar wind driving (\u201cnorthward turnings\u201d) outweighing large increases. Comparison with the distribution of random changes in solar wind driving leads us to suggest that probably only a minority of substorms are externally driven.",

Made by the UVIS imager on the Cassini spacecraft, these observations differ from previous UV observations of Saturn's aurora by offering complete local time coverage of the aurora from small zenith angles. A statistical picture emerges after combining over 10<SUP>5</SUP> spectrographic images of the north and south aurora. From its composite, the northern aurora exhibits an intensity peak of \u223c40 kR near 05 h local time, while the southern aurora peaks at \u223c60 kR near the same local time. Aurora intensities in the post-noon sectors are essentially constant at \u223c10 kR. The half-power points of latitudinal profiles reveal widths of \u223c4\u00b0 near dawn and \u223c8\u00b0 near dusk in both north and south. The aurora has an approximately circular shape (not oval!), although harmonic fits suggest the northern aurora is more nearly circular than the southern. The center of the northern aurora has an offset of \u223c1-2\u00b0 from the pole, while the southern center is offset by \u223c2-3\u00b0, with both offsets in the midnight-to-dawn quadrant. When mapped to the polar regions, precipitation of field-aligned energetic electrons (&gt;20 keV) generally lies equatorward of the main auroral intensity at all local times.",

         "abstract": "Motivated by recent event studies and modeling efforts on pulsating aurora, which conclude that the precipitation energy during these events is high enough to cause significant chemical changes in the mesosphere, this study looks for the bulk behavior of auroral pulsations. Based on about 400 pulsating aurora events, we outline the typical duration, geomagnetic conditions, and change in the peak emission height for the events. We show that the auroral peak emission height for both green and blue emission decreases by about 8 km at the start of the pulsating aurora interval. This brings the hardest 10% of the electrons down to about 90 km altitude. The median duration of pulsating aurora is about 1.4 h. This value is a conservative estimate since in many cases the end of event is limited by the end of auroral imaging for the night or the aurora drifting out of the camera field of view. The longest durations of auroral pulsations are observed during events which start within the substorm recovery phases. As a result, the geomagnetic indices are not able to describe pulsating aurora. Simultaneous Antarctic auroral images were found for 10 pulsating aurora events. In eight cases auroral pulsations were seen in the southern hemispheric data as well, suggesting an equatorial precipitation source and a frequent interhemispheric occurrence. The long lifetimes of pulsating aurora, their interhemispheric occurrence, and the relatively high-precipitation energies make this type of aurora an effective energy deposition process which is easy to identify from the ground-based image data.",

         "abstract": "This paper describes highly interesting observations of the 25 December 2015 substorm onset at 08:17 UT during northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) while magnetosheath contained several intervals of negative B<SUB>z</SUB>. A unique alignment of several spacecraft near the Earth-Sun line together with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, ground-based magnetometer, and auroral observations allow a comprehensive timing analysis of the events leading to substorm onset. Perplexingly, prior to substorm onset Geotail measured for 26 min positive IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> just upstream of the bow shock, while simultaneously MMS spacecraft measured several intervals of strong negative B<SUB>z</SUB> in the dayside magnetosheath. These strong pulses of negative B<SUB>z</SUB> in the magnetosheath were associated with high dynamic pressure magnetosheath jets, likely created by foreshock transients during strongly radial IMF interval. Multipoint plasma and magnetic field measurements from ARTEMIS and THEMIS spacecraft were used to determine tail reconnection time at 8:14 and location at x=-33R<SUB>E</SUB>. Ground-based observations of Pi2 pulsations and auroral brightening, with observations of a dipolarization front by THEMIS spacecraft, allowed determination of substorm onset to be at \u224808:17. All MMS spacecraft detected the same magnetosheath jet structure with B<SUB>z</SUB>=-25 nT at \u223c08:00 while IMF was northward. Based on DMSP observations and timing analysis we propose that these jets produced magnetopause reconnection leading to final, critical flux enhancement in the midtail region, which may have triggered reconnection 12-14 min later after jet observations.",

         "abstract": "The foreshock region involves localized and transient structures such as foreshock cavities and hot flow anomalies due to solar wind-bow shock interactions, and foreshock transients have been shown to lead to magnetospheric and ionospheric responses. In this paper, the interaction between a foreshock transient and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system is investigated using dayside aurora imagers revealing structures and propagation in greater detail than previously possible. A foreshock transient was detected by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms B and C during 1535-1545 UT on 25 June 2008. Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms A, D, and E observed magnetopause compression, cold plasma enhancement, and ultralow frequency waves in the dayside magnetosphere. The all-sky imager at South Pole observed that both diffuse and discrete aurora brightened locally soon after the appearance of this foreshock transient. The diffuse aurora brightening, which corresponded to a region a few Re size in geocentric solar magnetospheric Y in the equatorial plane, propagated duskward with an average speed of 100 km/s. Soon after the diffuse aurora brightened, discrete aurora also brightened and extended duskward, which was consistent with the motion of the foreshock transient as it swept through the magnetosheath while impacting the magnetopause. Equivalent horizontal currents measured by magnetometers revealed a pair of field-aligned currents moving duskward consistent with motion of the discrete aurora patterns. We conclude that the high-resolution and two-dimensional observation of auroral responses by ground-based all-sky imager can help to estimate the evolution and propagation of upstream foreshock transients and their substantial impacts on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system, including magnetospheric compression and currents in the ionosphere.",

(&lt;link href=\"#jgra53482-bib-0076\"/&gt;). Simulations with GW effects cut off above the turbopause and included in the entire thermosphere have been conducted. GWs appreciably impact the mean circulation and cool the thermosphere down by up to 12-18%. GWs significantly affect the winds modulated by the diurnal migrating tide, in particular, in the low-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the high-latitude thermosphere. These effects depend on the mutual correlation of the diurnal phases of the GW forcing and tides: GWs can either enhance or reduce the tidal amplitude. In the low-latitude MLT, the correlation between the direction of the deposited GW momentum and the tidal phase is positive due to propagation of a broad spectrum of GW harmonics through the alternating winds. In the Northern Hemisphere high-latitude thermosphere, GWs act against the tide due to an anticorrelation of tidal wind and GW momentum, while in the Southern high-latitudes they weakly enhance the tidal amplitude via a combination of a partial correlation of phases and GW-induced changes of the circulation. The variable nature of GW effects on the thermal tide can be captured in GCMs provided that a GW parameterization (1) considers a broad spectrum of harmonics, (2) properly describes their propagation, and (3) correctly accounts for the physics of wave breaking/saturation.",

         "abstract": "The observations made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft in the topside (\u2265200 km) ionosphere of Mars show that this region is very responsive to the variations of the external (solar extreme ultraviolet flux, solar wind, and interplanetary magnetic field [IMF]) and internal (the crustal magnetic field) drivers. With the growth of the solar irradiance the ionosphere broadens while with increase of the solar wind dynamic pressure it shrinks. As a result, the upper ionospheric boundary at solar zenith angles of 60-70\u00b0 can move from \u223c400 to \u223c1,200 km. Similar trends are observed at the nightside ionosphere. At P<SUB>dyn</SUB> \u2265 1-2 nPa the nightside ionosphere becomes very fragmented and depleted. On the other hand, the ion density in the nightside ionosphere significantly (up to a factor of 10) increases with the rise of the solar extreme ultraviolet flux. Large-amplitude motions of the topside ionosphere also occur with variations of the value of the cross-flow component of the IMF. The upper dayside ionosphere at altitudes of more than 300-400 km is sensitive also to the direction of the cross-flow component of the IMF or, correspondingly, to the direction of the motional electric field in the solar wind. The ionosphere becomes very asymmetrical with respect to the V<SUB>sw</SUB>\u00d7B<SUB>IMF</SUB> direction and the asymmetry strongly enhances at the nightside. The topside ionosphere above the areas with strong crustal magnetic field in the dayside southern hemisphere is significantly denser and expands to higher altitudes as compared to the ionosphere above the northern nonmagnetized lowlands. The crustal magnetic field also protects the nightside ionosphere from being filled by plasma transported from the dayside. The draping IMF penetrates deeply into the ionosphere and actively influences its structure. Weak fields and, correspondingly, weak magnetic field forces only slightly affect the ionosphere. With increase of the induced magnetic field strength the transport motions driven by the magnetic field pressure and field tensions seem to be intensified and we observe that the local ion densities at the dayside considerably decrease. A different trend is observed at the nightside. The ion density in the nightside ionosphere above the northern lowlands is higher than in the southern hemisphere indicating that plasma transport from the dayside is the main source of the nightside ionosphere. Nonstop variations in the solar wind, the IMF and the solar irradiance together with planetary rotation of the crustal magnetic field sources lead to a continuous expansion/shrinking and reconfiguration of the topside ionosphere of Mars.",

During substorms, the magnetic field on the nightside is first stretched in the antisunward direction and then it rapidly contracts earthward bringing hot plasmas from the distant space regions into the inner magnetosphere, where they contribute to geomagnetic storms and Joule dissipation in the polar ionosphere, causing impressive splashes of aurora. Here we show for the first time that mining millions of spaceborne magnetometer data records from multiple missions allows one to reconstruct the global 3-D picture of these stretching and dipolarization processes. Stretching results in the formation of a thin (less than the Earth's radius) and strong current sheet, which is diverted into the ionosphere during dipolarization. In the meantime, the dipolarization signal propagates further into the inner magnetosphere resulting in the accumulation of a longer lived current there, giving rise to a protogeomagnetic storm. The global 3-D structure of the corresponding substorm currents including the substorm current wedge is reconstructed from data.",

         "abstract": "Magnetosheath high-speed jets (HSJs) are dayside upstream transient disturbances with enhanced flow velocity and dynamic pressure. They are associated with significant magnetopause perturbations, ultralow frequency waves in the dayside magnetosphere, and localized flow enhancements in the ionosphere. However, whether HSJs have corresponding dayside aurora signatures is still an open question. If auroral signatures are found, 2-D structure and evolution of HSJ effects on the magnetosphere can be imaged in a much higher precision than possible by other means. In this study, eight HSJ events are identified by the THEMIS satellites located within \u00b11 MLT of the center of the field-of-view of the South Pole station all-sky imager. In all of those cases, the HSJs are observed to have a nearly one-to-one relationship with individual localized discrete/diffuse auroral brightenings. The azimuthal size of HSJ-related diffuse aurora signatures is 800 km at 230-km altitude in the ionosphere and 3.7 Re in the magnetosphere, which is slightly larger but of the order of the cross-sectional diameter of HSJs ( 1 Re). Furthermore, most of those aurora signatures have azimuthal motion, whose magnitude and direction agree with magnetosheath background flows. This study for the first time shows high-resolution, two-dimensional observations of localized structure and fast propagation of precipitation due to magnetosheath HSJs. We conclude that magnetosheath HSJs can have substantial impacts on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system, causing localized magnetospheric compression and aurora brightening, in a similar manner to responses during interplanetary shocks except with a smaller scale size.",

         "abstract": "The subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) are one of the most important features in representing magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art modeling framework that couples an inner magnetospheric ring current model RAM-SCB with a global MHD model Block-Adaptive Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and an ionospheric potential solver to study the SAPS that occurred during the 17 March 2013 storm event as well as to assess the modeling capability. Both ionospheric and magnetospheric signatures associated with SAPS are analyzed to understand the spatial and temporal evolution of the electrodynamics in the midlatitude regions. Results show that the model captures the SAPS at subauroral latitudes, where Region 2 field-aligned currents (FACs) flow down to the ionosphere and the conductance is lower than in the higher-latitude auroral zone. Comparisons to observations such as FACs observed by Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), cross-track ion drift from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and in situ electric field observations from the Van Allen Probes indicate that the model generally reproduces the global dynamics of the Region 2 FACs, the position of SAPS along the DMSP, and the location of the SAPS electric field around L of 3.0 in the inner magnetosphere near the equator. The model also demonstrates double westward flow channels in the dusk sector (the higher-latitude auroral convection and the subauroral SAPS) and captures the mechanism of the SAPS. However, the comparison with ion drifts along DMSP trajectories shows an underestimate of the magnitude of the SAPS and the sensitivity to the specific location and time. The comparison of the SAPS electric field with that measured from the Van Allen Probes shows that the simulated SAPS electric field penetrates deeper than in reality, implying that the shielding from the Region 2 FACs in the model is not well represented. Possible solutions in future studies to improve the modeling capability include implementing a self-consistent ionospheric conductivity module from inner magnetosphere particle precipitation, coupling with the thermosphere-ionosphere chemical processes, and connecting the ionosphere with the inner magnetosphere by the stronger Region 2 FACs calculated in the inner magnetosphere model.",

         "abstract": "Changes in the thermosphere-ionosphere system caused by high-speed streams in the solar wind, and the co-rotating interaction regions they engender, are studied using a combination of model simulations and data analysis. The magnetospheric responses to these structures and consequent ionospheric drivers are simulated using the numerical Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere model and the empirical Weimer 2005 model, finding that the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is more important than solar wind speed and density per se in controlling magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is then employed to calculate neutral density, nitric oxide cooling, and electron density, for comparison to space-based measurements from the STAR instrument on the CHAMP satellite, the SABER instrument on the TIMED satellite, and GPS occultations from the COSMIC mission, respectively. The recurrent, periodic changes observed under solar minimum conditions during 2008, and particularly during the Whole Heliospheric Interval (March-April of 2008), are simulated by the model and compared to these measurements. Numerical experiments were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of solar wind and IMF forcing, setting the solar wind speed and density to nominal values, smoothing the IMF, and also setting it to zero. The results confirm the importance of IMF variations, particularly its north-south component (B<SUB>z</SUB>), but also show that when the average B<SUB>z</SUB> values are negative (southward), the interaction with increased solar wind speed amplifies the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere response. Conversely, during events when B<SUB>z</SUB> is on average positive (northward), even large increases in solar wind speed have small effects on the system.",

Plasma pressure is the source of global storm time currents, which control the distribution of magnetic field and couple the inner magnetosphere and the ionosphere. Recent analysis showed that the buildup of hot ion population in the inner magnetosphere largely occurs in the form of localized discrete injections associated with sharp dipolarizations of magnetic field, similar to dipolarization fronts in the magnetotail. Because of significant differences between the ambient magnetic field and the dipolarization front properties in the magnetotail and the inner magnetosphere, the physical mechanisms of ion acceleration at dipolarization fronts in these two regions may also be different. In this paper we discuss a new acceleration mechanism enabled by stable trapping of ions at the azimuthally localized dipolarization fronts. It is shown that trapping can provide a robust mechanism of ion energization in the inner magnetosphere even in the absence of large electric fields.",

         "abstract": "When a magnetosheath jet (localized dynamic pressure enhancements) compresses ambient magnetosheath at a (relative) speed faster than the local magnetosonic speed, a bow wave or shock can form ahead of the jet. Such bow waves or shocks were recently observed to accelerate particles, thus contributing to magnetosheath heating and particle acceleration in the extended environment of Earth's bow shock. To further understand the characteristics of jet-driven bow waves, we perform a statistical study to examine which solar wind conditions favor their formation and whether it is common for them to accelerate particles. We identified 364 out of 2,859 (~13%) magnetosheath jets to have a bow wave or shock ahead of them with Mach number typically larger than 1.1. We show that large solar wind plasma beta, weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, large solar wind Alfv\u00e9n Mach number, and strong solar wind dynamic pressure present favorable conditions for their formation. We also show that magnetosheath jets with bow waves or shocks are more frequently associated with higher maximum ion and electron energies than those without them, confirming that it is common for these structures to accelerate particles. In particular, magnetosheath jets with bow waves have electron energy flux enhanced on average by a factor of 2 compared to both those without bow waves and the ambient magnetosheath. Our study implies that magnetosheath jets can contribute to shock acceleration of particles especially for high Mach number shocks. Therefore, shock models should be generalized to include magnetosheath jets and concomitant particle acceleration.",

         "abstract": "Observations by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft (MMS) of an unusual layer, located between the dayside magnetosheath and the magnetosphere, alternating with encounters with the magnetosheath during an extended time period between December 31, 2015 and January 01, 2016, when the interplanetary magnetic field was strongly southward and the Earth's dipole tilt large and negative, are presented. It appears to have been magnetically connected to both magnetosphere and magnetosheath. The layer appears to be located mostly on closed field lines and was bounded by a rotational discontinuity (RD) at its magnetosheath edge and by the magnetosphere on its earthward side. A separatrix layer, with heated magnetosheath electrons streaming unidirectionally along the field lines, was present sunward of the RD. We infer that the layer was started by a dominant reconnection site well north of the spacecraft and that it may have gained additional width, from a large drop in solar wind density and ram pressure, which preceded the beginning of the event by more than an hour. Relative to the magnetosheath, in which the magnetic field was strongly southward, this unusual layer was characterized by a less southward, more dawnward magnetic field of lower magnitude. The plasma density and flow speed in the region were lower than in the magnetosheath, albeit with Alfv\u00e9nic jetting occurring at the magnetosheath edge as well as at the magnetospheric edge of the layer. The closing of the magnetic field lines requires the existence of another reconnection site, located southward/tailward of MMS.",

         "abstract": "Pulsating aurora is a common phenomenon generally believed to occur mainly in the aftermath of a substorm, where dim long-period pulsating patches appear. The study determines the temporal and spatial evolution of pulsating events using two THEMIS all-sky imager stations, at Gillam (66.18 magnetic latitude, 332.78 magnetic longitude, magnetic midnight at 0634 UT) and Fort Smith, (67.38 magnetic latitude, 306.64 magnetic longitude, magnetic midnight at 0806 UT) along roughly the same invariant latitude. Parameters have been calculated from a database of 74 pulsating aurora events from 119 days of good optical data within the period from September 2007 through March 2008 as identified with the Gillam camera. It is shown that the source region of pulsating aurora drifts or expands eastward, away from magnetic midnight, for premidnight onsets and that the spatial evolution is more complicated for postmidnight onsets, which has implications for the source mechanism. The most probable duration of a pulsating aurora event is roughly 1.5 h, while the distribution of possible event durations includes many long (several hours) events. This may suggest that pulsating aurora is not strictly a substorm recovery phase phenomenon but rather a persistent, long-lived phenomenon that may be temporarily disrupted by auroral substorms. Observations from the Gillam station show that in fact, pulsating aurora is quite common with the occurrence rate increasing to around 60% for morning hours, with 69% of pulsating aurora onsets occurring after substorm breakup.",

         "abstract": "We present the first statistical study of loading and unloading of magnetic flux in Mercury's magnetotail. These events describe the global circulation of magnetic flux through the magnetosphere and provide strong evidence that terrestrial-type substorms take place at Mercury. 438 events were identified over the 4 years of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission by a gradual, short-lived increase in the magnetotail lobe magnetic field strength, coincident with an outward flaring of the magnetotail. Substorm duration ranged from tens of seconds to several minutes, with a median of 195 s and a mean of 212 s. The median amplitude of lobe magnetic field increase was 11.5 nT, which represents an increase of 23.4% on the background lobe field strength, compared with 10% for terrestrial substorms. The magnetotail lobes were found to contain 2-3 MWb of magnetic flux based on 1031 tail passes, with a mean of 2.52 MWb and a standard deviation of 0.48 MWb. An estimate of the change in open flux content during the loading phase of each substorm ranged from 0.08 to 3.7 MWb with a mean value of 0.69 MWb and a standard deviation of 0.38 MWb. These changes in open flux content are an underestimate as the change in magnetotail radius during the events was not accounted for. The maximum lobe flux content during each substorm ( 3 MWb) represented 40% of the total available magnetic flux in the system ( 7.5 MWb). During terrestrial substorms, the maximum lobe magnetic flux content is 10-12% of the total flux from the dipole. A typical substorm at Mercury therefore cycles through a significantly larger fraction of the available magnetic flux than all but the largest substorms at the Earth.",

Both the COSMIC observations and TIME-GCM simulations reveal perturbations in the &lt;fi&gt;F&lt;/fi&gt; region peak height (h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) at Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes during SSW time periods. The perturbations are \u223c20-30 km, which corresponds to 10-20% variability of the background mean h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>. The TIME-GCM simulations and COSMIC observations of the h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability are in overall good agreement, and the simulations can thus be used to understand the physical processes responsible for the h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability. Through comparison of simulations with and without the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M<SUB>2</SUB>), we conclude that the midlatitude h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability is primarily driven by the propagation of the M<SUB>2</SUB> into the thermosphere where it modulates the field-aligned neutral winds, which in turn raise and lower the &lt;fi&gt;F&lt;/fi&gt; region peak height. Though there are subtle differences, the consistency of the behavior between the 2009 and 2013 SSWs suggests that variability in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude ionosphere and thermosphere is a consistent feature of the SSW impact on the upper atmosphere.",

An ensemble Kalman filter software developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), called Data Assimilation Research Testbed, is applied to assimilate ground-based GPS total electron content (TEC) observations into a theoretical numerical model of the thermosphere and ionosphere (NCAR thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model) during the 26 September 2011 geomagnetic storm period. Effects of various assimilation-forecast cycle lengths: 60, 30, and 10 min on the ionospheric forecast are examined by using the global root-mean-squared observation-minus-forecast (OmF) TEC residuals. Substantial reduction in the global OmF for the 10 min assimilation-forecast cycling suggests that a rapid cycling ionospheric data assimilation system can greatly improve the quality of the model forecast during geomagnetic storm conditions. Furthermore, updating the thermospheric state variables in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere forecast model in the assimilation step is an important factor in improving the trajectory of model forecasting. The shorter assimilation-forecast cycling (10 min in this paper) helps to restrain unrealistic model error growth during the forecast step due to the imbalance among model state variables resulting from an inadequate state update, which in turn leads to a greater forecast accuracy.",

         "abstract": "The diffuse aurora has recently been shown to be a major contributor of energy flux into the Earth's ionosphere. Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is required to understand its role in energy redistribution in the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In previous theoretical descriptions of precipitated magnetospheric electrons (E\u223c 1 keV), the major focus has been the ionization and excitation rates of the neutral atmosphere and the energy deposition rate to thermal ionospheric electrons. However, these precipitating electrons will also produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. This paper presents the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E&lt; 600 eV) and their ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling processes. In this article, we discuss for the first time how diffuse electron precipitation into the atmosphere and the associated secondary electron production participate in ionosphere-magnetosphere energy redistribution.",

         "abstract": "Magnetospheric substorms represent a major energy release process in Earth's magnetosphere. Their duration and intensity are coupled to solar wind input, but the precise way the solar wind energy is stored and then released is a matter of considerable debate. Part of the observational difficulty has been the gaps in the auroral electrojet index traditionally used to study substorm properties. In this study, we created a midlatitude positive bay (MPB) index to measure the strength of the substorm current wedge. Because this index is based on midlatitude magnetometer data that are available continuously over several decades, we can assemble a database of substorm onsets lasting 31 years (1982-2012). We confirmed that the MPB onsets have a good agreement (\u00b12 min) with auroral onsets as determined by optical means on board the IMAGE mission and that the MPB signature of substorms is robust and independent of the stations' position relative to ionospheric currents. Using the MPB onset, expansion, and recovery as a proxy of the respective substorm quantities, we found that the solar cycle variation of substorm occurrence depends on solar wind conditions and has a most probable value of 80 min. In contrast, the durations of substorm expansion and recovery phases do not change with the solar cycle. This suggests that the frequency of energy unloading in the magnetosphere is controlled by solar wind conditions through dayside reconnection, but the unloading process related to flux pileup in the near-Earth region is controlled by the magnetosphere and independent of external driving.",

         "abstract": "The precipitation of high-energy magnetospheric electrons (E \u223c 600 eV-10 KeV) in the diffuse aurora contributes significant energy flux into the Earth's ionosphere. To fully understand the formation of this flux at the upper ionospheric boundary, \u223c700-800 km, it is important to consider the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In the diffuse aurora, precipitating electrons initially injected from the plasma sheet via wave-particle interaction processes degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These precipitating electrons can be additionally reflected upward from the two conjugate ionospheres, leading to a series of multiple reflections through the magnetosphere. These reflections greatly influence the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km) and the resultant population of secondary electrons and electrons cascading toward lower energies. In this paper, we present the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E &lt; 600 eV) and its energy interplay in the magnetosphere and two conjugated ionospheres. This solution takes into account, for the first time, the formation of the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region, beginning with the primary injection of plasma sheet electrons via both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves and whistler mode chorus waves to the loss cone, and including their subsequent multiple atmospheric reflections in the two magnetically conjugated ionospheres. It is demonstrated that magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is key in forming the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region.",

         "abstract": "Observations of a pulsating aurora event occurring on 11 February 2008, using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) All-Sky Imager (ASI) array, indicate a spatially and temporally continuous event with a duration of greater than 15 h and covering a region with a maximum size of greater than 10 h magnetic local time. The optical pulsations are at times locally interrupted or drowned out by auroral substorm activity but are observed in the same location once the discrete aurora recedes. The pulsations following the auroral breakup appear to be brighter and have a larger patch size than before breakup. This suggests that, while the onset of pulsating aurora is not necessarily dependent upon a substorm precursor, the pulsations are affected and possibly enhanced by the substorm process. The long duration of this pulsating aurora event, lasting approximately 8 h without interruption as imaged from Gillam station, is significantly longer than the typical 2-3 h substorm recovery phase, suggesting that pulsating aurora is not strictly a recovery phase phenomenon. This paper is accompanied by a movie of the THEMIS ASI array data, from 0000 to 1715 UT, plotted in mosaic and superimposed onto a map of North America.",

         "abstract": "The extreme substorm event on 5 April 2010 (THEMIS AL = -2,700 nT, called supersubstorm) was investigated to examine its driving processes, the aurora current system responsible for the supersubstorm, and the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T) responses. An interplanetary shock created shock aurora, but the shock was not a direct driver of the supersubstorm onset. Instead, the shock with a large southward IMF strengthened the growth phase with substantially larger ionosphere currents, more rapid equatorward motion of the auroral oval, larger ionosphere conductance, and more elevated magnetotail pressure than those for the growth phase of classical substorms. The auroral brightening at the supersubstorm onset was small, but the expansion phase had multistep enhancements of unusually large auroral brightenings and electrojets. The largest activity was an extremely large poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and subsequent auroral streamer, which started ~20 min after the substorm auroral onset during a steady southward IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> and elevated dynamic pressure. Those were associated with a substorm current wedge (SCW), plasma sheet flow, relativistic particle injection and precipitation down to the D-region, total electron content (TEC), conductance, and neutral wind in the thermosphere, all of which were unusually large compared to classical substorms. The SCW did not extend over the entire nightside auroral activity but was localized azimuthally to a few 100 km in the ionosphere around the PBI and streamer. These results reveal the importance of localized magnetotail reconnection for releasing large energy accumulation that can affect geosynchronous satellites and produce the extreme M-I-T responses.",

We study the response of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system to a 25% reduction in magnetic field intensity, using the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (CMIT) model. Simulations were performed with a dipole moment of 8 \u00d7 10<SUP>22</SUP> A m<SUP>2</SUP>, close to the present-day value, and a dipole moment of 6 \u00d7 10<SUP>22</SUP> A m<SUP>2</SUP>, both under the same solar wind conditions, intermediate solar activity (F10.7 = 150), and for March equinox and June solstice. The 25% reduction in field strength causes the magnetosphere to shrink and the polar cap to expand, in agreement with theory. The Pedersen and the Hall ionospheric conductances increase by 50%-60% and 60%-65%, respectively. This causes a \u223c9%-12% decrease in electric potential and a \u223c20% increase in field-aligned currents during equinox. Ion E \u00d7 B drift velocities are enhanced by \u223c10%-15%. The Joule heating also increases, by 13%-30%, depending on the season. Changes in the neutral temperature structure are caused partly by changes in Joule heating and partly by changes in the neutral wind. The neutral wind itself is also affected by changes in neutral temperature and by changes in ion velocities. The changes in the neutral wind, together with changes in the vertical component of the E \u00d7 B drift, affect the height of the ionospheric F2 layer. Changes in electron density are related to changes in the O/N<SUB>2</SUB> ratio. The global mean increase in neutral temperature causes the thermosphere to expand, resulting in a global mean uplift of the ionosphere. These effects are generally smaller during solstice.",

         "abstract": "fast flows that impinge on the inner magnetosphere from the plasma sheet are observed to oscillate on time scales of minutes. The compression ahead of these flows will launch fast mode waves, while the velocity shears at the edges of these flows directly excite shear Alfv\u00e9n waves. These waves, which are coupled by gradients in the Alfv\u00e9n speed, have been suggested as a source for the Pi1 and Pi2 waves that are observed at both high and low latitudes in the ionosphere. A new three-dimensional simulation of the propagation of ULF waves in the dipolar region of the magnetosphere has been developed to study these coupled wave modes. This model includes a height-resolved ionospheric conductivity so that ionospheric fields can be more realistically determined, as well as a direct calculation of ground magnetic fields to compare with ground magnetometers using an inductive ionosphere model. Results from this model show that a plasmaspheric resonance can be set up by waves with periods about 1 min and that field line resonances can be excited both inside and outside the plasmasphere. The use of the inductive ionosphere model leads to the conclusion that even a uniform Hall conductivity can break the dawn-dusk symmetry of the convection pattern. Waves from a source at 10 Earth radii reach the ionosphere with time delays between high and low latitudes of tens of seconds, with implications for the timing of substorm phenomena observed by spacecraft and by ground magnetometers and radars.",

         "abstract": "The ionization of neutral material ejected by Jupiter's volcanically active moon, Io, results in a plasma disc that extends from Io's orbit out through the Jovian magnetosphere. This magnetospheric plasma is coupled to the planetary ionosphere via currents which flow along the magnetic field. Inside of \u223c40 R<SUB>J</SUB>, these currents transfer angular momentum from the planet to the magnetospheric plasma, in an attempt to keep the plasma rigidly corotating with the planet. Jupiter's main auroral emission is a signature of this current system. To date, one-dimensional models of Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling have either assumed a dipole field or used a field description appropriate to the postmidnight region of the Jovian magnetosphere. Vogt et al. (2011) described the variation of the N-S component of the magnetic field in the center of the current sheet, B<SUB>N</SUB>, with local time and radius. We apply a 1-D model of Jupiter's M-I current system every hour in local time using a modified description of the Vogt et al. (2011) magnetic field to investigate how local time variations in the magnetosphere affect the auroral currents and plasma angular velocity. Our model predicts the strongest aurora at dawn, with a minimum in the auroral currents existing from noon through dusk. This is a few hours duskward of the discontinuity predicted by Radioti et al. (2008). While our model predictions are consistent with some of the observations, future MI coupling models must account for the azimuthal bendback in the magnetic field.",

The atmospheric reanalysis is based on implementation of data assimilation in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. The tidal variability in the WACCM+DART reanalysis is compared to the observed variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) based on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics satellite Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (TIMED/SABER) observations, in the ionosphere based on Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations, and in the upper thermosphere (\u223c475 km) based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density observations. To obtain the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT and upper thermosphere, we apply the method of tidal deconvolution to the TIMED/SABER observations and consider the difference in the ascending and descending longitudinal wave number 4 structure in the GRACE observations. The results reveal that tidal amplitude changes of 5-10 K regularly occur on short timescales (\u223c10-20 days) in the MLT. Similar variability occurs in the WACCM+DART reanalysis and TIMED/SABER observations, demonstrating that the short-term variability can be captured in whole atmosphere models that employ data assimilation and in observations by the technique of tidal deconvolution. The impact of the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT on the ionosphere and thermosphere is also clearly evident in the COSMIC and GRACE observations. Analysis of the troposphere forcing in WACCM+DART and simulations of the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) show that the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT is not related to a single source; rather, it is due to a combination of changes in troposphere forcing, zonal mean atmosphere, and wave-wave interactions.",

The present study investigates the source of the global N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> decrease by performing numerical experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model. The simulations reveal that the N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> reduction coincides with a depletion of thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], indicating that the N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> depletion is related to changes in thermospheric composition during SSWs. Numerical experiments further illustrate that the short-term (\u223c10 day) enhancement of the migrating semidiurnal solar tide (SW2) during SSWs is the source of the variability in thermospheric composition. In particular, the enhancement of the SW2 during SSWs alters the lower thermosphere zonal mean circulation, leading to a reduction in atomic oxygen in the lower thermosphere. The atomic oxygen reduction propagates into the upper thermosphere through molecular diffusion, leading to a decrease in [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>] throughout the low- to middle-latitude thermosphere. It is anticipated that the effects of the SW2 on the ionosphere and thermosphere investigated herein will be modulated by SSW related enhancements of the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M2). The magnitude of the combined impact of the SW2 and M2 on the ionosphere-thermosphere mean state will depend on the relative phasing of the solar and lunar tides. The results demonstrate that in addition to modulating the low-latitude electrodynamics, tidal variability during SSWs can significantly impact the mean state of the ionosphere and thermosphere.",

These recently discovered neutral metal layers in the thermosphere between 100 and 200 km provide unique tracers for studies of fundamental processes in the space-atmosphere interaction region. The TIFe model formulates and expands the TIFe theory originally proposed by Chu et al. that the thermospheric Fe layers are produced through the neutralization of converged Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers. Through testing mechanisms and reproducing the 28 May 2011 event at McMurdo, we conceive the lifecycle of meteoric metals via deposition, transport, chemistry, and wave dynamics for thermospheric Fe layers with gravity wave signatures. While the meteor injection of iron species is negligible above 120 km, the polar electric field transports metallic ions Fe<SUP>+</SUP> upward from their main deposition region into the E-F regions, providing the major source of Fe<SUP>+</SUP> (and accordingly Fe) in the thermosphere. Atmospheric wave-induced vertical shears of vertical and horizontal winds converge Fe<SUP>+</SUP> to form dense Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers. Direct electron-Fe<SUP>+</SUP> recombination is the major channel to neutralize Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers to form Fe above 120 km. Fe layer shapes are determined by multiple factors of neutral winds, electric field, and aurora activity. Gravity-wave-induced vertical wind plays a key role in forming gravity-wave-shaped Fe layers.

Furthermore, these neutral metal layers provide tracers for direct measurements of the neutral properties in the least understood but crucially important space-atmosphere interaction region in the altitude range of 100-200 km. With a thermosphere-ionosphere Fe/Fe<SUP>+</SUP> (TIFe) model developed from first principles at the University of Colorado, we present the first quantitative investigation of formation mechanisms of thermospheric Fe layers observed by lidar in Antarctica. The TIFe model formulates the TIFe theory depicting the lifecycle of meteoric metals via deposition, transport, chemistry, and wave dynamics. Antarctic lidar observations were successfully reproduced with the TIFe model simulations. These TIFe layers provide a unique natural laboratory for understanding the fundamental processes critical to advancing the research of space-atmosphere interactions.",

The anisotropic pressure of draped magnetosheath magnetic field lines and the inclusion of a reconnection-generated standing slow mode wave fan bounded by a rotational discontinuity within the definition of the magnetotail result in cross sections elongated in the direction parallel to the component of the IMF in the plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line. Tilted cross-tail plasma sheets separate the northern and southern lobes within these cross sections. Greater fast-mode speeds perpendicular than parallel to the draped magnetosheath magnetic field lines result in greater distances to the bow shock in the direction perpendicular than parallel to the component of the IMF in the plane transverse to the Sun-Earth line. The magnetotail cross section responds rapidly to variations in the IMF orientation. The rotational discontinuity associated with newly reconnected magnetic field lines requires no more than the magnetosheath convection time to appear at any distance downstream, and further adjustments of the cross section in response to the anisotropic pressures of the draped magnetic field lines require no more than 10-20 min. Consequently, for typical ecliptic IMF orientations and strengths, the magnetotail cross section is oblate, while the bow shock is prolate.",

         "abstract": "evaluate whether ground magnetic responses traditionally viewed as signatures of substorm onset may be related to postonset auroral streamers rather than to substorm onset seen in aurora, we have analyzed ground magnetic and all-sky image responses for 14 substorm onsets selected solely on imager coverage. We find evidence supporting this possibility, the response being approximately coincident for midlatitude positive bay and Pi2 pulsation enhancements and for abrupt auroral zone H decreases at stations near a streamer. These are all signatures of current wedge formation, indicating that substorm current wedge formation may be more of a response to plasma sheet flow channels associated with postonset streamers than to the process leading to auroral onset and that the current wedge may develop via a series of distinctly narrower wedge-like structures. We also find evidence that periods of streamers can occur more than once during a substorm expansion phase and can give magnetic signatures of multiple onsets even if there are no additional auroral onsets. Furthermore, the peak auroral zone H decreases are seen in association with streamers and at times varying from just a few minutes to well over a half hour after substorm auroral onset if there is a prolonged period of streamers. This indicates that peak substorm AE and AL values are likely related to features of postonset streamers and their locations relative to observing stations and are not a measure of the strength of the substorm auroral onset processes. We discuss possible additional implications on substorm expansion phase development.",

The jets were identified as dense and fast streams of the magnetosheath plasma whose energy density is higher than that of the upstream solar wind. The jet interaction with the magnetopause was revealed from sudden inward motion of the magnetopause and an enhancement in the geomagnetic field. The penetration was determined as appearance of the magnetosheath plasma against the background of the hot magnetospheric particle population. We found that almost 60% of the jets penetrated through the magnetopause. Vast majority of the penetrating jets was characterized by high velocities V &gt; 220 km/s and kinetic \u03b2<SUB>k</SUB> &gt; 1 that corresponded to a combination of finite Larmor radius effect with a mechanism of impulsive penetration. The average plasma flux in the penetrating jets was found to be 1.5 times larger than the average plasma flux of the solar wind. The average rate of jet-related penetration of the magnetosheath plasma into the dayside magnetosphere was estimated to be ~10<SUP>29</SUP> particles/d. The rate varies highly with time and can achieve values of 1.5 \u00d7 10<SUP>29</SUP> particles/h that is comparable with estimates of the total amount of plasma entering the dayside magnetosphere.",

We study the effect of this QTDW-tidal interaction on the ionosphere and thermosphere using the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model. This interaction reduces the amplitude of the migrating diurnal tide in the lower thermosphere by ~10 m/s in neutral winds and also generates sum and difference secondary waves in the lower thermosphere and E region ionosphere. As a result of the changed migrating diurnal tide and sum/difference secondary wave, vertical ion drift varies with local time at different longitudes by ~5 m/s. In addition, the changed migrating diurnal tide also modulates the thermospheric composition (O/N<SUB>2</SUB>). During a QTDW event, the ionosphere F<SUB>2</SUB> region peak electron density (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) is reduced due to the mixing effect of the QTDW dissipation; N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> also shows changes in local time variation due to the QTDW-tidal interaction. The sum and difference secondary waves can cause additional oscillations in vertical ion drift and ionospheric electron densities. The QTDW-tidal interaction is another mechanism by which the QTDW impacts the ionosphere and thermosphere, along with other mechanisms: QTDW modulation of the E region wind dynamo with a period of quasi-2 days and QTDW dissipation induced mixing in the thermosphere.",

         "abstract": "While nightside subauroral proton aurora shows rapid temporal variations, the cause of this variability has rarely been investigated. Using well-coordinated observations by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imagers, THEMIS satellites in the equatorial magnetosphere, and the low-altitude NOAA 17 satellite, we examined the rapid temporal evolution of subauroral proton aurora in the premidnight sector. An isolated proton aurora occurred soon after an auroral poleward boundary intensification that was followed by an auroral streamer reaching the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval. Three THEMIS satellites in the magnetotail detected flow bursts and one of the THEMIS satellites in the outer plasmasphere observed a ring current injection together with electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave intensifications. Proton auroral brightenings occurred multiple times throughout the storm main phase and a majority of those were correlated with auroral streamers reaching the auroral equatorward boundary. This sequence highlights the important role of transient flow bursts and particle injections for plasma transport into the inner magnetosphere and thus reflects a tail-inner magnetospheric interaction process in which transient flow bursts play an important role in injecting ring current ions into the plasmasphere, causing rapid modulation of precipitation and the resultant subauroral proton aurora.",

         "abstract": "Using the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics-general circulation model, we investigate the effect of quasi 2 day wave (QTDW) dissipation on thermospheric composition (O/N<SUB>2</SUB>) and ionospheric electron density during solar minimum. The overall thermospheric and ionospheric changes induced by the QTDW are evaluated by running the model with and without QTDW forcing imposed at the model lower boundary. The dissipation of the westward propagating QTDW in the lower thermosphere causes westward mean wind acceleration and drives a poleward meridional circulation. The circulation induced by the QTDW, as determined by the difference between the mean wind patterns of a run with the QTDW and a base run without the QTDW, enhances the mixing of constituents in the lower thermosphere. Through molecular diffusion, the decrease of the O mixing ratio and the increase of the N<SUB>2</SUB> and O<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios propagate from the lower thermosphere into the upper thermosphere. As a result, the O/N<SUB>2</SUB> ratio near the ionospheric F<SUB>2</SUB> peak is reduced by about 16-20% at low and midlatitudes. This in turn produces an approximately 16-32% depletion in the F<SUB>2</SUB> peak electron density at low and midlatitudes. The simulated decrease of electron density during a QTDW event is in quantitative agreement with published observations. This work suggests a new major pathway for the traveling planetary wave from the lower atmosphere to affect the thermosphere and ionosphere via dissipation and mean wind acceleration.",

         "abstract": "The configuration and stability of an important kinetic plasma structure, the current sheet, determine the efficiency of magnetic energy storage, release, and transport in surrounding plasmas. These properties depend on \u03b2 (the ratio of plasma pressures to magnetic field pressures) and Mach number M (the ratio of bulk velocities to magnetosonic velocities). For the most investigated current sheet, the near-Earth magnetotail current sheet, these parameters fall within a relatively narrow range of values (high \u03b2, low M). To investigate current sheet behavior for a wider range of parameters, we explore current sheets in the magnetotail of Mars using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission observations. We find that low-\u03b2, high-M current sheets are abundant in Mars's magnetotail, but high-\u03b2, low-M current sheets can also be found there. Low-\u03b2 current sheets are nearly force-free, whereas high-M current sheets are balanced by a plasma flow gradient along the tail. We compare current sheet distributions in a (\u03b2,M) space for the Martian magnetotail, the near-Earth magnetotail (using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission), and the distant magnetotail (using Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) mission). We also find that the pressure balance in the Martian magnetotail current sheet can occur by contributions from a wide range of ion species, or, in low beta cases, from field-aligned currents generation of a force-free magnetic field configuration. The Martian magnetotail is a natural &lt;fi&gt;laboratory&lt;/fi&gt; where current sheet of various types can be found and investigated.",

         "abstract": "We conducted model simulations to examine how changes in concentration of radiatively active trace gases in the middle atmosphere affect long-term changes in the upper atmosphere. We focused our model study on the impact of increases in carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), and water vapor (H<SUB>2</SUB>O), and decreases in ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) between 1983 and 2003. We used both the National Center for Atmospheric Research Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model and the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model, global mean version, in this study. The model simulations indicate that CO<SUB>2</SUB> is the main forcing mechanism of long-term changes in the thermsophere, with minor influences from O<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>O. At 400 km altitude, global mean thermospheric neutral density decreased by ~4.5% due to CO<SUB>2</SUB> forcing alone, whereas it decreased by ~4.8% due to the combined forcing from all four gases. O<SUB>3</SUB> depletion caused cooling in the stratosphere and mesosphere (maximum decrease of 0.5 K) due to reduced absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation, but had nearly no cooling effect in the thermosphere. However, due to thermal contraction in the stratosphere and mesosphere, O<SUB>3</SUB> depletion caused a small decrease in thermospheric neutral density of ~0.25%. Increases in both CH<SUB>4</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O may slightly warm the upper mesosphere and thermosphere due to increased chemical heating and absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation.",

         "abstract": "The specific entropy (entropy density) S is examined for the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit and for the energetic electron population in the Earth's magnetotail. The outer electron radiation belt is measured with the SOPA detectors on board six geosynchronous satellites and the energetic electrons of the magnetotail are measured with instrumentation on board 12 Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) with a magnetic field model used to map the GPS orbit to the magnetotail. Density n and temperature T values are determined from relativistic Maxwellian fits to the electron measurements, enabling the specific entropy S to be calculated. For low temperatures the nonrelativstic specific entropy is S = T/n<SUP>2/3</SUP>; for a relativistic Maxwellian distribution a relativistically correct expression for S = S(T,n) is derived and used. The outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit local midnight (n \u223c 3 \u00d7 10<SUP>-4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and T \u223c 140 keV) and the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail (n \u223c 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>-4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and T \u223c 50 keV) statistically have the same specific entropy. Hence the two populations are probably the same. This implies adiabatic transport (1) from the magnetotail to the dipole (where the magnetotail electrons are the source of the outer electron radiation belt) or (2) from the dipole to the magnetotail (where the magnetotail electrons are leakage from the radiation belt).",

         "abstract": "Studies of Saturn's magnetosphere with the Cassini mission have established the importance of Enceladus as the dominant mass source for Saturn's magnetosphere. It is well known that the ionosphere is an important mass source at Earth during periods of intense geomagnetic activity, but lesser attention has been dedicated to study the ionospheric mass source at Saturn. In this paper we describe a case study of data from Saturn's magnetotail, when Cassini was located at \u2243 2200 h Saturn local time at 36 R<SUB>S</SUB> from Saturn. During several entries into the magnetotail lobe, tailward flowing cold electrons and a cold ion beam were observed directly adjacent to the plasma sheet and extending deeper into the lobe. The electrons and ions appear to be dispersed, dropping to lower energies with time. The composition of both the plasma sheet and lobe ions show very low fluxes (sometimes zero within measurement error) of water group ions. The magnetic field has a swept-forward configuration which is atypical for this region, and the total magnetic field strength is larger than expected at this distance from the planet. Ultraviolet auroral observations show a dawn brightening, and upstream heliospheric models suggest that the magnetosphere is being compressed by a region of high solar wind ram pressure. We interpret this event as the observation of ionospheric outflow in Saturn's magnetotail. We estimate a number flux between (2.95 \u00b1 0.43) \u00d7 10<SUP>9</SUP> and (1.43 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>, 1 or about 2 orders of magnitude larger than suggested by steady state MHD models, with a mass source between 1.4 \u00d710<SUP>2</SUP> and 1.1 \u00d710<SUP>3</SUP> kg/s. After considering several configurations for the active atmospheric regions, we consider as most probable the main auroral oval, with associated mass source between 49.7 \u00b113.4 and 239.8 \u00b164.8 kg/s for an average auroral oval, and 10 \u00b14 and 49 \u00b123 kg/s for the specific auroral oval morphology found during this event. It is not clear how much of this mass is trapped within the magnetosphere and how much is lost to the solar wind.",

         "abstract": "It took about 12 h for the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite to fly from the outbound pass to inbound pass of every inner magnetosphere crossing. This provides a unique opportunity to study the nightside-to-dayside evolution of the corotating inner magnetosphere when the outbound pass is in the nighttime while the inbound pass is in the daytime because a flux tube observed on the nightside may be observed again on the dayside in such situation. The differences between the two observations may be caused by the evolution of the flux tube. By analyzing both the passive and active sounding measurements from the IMAGE Radio Plasma Imager, we study two cases concerning this evolution. One, under a quiet geomagnetic condition, shows a typical evolution process during which the plasmapause was observed on both the nightside and the dayside. The other, during the recovery phase of a magnetic storm, shows a different inner magnetospheric structure in which the distinct plasmapause observed on the nightside becomes unidentifiable on the dayside as the density in the nearly empty nightside plasmatrough increases to a level similar to that of the plasmasphere. It is shown that the evolutions of the inner magnetosphere in both cases were primarily controlled by the fast plasma refilling of the flux tubes from the ionosphere as the flux tubes drift from the nightside to the dayside. In the former case the fast refilling was confined inside L = \u223c6.3, while in the latter case the fast refilling extended to at least L = 10. The present observations provide an example for fast refilling as a possible cause of the smooth density transition from the plasmasphere to the subauroral region and demonstrate the importance of the plasmasphere-ionosphere coupling in controlling the structures of the inner magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Field-aligned currents (FACs), also known as Birkeland currents, are the agents by which energy and momentum are transferred to the ionosphere from the magnetosphere and solar wind. This coupling is enhanced at substorm onset through the formation of the substorm current wedge. Using FAC data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment and substorm expansion phase onsets identified using the Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet technique, we examine the Northern Hemisphere FACs in all local time sectors with respect to substorm onset and subdivided by season. Our results show that while there is a strong seasonal dependence on the underlying FACs, the increase in FACs following substorm onset only varies by 10% with season, with substorms increasing the hemispheric FACs by 420 kA on average. Over an hour prior to substorm onset, the dayside currents in the postnoon quadrant increase linearly, whereas the nightside currents show a linear increase starting 20-30 min before onset. After onset, the nightside Region 1, Region 2, and nonlocally closed currents and the SuperMAG AL (SML) index follow the Weimer (1994, https://doi.org/10.1029/93JA02721) model with the same time constants in each season. These results contrast earlier contradictory studies that indicate that substorms are either longer in the summer or decay faster in the summer. Our results imply that, on average, substorm FACs do not change with season but that their relative impact on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system does due to the changes in the underlying currents.",

These pulsations can also be observed at geosynchronous orbit, suggesting that they propagate from (or beyond) geosynchronous orbit to the ionosphere at substorm onset. Independently, investigations have shown that the initial brightening of an arc at subtorm onset is Alfv\u00e9nic in nature (i.e., that the aurora during the initial brightening is wave-driven). These results raise the question of whether Pi1B pulsations might drive Alfv\u00e9nic aurora at substorm onset. In this paper, data from a single event are presented that show Pi1B pulsations observed simultaneously at geosynchronous orbit, by FAST just above the ionosphere and by various ground stations. The event is observed by FAST within a few minutes of the onset of Pi1B pulsations, with an electron signature of the onset arc that is quite characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic aurora, showing that at least a portion of the initial brightening is wave-driven and associating this with the presence of Pi1B pulsations. The implication of this work is that Pi1B pulsations propagate to the ionosphere from beyond geosynchronous orbit and provide the wave power to drive Alfv\u00e9nic aurora at substorm onset, at least for this single, isolated event. The luminosity associated with the Alfv\u00e9nic aurora, however, may only provide a small contribution to the total brightness.",

         "abstract": "Substorms cause significant disturbances in the ionosphere. However, it has not been well understood how the electric field and electrojet in the dayside equatorial ionosphere respond to substorm onset. Previous studies found that the equatorial electric field, after substorm onset, could be eastward or westward. Because the onset of isolated substorms is often related to a northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), the measured total electric field is determined by contributions from both IMF northward turning and substorm onset and is not necessarily the signature of the onset. In order to exclude the effect of IMF northward turning, we analyze the variations of ionospheric electric field and electrojet during storm time substorms when the IMF remains stable. Thus, the ionospheric variations can be identified to be caused solely by substorms. The electric field data are measured by the Jicamarca radar, and the electrojet is derived from magnetometers at Jicamarca and Piura. It is found that substorm onset induces an eastward electric field and electrojet in the dayside equatorial ionosphere when the IMF remains continuously southward across the onset. The equatorial electrojet starts to increase at the onset, reaches a maximum value \u223c30 min after the onset, and then decreases to the pre-onset value \u223c60 min after the onset. Westward electric field and counter-electrojet occur only if the substorm onset is associated with a northward turning of the IMF. It is concluded that the effect of substorm onset on the dayside equatorial ionosphere, without involvement of IMF reorientations, is an enhanced eastward electric field.",

The magnetosphere-ionosphere system falls into an unexpected state under this specific IMF orientation when the solar wind electric field vanishes. The most important features that characterize this state include (1) magnetic reconnections can still occur, which take place at the equatorward of the cusp in one hemisphere, the tailward of the cusp in the other hemisphere, and also in the plasma sheet; (2) significant north-south asymmetry exists in both magnetosphere and ionosphere; (3) the polar ionosphere mainly presents a weak two-cell convection pattern, with the polar cap potential valued at \u223c30 kV; (4) the whole magnetosphere-ionosphere system stays in a very quiet state, and the AL index does not exceed -70 nT; and (5) the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can still be excited at both flanks of the magnetosphere. These results imply the controlling role of the IMF direction between the solar wind and magnetosphere interactions and improve our understanding of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

         "abstract": "Jupiter's thermosphere is \u223c700 K hotter than expected if it were heated only by solar extreme ultraviolet radiation. Other, more effective heat sources are therefore necessary to explain the high observed temperatures \u2265900 K. It has been suggested that heating resulting from the atmospheric interaction with Jupiter's dynamic magnetosphere could account for the excess heat required. However to date, no numerical models have been successful at reproducing Jupiter's hot thermosphere without invoking essentially ad hoc heating mechanisms. Work presented in Yates et al. (2014, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2013.11.009\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2013.11.009</A>) emphasized the importance of incorporating time dependence in magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling when simulating this aspect of the Jovian system. We extend their model (for a single magnetospheric compression or expansion) to simulate the response of thermospheric heating to multiple shocks and rarefactions in the solar wind for the first time. We employ a configurable magnetosphere model coupled to an azimuthally symmetric general circulation model. We compare the response of thermospheric temperatures to these consecutive magnetospheric reconfigurations over a period of 100 Jovian rotations. We find that the thermal structure of our model thermosphere does not respond significantly to such a prolonged period of magnetospheric reconfigurations. Thermospheric mean temperatures increase by a maximum of \u223c15 K throughout our simulation. The high-latitude and high-altitude thermosphere is most influenced by magnetospheric reconfigurations. While this simulation shows that magnetospheric reconfigurations can heat the thermosphere, it also shows the need to consider a more realistic representation of the coupled Jovian system as well as alternate sources of heating not dependent on the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "New mechanisms for imposing planetary wave (PW) variability on the ionosphere-thermosphere system are discovered in numerical experiments conducted with the National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model. First, it is demonstrated that a tidal spectrum modulated at PW periods (3-20 days) entering the ionosphere-thermosphere system near 100 km is responsible for producing \u00b140 m/s and \u00b110-15 K PW period oscillations between 110 and 150 km at low to middle latitudes. The dominant response is broadband and zonally symmetric (i.e., \"S0\") over a range of periods and is attributable to tidal dissipation; essentially, the ionosphere-thermosphere system \"vacillates\" in response to dissipation of the PW-modulated tidal spectrum. In addition, some specific westward propagating PWs such as the quasi-6-day wave are amplified by the presence of the tidal spectrum; the underlying mechanism is hypothesized to be a second-stage nonlinear interaction. The S0 total neutral mass density (\u03c1) response at 325 km consists of PW period fluctuations of order \u00b13-4%, roughly equivalent to the day-to-day variability associated with low-level geomagnetic activity. The variability in \u03c1 over short periods (\u223c&lt; 9 days) correlates with temperature changes, indicating a response of hydrostatic origin. Over longer periods \u03c1 is also controlled by composition and mean molecular mass. While the upper-thermosphere impacts are modest, they do translate to more significant changes in the F region ionosphere.",

In this study, for the first time, we quantitatively investigate the posteclipse response of the global ionosphere and thermosphere system to the recent Great American Solar Eclipse using a high-resolution, global, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics model. It was found that the posteclipse response of the ionosphere and thermosphere is significant and worldwide, which was not expected. Specifically, even 9 hr after the eclipse ended, the globally averaged ionospheric total electron content perturbations were about 0.2 total electron content unit, and the corresponding changes in neutral temperature and winds reached 2 K and 2 m/s. The changes in the global dynamic and energetic processes associated with the solar eclipse contributed to this long-lasting response of the ionosphere and thermosphere during the posteclipse period.",

         "abstract": "A recent statistical study of ULF waves driven by substorm-injected particles observed using Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) found that the phase characteristics of these waves varied depending on where the wave was observed relative to the substorm. Typically, positive azimuthal wave numbers, m, were observed in waves generated to the east of the substorms and negative m to the west. The magnitude of m typically increased with the azimuthal separation between the wave observation and the substorm location. The energies estimated for the driving particles for these 83 wave events were found to be highest when the waves were observed closer to the substorm and lowest farther away. Each of the 83 events studied by James et al. (2013) involved just a single wave observation per substorm. Here a study of three individual substorm events are presented, with associated observations of multiple ULF waves using various different SuperDARN radars. We demonstrate that a single substorm is capable of driving a number of wave events characterized by different azimuthal scale lengths and wave periods, associated with different energies, W, in the driving particle population. We find that similar trends in m and W exist for multiple wave events with a single substorm as was seen in the single wave events of James et al. (2013). The variety of wave periods present on similar L shells in this study may also be evidence for the detection of both poloidal Alfv\u00e9n and drift compressional mode waves driven by substorm-injected particles.",

In order to remove the longitudinal structure induced by tides, diurnally averaged SABER temperatures are used. For MIPAS data, we use averaged temperatures between day and night. The satellite observations show that there are strong longitudinal variations in temperature in the high-latitude lower thermosphere that persist over all seasons. The peak of the diurnally averaged temperature in the lower thermosphere always occurs around the auroral zone. A clear asymmetry between the two hemispheres in the longitudinal temperature structure is observed, being more pronounced in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. In both hemispheres, the longitudinal variation is dominated by the first harmonic in longitude. The total radiative cooling observed by SABER has a structure in longitude that is similar to that of temperature. Modeling simulations using the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model reproduce similar features of the longitudinal variations of temperature in the lower thermosphere. Comparison of two model runs with and without auroral heating confirms that auroral heating causes the observed longitudinal variations. The multiyear averaged vertical structures of temperature observed by the two satellite instruments indicate that the impact of auroral heating on the thermodynamics of the neutral atmosphere can penetrate down to about 105 km.",

         "abstract": "Very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals from navigational transmitters propagate worldwide in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide formed by the Earth and the electrically conducting lower ionosphere. Changes in the signal properties are signatures of variations in the conductivity of the reflecting boundary of the lower ionosphere which is located in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and their analysis is, therefore, a way to study processes in these remote regions. Here we present a study on amplitude perturbations of local origin on the VLF transmitter signals (NPM, NLK, NAA, and JJI) observed during tropical cyclone (TC) Evan, 9-16 December 2012 when TC was in the proximity of the transmitter-receiver links. We observed a maximum amplitude perturbation of 5.7 dB on JJI transmitter during 16 December event. From Long Wave Propagation Capability model applied to three selected events we estimate a maximum decrease in the nighttime D region reference height (H') by 5.2 km (13 December, NPM) and maximum increase in the daytime D region H' by 6.1 km and 7.5 km (14 and 16 December, JJI). The results suggest that the TC caused the neutral densities of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere to lift and sink (bringing the lower ionosphere with it), an effect that may be mediated by gravity waves generated by the TC. The perturbations were observed before the storm was classified as a TC, at a time when it was a tropical depression, suggesting the broader conclusion that severe convective storms, in general, perturb the mesosphere and the stratosphere through which the perturbations propagate.",

Because of the magnetotail current sheet's dynamical nature, however, simultaneous plasma and magnetic field measurements at different radial distances are required to reveal this configuration. Simultaneous observations of the magnetotail current sheet from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) D (around 10R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail), Geotail (around 30R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail), and Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moons Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) P1 (around 55R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail) are used to study distributions of plasma (ion) density and temperature along (Earth-Sun direction) and across (north-south direction) the magnetotail. Fourteen events (each including several current sheet crossings at different downtail distances) are studied. We demonstrate that the plasma temperature along and across the magnetotail varies more significantly than plasma density does. The temperature decrease from equatorial plane to current sheet boundaries is a major contributor to the cross-tail pressure balance. The Alfven velocity V<SUB>A,B</SUB> calculated at the current sheet boundaries increases significantly toward the Earth from 700 km/s at lunar orbit \u223c55R<SUB>E</SUB> to 2200 km/s around \u223c10R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail. The corresponding energy EA=mpVA,B2 (m<SUB>p</SUB> is the proton mass) is 4 times larger than the plasma temperature T<SUB>0</SUB> in the magnetotail's equatorial plane, whereas the ratio E<SUB>A</SUB>/T<SUB>0</SUB> is constant along the magnetotail. The plasma temperature T<SUB>0</SUB> measured around lunar orbit in the magnetotail agrees well with the simultaneously measured energy of solar wind protons mpVSW2/2 (V<SUB>SW</SUB> is the solar wind speed).",

         "abstract": "The sudden formation of parallel electric fields in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling system is essential to complete substorm onset. From this standpoint, we focus substorm ignition on field-aligned acceleration by studying the dynamical behavior of auroral kilometric radiation. Field-aligned auroral acceleration shows a distinct two-step evolution at substorm onset: the activation of low-altitude acceleration (h \u223c 4000-5000 km) which corresponds to auroral initial brightening and the subsequent abrupt breakout of high-altitude acceleration (h \u223c 6000-12,000 km) which corresponds to auroral breakup. Cases when only low-altitude acceleration (first-step evolution) is activated are pseudosubstorms. This indicates that the second evolution of field-aligned acceleration divides full substorm from pseudosubstorm. The statistical relationship between the plasma flow burst in the plasma sheet and its response to the M-I coupling region shows that about 65% of flow bursts cause pseudobreakup/initial brightening (low-altitude acceleration) and one third of them develops into full substorm (low-altitude and high-altitude accelerations), while the magnitude of flow velocity does not necessarily distinguish between pseudobreakup and full substorm. This suggests that some plasma flow bursts originate field-aligned current which first enhance low-altitude acceleration, and the increasing field-aligned current induces second acceleration above the preexisting low-altitude acceleration as a consequence of current/current-driven instabilities. In this sense, the substorm is finally ignited in the auroral M-I coupling region.",

We present Cluster multispacecraft observations of Poynting fluxes associated with abrupt changes in large-scale electric fields during sudden commencements and southward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The Cluster spacecraft detected Poynting fluxes dominated by the field-aligned upward component during the preliminary impulse of sudden commencements and in the initial period after southward turning of the IMF. The upward Poynting flux indicates existence of Alfv\u00e9n waves transporting electromagnetic energy from the ionosphere toward the magnetosphere leading to magnetospheric convection changes. The waveguide model and global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation calculating evolution of the Poynting flux following solar wind pressure enhancements also show upward Poynting fluxes propagating from the ionosphere toward the magnetosphere faster than the propagation of compressional waves. We conclude that the ionosphere acts as a channel to transmit electromagnetic energy supplied as field-aligned currents toward a wide region in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system instantaneously, leading to changes in magnetospheric convection electric fields.",

         "abstract": "During the interval from 06:15 to 07:30 UT on 24 August 2005, the Chinese Tan-Ce 1 (TC1) satellite observed the multiple responses of the near-Earth magnetotail to the combined changes in solar wind dynamic pressure and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The magnetotail was highly compressed by a strong interplanetary shock because of the dynamic pressure enhancement (\u223c15 nPa), and the large shrinkage of magnetotail made a northern lobe and plasma mantle move inward to the position of the inbound TC1 that was initially in the plasma sheet. Meanwhile, the dynamic pressure fluctuations (\u223c0.5-3 nPa) behind the shock drove the quasi-periodic oscillations of the magnetopause, lobe-mantle boundary, and geomagnetic field at the same frequencies: one dominant frequency was around 3 mHz and the other was around 5 mHz. The quasi-periodic oscillations of the lobe-mantle boundary caused the alternate entries of TC1 into the northern lobe and the plasma mantle. In contrast to a single squeezed or deformed magnetotail by a solar wind discontinuity moving tailward, the compressed and oscillating magnetotail can better indicate the dynamic evolution of magnetotail when solar wind dynamic pressure increases and fluctuates remarkably, and the near-Earth magnetotail is quite sensitive even to some small changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure when it is highly compressed. Furthermore, it is found that a considerable amount of oxygen ions (O<SUP>+</SUP>) appeared in the lobe after the southward turning of IMF.",

         "abstract": "Auroral arcs are often associated with magnetically quiet time and substorm growth phases. We have studied the evolution of auroral structures during global and local magnetic activity to investigate the occurrence rate of auroral arcs during different levels of magnetic activity. The ground-magnetic and auroral conditions are described by the magnetometer and auroral camera data from five Magnetometers \u2014 Ionospheric radars \u2014 All-sky cameras Large Experiment stations in Finnish and Swedish Lapland. We identified substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases from the local electrojet index (IL) in 1996-2007 and analyzed the auroral structures during the different phases. Auroral structures were also analyzed during different global magnetic activity levels, as described by the planetary Kp index. The distribution of auroral structures for all substorm phases and Kp levels is of similar shape. About one third of all detected structures are auroral arcs. This suggests that auroral arcs occur in all conditions as the main element of the aurora. The most arc-dominated substorm phases occur in the premidnight sector, while the least arc-dominated substorm phases take place in the dawn sector. Arc event lifetimes and expectation times calculated for different substorm phases show that the longest arc-dominated periods are found during growth phases, while the longest arc waiting times occur during expansion phases. Most of the arc events end when arcs evolve to more complex structures. This is true for all substorm phases. Based on the number of images of auroral arcs and the durations of substorm phases, we conclude that a randomly selected auroral arc most likely belongs to a substorm expansion phase. A small time delay, of the order of a minute, is observed between the magnetic signature of the substorm onset (i.e., the beginning of the negative bay) and the auroral breakup (i.e., the growth phase arc changing into a dynamic display). The magnetic onset was observed to precede the structural change in the auroral display. A longer delay of a few minutes was found between the beginning of the growth phase and the first detected auroral structure.",

         "abstract": "Accurate evaluation of the physical processes during the substorm growth phase, including formation of field-aligned currents (FACs), isotropization by current sheet scattering, instabilities, and ionosphere-magnetosphere connection, relies on knowing the realistic three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic field configuration, which cannot be reliably provided by current available empirical models. We have established a 3-D substorm growth phase magnetic field model, which is uniquely constructed from empirical plasma sheet pressures under the constraint of force balance. We investigated the evolution of model pressure and magnetic field responding to increasing energy loading and their configurations under different solar wind dynamic pressure (P<SUB>SW</SUB>) and sunspot number. Our model reproduces the typical growth phase evolution signatures: plasma pressure increases, magnetic field lines become more stretched, current sheet becomes thinner, and the Region 2 FACs are enhanced. The model magnetic fields agree quantitatively well with observed fields. The magnetic field is substantially more stretched under higher P<SUB>SW</SUB>, while the dependence on sunspot number is nonlinear and less substantial. By applying our modeling to a substorm event, we found that (1) the equatorward movement of proton aurora during the growth phase is mainly due to continuous stretching of magnetic field lines, (2) the ballooning instability is more favorable during late growth phase around midnight tail where there is a localized plasma beta peak, and (3) the equatorial mapping of the breakup auroral arc is at X~-14 R<SUB>E</SUB> near midnight, coinciding with the location of the maximum growth rate for the ballooning instability.",

         "abstract": "A planet's magnetosheath extends from downstream of its bow shock up to the magnetopause, where the solar wind flow is deflected around the magnetosphere and the solar wind-embedded magnetic field lines are draped. This makes the region an important site for plasma turbulence, instabilities, reconnection, and plasma depletion layers. A relatively high Alfv\u00e9n Mach number solar wind and a polar-flattened magnetosphere make the magnetosheath of Saturn both physically and geometrically distinct from the Earth's. The polar flattening is predicted to affect the magnetosheath magnetic field structure and thus the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Here we investigate the magnetic field in the magnetosheath with the expectation that polar flattening is manifested in the overall draping pattern. We compare an accumulation of Cassini data between 2004 and 2010 with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and an analytical model representative of a draped field between axisymmetric boundaries. The draping patterns measured are well captured and in broad agreement for given upstream conditions with those of the MHD simulations (which include polar flattening). The deviations from the analytical model, based on no polar flattening, suggest that nonaxisymmetry is invariably a key feature of the magnetosphere's global structure. Our results show a comprehensive overview of the configuration of the magnetic field in a nonaxisymmetric magnetosheath as revealed by Cassini. We anticipate our assessment to provide an insight to this barely studied interface between a high Alfv\u00e9nic bow shock and a dynamic magnetosphere.",

During northward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) Bz conditions, the magnetosphere acts as a closed \"cavity\" and reacts to solar wind DPPs more simply than during southward IMF. In this study we use solar wind data collected by ACE and WIND together with magnetic field observations of Geotail, Cluster, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), Van Allen Probes, GOES missions, and ground magnetometer arrays to observe the magnetosphere (dayside, nightside, inner magnetosphere, magnetotail, magnetosheath, etc.) and ionosphere response simultaneously in several local time sectors and regions. A total of 37 events were selected during the period between February 2007 to December 2017. We examine the global response of each event and identify systematic behavior of the magnetosphere due to DPPs' compression, such as MHD wave propagation, sudden impulses, and Ultra Low Frequency waves (ULF) in the Pc5 range. Our results confirm statistical studies with a more limited coverage that have been performed at different sectors and/or regions of the magnetosphere. We present observations of the different signatures generated in different regions that propagate through the magnetosphere. The signature of the tailward traveling DPP is observed to move at the same solar wind speed, and in superposition of other known magnetospheric perturbations. It is observed that the DPP also generates or increases the amplitude of Pc4 5 waves observed in the inner magnetosphere, while similar waves are observed on the ground.",

         "abstract": "We have performed a statistical study investigating how substorm triggering and unloading is affected by the heavy ion content of the magnetotail plasma sheet. During the substorm growth phase, magnetic flux is accumulated in the tail lobes until the magnetotail reaches an unstable state. A near-Earth neutral line then forms, and this excess flux is reconnected. The increased lobe magnetic flux during the substorm growth phase increases the magnetopause flaring angle. As a result, a greater fraction of the solar-wind dynamic pressure is observed in the tail lobes and plasma sheet. Therefore, the increase and decrease of the lobe magnetic flux can be monitored by observing the increase and decrease in the magnetotail pressure. Using Cluster data from 2001 to 2004, we have determined how the maximum pressure (or flaring angle) and the rate of change of pressure (or flaring angle) during substorms depend on the O<SUP>+</SUP> content of the plasma sheet. In addition, we have estimated the maximum magnetic flux, and rate of change of the magnetic flux. Our results show that both the maximum tail pressure and the rate of change in the pressure are positively correlated with the amount of O<SUP>+</SUP> in the plasma sheet. When the measurements are normalized to account for the external solar-wind pressure and the different Cluster locations in the tail, the maximum accumulated flux and the unloading rate still correlate positively with the O<SUP>+</SUP> density and O<SUP>+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> ratio. This suggests that the additional O<SUP>+</SUP> makes it more difficult to trigger the substorm onset, but once it is triggered, the unloading is faster. This could either indicate that the presence of O<SUP>+</SUP> increases the reconnection rate, or that it initiates reconnection over a broader width of the tail.",

Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms A in the near-Earth magnetotail observed flux-enhanced electrons of 300 keV during the magnetic field dipolarization. Geosynchronous orbit satellites also observed the intensive electron injections. Located in the outer radiation belt, RBSP-A observed enhancements of MeV electrons accompanied by substorm dipolarization. The phase space density (PSD) of MeV electrons at L<SUP>*</SUP> 5.4 increased by 1 order of magnitude in 1 h, resulting in a local PSD peak of MeV electrons, which was caused by the direct effect of substorm injections. Enhanced MeV electrons in the heart of the outer radiation belt were also detected within 2 h, which may be associated with intensive substorm electron injections and subsequent local acceleration by chorus waves. Multipoint observations have shown that substorm electron injections not only can be the external source of MeV electrons at the outer edge of the outer radiation belt (L<SUP>*</SUP> 5.4) but also can provide the intensive seed populations in the outer radiation belt. These initial higher-energy electrons from injection can reach relativistic energy much faster. The observations also provide evidence that enhanced substorm electron injections can explain rapid enhancements of MeV electrons in the outer radiation belt.",

         "abstract": "The effects of the leading edge stream interface of high-speed solar-wind streams (HSSs) upon the Earth's magnetosphere have been extensively documented. The arrival of HSSs leads to significant changes in the plasmasphere, plasma sheet, ring current, and radiation belts, during the evolution from slow solar wind to persistent fast solar wind. Studies have also documented effects in the lower ionosphere and the neutral atmosphere. However, only cursory attention has been paid to the trailing-edge stream interface during the transition back from fast solar wind to slow solar wind. Here we report on the statistical changes that occur in the plasmasphere, plasma sheet, ring current, and electron radiation belt during the passage of the trailing-edge stream interface of HSSs, when the magnetosphere is in most respects in an extremely quiescent state. Counterintuitively, the peak flux of 1 MeV electrons is observed to occur at this interface. In contrast, other regions of the magnetosphere demonstrate extremely quiet conditions. As with the leading-edge stream interface, the occurrence of the trailing-edge stream interface has a periodicity of 27 days, and hence, understanding the changes that occur in the magnetosphere during the passage of trailing edges of HSSs can lead to improved forecasting and predictability of the magnetosphere as a system.",

         "abstract": "Cluster multipoint measurements are used to study two successive magnetosheath flux transfer events (FTEs). Magnetic field lines in the leading region are found to be closed magnetospheric field lines. For event 1 these field lines are wounded up by a large current structure oriented eastward and moving poleward. Conversely, the trailing region corresponds to opened magnetic field lines. For both events the leading edge of the FTEs is a tangential discontinuity separating the magnetosheath from closed field lines. In the case of event 1 magnetosheath ions are accelerated through the FTE trailing edge via a rotational discontinuity and penetrate on closed field lines through a second discontinuity. Thus, the ion jet is accelerated equatorward of the spacecraft but the backtracking of the discontinuities and the lack of dispersion show that ion acceleration occurs at less than 2 R<SUB>E</SUB> from Cluster. On the other hand the extrapolation forward indicates that the FTE bulge steepens as in simulations of Dorelli and Bhattacharjee). Evidence is given for the penetration of magnetosheath ions inside the core of the FTE, on closed field lines. Magnetosheath electrons are accelerated in parallel and antiparallel directions on open and on closed field lines, thus breaking the frozen-in condition. Event 2 is also split in two distinct regions but no evidence is found for accelerated bidirectional magnetosheath electrons. For event 2 the two discontinuities at the trailing region are stacked together when they are crossed by the spacecraft, suggesting that the current splitting is a reconnection signature.",

         "abstract": "We studied fundamental properties of spatial-temporal evolution of energetic electrons trapped in the inner magnetosphere (L \u2264 7.4) during an isolated substorm by using a four-dimensional drift kinetic simulation under the time-dependent electric and magnetic fields provided by a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. When the interplanetary magnetic field turns southward, both the potential and induction electric fields start to increase in the inner magnetosphere, resulting in a gradual injection of low-energy electrons (\u226451.9 keV) and deceleration of high-energy electrons (\u2265114 keV). The deceleration of high-energy electrons results in a decrease in the phase space density of the high-energy electrons during the growth phase. After a while, an abrupt transition of phase state (a substorm onset) occurs in the magnetosphere, which triggers abrupt changes in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The AL index decreases rapidly, and magnetic field lines become dipole-like. The dipolarization does not proceed smoothly in the inner magnetosphere because of significant force imbalance between the J \u00d7 B force and the grad P force. As a consequence, the electric field oscillates with a period of 2-3 min, resulting in multiple injections of the low-energy electrons. The low- and high-energy electrons are accelerated under the strong influence of the drift betatron and gyro betatron, so that the acceleration process is essentially nonlinear. Our simulation results suggest that the force-induced processes play an essential role in the substorm-associated redistribution of energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere.",

It is found that, during the substorm growth phase, about 39.4% (76/193) of the selected events display a phenomenon of equatorial plasma pressure (P<SUB>eq</SUB>) decrease. The occurrence rates of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease cases are higher in the dawn (04:00 to 06:00) and dusk (18:00 to 20:00) flanks (&gt; 50%) than in the midnight region (20:00 to 04:00, &lt; 40%). The mean values of the maximum percentages of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease during the substorm growth phases are larger in the dawn and dusk flanks ( -20%) than in the midnight region ( &gt; -16%). The mean value of P<SUB>eq</SUB> increase percentages at the end of substorm growth phase is the highest ( 40%) in the premidnight MLT bin (22:00 to 00:00) and is almost unchanged in the dawn and dusk flanks. Further investigations show that 13.0% of the events have more than 10% of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease at the end of substorm growth phase comparing to the value before the growth phase, and 28.0% of the events have small changes (&lt; 10%), and 59.0% events have a more than 10% increase. This study also reveals the importance of electron pressure (P<SUB>e</SUB>) in the variation of P<SUB>eq</SUB> in the substorm growth phase. The P<SUB>e</SUB> variations often account for more than 50% of the P<SUB>eq</SUB> changes, and the ratios of P<SUB>e</SUB> to ion pressure often display large variations ( 50%). Among the investigated events, during the growth phase, an enhanced equatorial plasma convection flow is observed, which diverges in the midnight tail region and propagates azimuthally toward the dayside magnetosphere with velocity of 20 km/s. It is proposed that the P<SUB>eq</SUB> decreases in the near-Earth plasma sheet during the substorm growth phase may be due to the transport of closed magnetic flux toward the dayside magnetosphere driven by dayside magnetopause reconnection. Both solar wind and ionospheric conductivity effects may influence the distributions of occurrence rates for P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease events and the P<SUB>eq</SUB> increase percentages in the investigated region.",

The ENA energy used in the present study ranges from 10 to 198 keV for hydrogen and from 29 to 222 keV for oxygen. We use ENA data obtained from two independent areas of a HENA image, for which HENA lines of sight pass through the inner magnetosphere (\u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; X &lt; \u223c-3 R<SUB>E</SUB> around the magnetic equator) and the outer magnetosphere (X &lt; \u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB> around the magnetic equator). The analyses of the selected ENA data yield the following results: (1) The oxygen ENA flux displays 20-30 min bursts during all substorms, while the hydrogen ENA flux did not increase or less significantly increased than the oxygen flux. (2) The temporal evolution of energy spectra is mass dependent for all examined substorms. (3) For two of the substorms, the oxygen flux ratio between before and after a substorm increases with increasing energy, indicating the hardening of an O<SUP>+</SUP> energy spectrum. (4) The flux ratio for the inner image area is comparable to or higher than that in the outer area. The results confirm that nonadiabatic acceleration with regard to the first adiabatic invariant did occur in the near-Earth magnetotail (X &gt; -8 R<SUB>E</SUB>). Although the influence of the nonadiabatic acceleration appears in the inner magnetosphere (\u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; X &lt; \u223c-3 R<SUB>E</SUB>) as well as the outer magnetosphere (\u223c-8 R<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; X &lt; \u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB>), it is not clear from the present results whether O<SUP>+</SUP> energization in the inner magnetosphere is due to nonadiabatic acceleration in the inner magnetosphere or adiabatic transport of O<SUP>+</SUP> nonadiabatically accelerated in the outer magnetosphere. It is likely, for at least the two substorms, that the nonadiabatic acceleration makes a more significant contribution to O<SUP>+</SUP> energization than increase of the O<SUP>+</SUP> density in the plasma sheet.",

         "abstract": "Periodic oscillations associated with Alfven waves with periods ranging from several tens of minutes to several hours are commonly seen in the solar wind. It is not yet known how the solar wind oscillation frequency, and thus its temporal variation, regulates the energy flow through the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. Utilizing the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model driven by solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), we have analyzed the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system response to IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillations with periods of 10, 30, and 60 min from the perspective of energy budget. Our results indicate that the energy flow from the solar wind to geospace depends on the IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillation frequency. The energy coupling efficiency, defined as the ratio of the globally integrated joule heating to Akasofu's Epsilon function, is higher for lower frequency IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillations. Joule heating in the upper atmosphere depends not only on directly driven processes due to solar wind variability but also on the intrinsic dynamics of the magnetosphere (i.e., loading-unloading process). This work highlights the critical role of solar wind and IMF temporal variation and the inductive inertia and resistance of coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system in controlling the energy transfer in the coupled solar wind-geospace system, which has not been explored before.",

Saturn's magnetosphere is stabilized by a radially increasing profile of flux tube entropy and destabilized by a radially decreasing profile of flux tube content. The traditional radial transport scenario suggested that the magnetic flux with heavy flux tube content moves from the inner magnetosphere to the outer magnetosphere, stretching the magnetic field into a magnetodisc configuration. Subsequently, magnetic flux with low flux tube entropy generated by magnetodisc reconnection circulates back to the inner magnetosphere. However, the low-specific entropy plasma with a narrow distribution in Saturn's inner magnetosphere suggests a significant nonadiabatic cooling process during the inward motion. The flux tube entropy analysis suggests that energetic particles dominate the total flux tube entropy in the magnetodisc region, and newly closed field lines generated by magnetodisc reconnection are likely to be transported into the inner magnetosphere. Based on the flux tube entropy constraint, this study demonstrates that the radial transport process in Saturn's magnetosphere can also be achieved via middle-latitude double reconnection, driven by a low-latitude interchange instability. This process does not involve significant latitudinal convection of magnetic flux in the ionosphere nor does it significantly modify the radial flux tube entropy profile.",

From the cross-examination of the estimates of various ionospheric and magnetospheric processes, it is inferred that (1) Poynting flux from the tail lobes to the plasma sheet accounts for the ionospheric energy dissipation during the substorm expansion phase, suggesting that the lobe reconnection is the primary driver of the substorm energy transport to the ionosphere; (2) the area around the duskside poleward boundary of the auroral bulge, where auroral emission is intense throughout the expansion phase, accounts for &gt;10%, likely a few tens of percent, of the ionospheric substorm energy dissipation, suggesting that the area is a crucial energy sink; and (3) kinetic energy carried by the bursty bulk flows is comparable to the energy deposited in association with the auroral streamers, and each bursty bulk flow accounts for 1% of the total substorm energy deposition, which may sum up to 10% throughout the expansion phase. Points 2 and 3 imply that energy deposited to the ionosphere is transported mostly along, rather than across, the magnetic field lines in the plasma sheet. The responsible field-aligned plasma flows may be generated as the perpendicular plasma motion creates field-aligned pressure gradient in the presence of field line curvature. Energy flux associated with enhanced convection in the plasma sheet is statistically examined with the Geotail data set, which confirms that more energy is carried earthward by the field-aligned flows than by the convection flows.",

The Fourier fitting method was applied to obtain the monthly mean amplitudes of zonal wind, TEC and EEJ. The least squares fitting method was utilized to perform a spectral analysis. Our data indicate that the QBOs of the stratosphere and mesosphere are present in the zonal winds between 20 and 40 km and 82 and 96 km at KB. The QBO is also present in the global TEC at 40\u00b0S to 40\u00b0N latitude and is characterized by the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). We propose that the QBOs in the mesosphere are linked to the QBOs in the ionosphere through the modulation of the E region dynamo by neutral winds and the equatorial ionospheric fountain effect. This model is verified by the QBO signals in the EEJ and diurnal tides in the E region of the ionosphere. The absence of QBO signals in the zonal wind at 250 km confirms that QBO signals in the TEC are not modulated by the zonal wind in the F region ionosphere, which further substantiates the model.",

During its period of greatest intensity, in the central Caribbean, Matthew excited a large number of concentric gravity waves (GWs or CGWs). In this paper, we report on hurricane-generated CGWs observed in both the stratosphere and mesosphere from spaceborne satellites and in the ionosphere by ground Global Positioning System receivers. We found CGWs with horizontal wavelengths of 200-300 km in the stratosphere (height of 30-40 km) and in the airglow layer of the mesopause (height of 85-90 km), and we found concentric traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs or CTIDs) with horizontal wavelengths of 250-350 km in the ionosphere (height of 100-400 km). The observed TIDs lasted for more than several hours on 1, 2, and 7 October 2016. We also briefly discuss the vertical and horizontal propagation of the Hurricane Matthew-induced GWs and TIDs. This study shows that Hurricane Matthew induced significant dynamical coupling between the troposphere and the entire middle and upper atmosphere via GWs. It is the first comprehensive satellite analysis of gravity wave propagation generated by hurricane event from the troposphere through the stratosphere and mesosphere into the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "The four Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observed energetic (E&gt;50 keV) ion bursts exhibiting an inverse dispersion in the magnetosheath on 28 December 2015. We consider the possibility that these ions originate from the magnetosphere. The ion composition ratios, flux levels, and the spectral slopes of the energetic ion energy spectra observed in the foreshock and in the magnetosheath resemble those in the outer magnetosphere but differ significantly from those seen further upstream from the bow shock at ACE. The particle gyrocenters lie earthward from the spacecraft, indicating that the maximum ion fluxes come from close to the magnetosphere. We provide important evidence that argues against an explanation of the particle source in terms of hot flow anomaly acceleration. A three-dimensional global hybrid simulation shows that escaping magnetospheric ions can be scattered and transported across the magnetosheath. Ground magnetometer observations suggest that a solar wind pressure increase accelerates escaping magnetospheric ions via betatron acceleration, resulting in an inverse energy dispersion in the magnetosheath. However, there are no pressure changes detected on the MMS and ACE spacecraft and the ground magnetic field strength does not appear to be large enough to be consistent with the large magnetospheric compression needed to account for a betatron acceleration. Therefore, we suggest that the inverse energy dispersion event can be explained by a magnetic field rotation that connects MMS to the subsolar magnetosphere, enabling high-energy particles from deep within the inner magnetosphere gain access to the magnetopause and magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "GPS-based ionospheric tomography is a well-known technique for imaging the total electron content (TEC) between GPS satellites and receivers. However, as an integral measurement of electron concentration, TEC typically encompasses both the ionosphere and plasmasphere, masking signatures from the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere due to the dominant ionosphere. Imaging these regions requires a technique that isolates TEC in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere. Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System (MIDAS) employs tomography to image the electron distribution in the ionosphere. Its implementation for regions beyond is yet to be seen due to the different dynamics present above the ionosphere. This paper discusses the extension of MIDAS to image these altitudes using GPS phase-based TEC measurements and follows the work by Spencer and Mitchell (2011). Plasma is constrained to dipole field lines described by Euler potentials, resulting in a distribution symmetrical about the geomagnetic equator. A simulation of an empirical plasmaspheric model by Gallagher et al. (1988) is used to verify the technique by comparing reconstructions of the simulation with the empirical model. The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) is used as GPS receiver locations. The verification is followed by a validation of the modified MIDAS algorithm, where the regions' TEC is reconstructed from COSMIC GPS phase measurements and qualitatively compared with previous studies using Jason-1 and COSMIC data. Results show that MIDAS can successfully image features/trends of the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere observed in other studies, with deviations in absolute TEC attributed to differences in data set properties and the resolution of the images.",

Night time MSTIDs are caused generally by the polarization electric field in the ionosphere. However, propagation of this polarization electric field to the magnetosphere has not yet been identified. Here, we report the first observation of the polarization electric field and associated density variations of a night time MSTID in the magnetosphere. The MSTID event was observed by an all-sky airglow imager at Gakona (geographical latitude: 62.39\u00b0N, geographical longitude: 214.78\u00b0E, magnetic latitude: 63.20\u00b0N), Alaska. The Arase satellite passed over the MSTID in the inner magnetosphere at 0530-0800 UT (2030-2300 LT) on November 3, 2018. This MSTID, observed in 630 nm airglow images, was propagating westward with a horizontal wavelength of \u223c165 km, a north-south phase front, and a phase velocity of \u223c80 m/s. The Arase satellite footprint on the ionosphere crossed the MSTID in the direction nearly perpendicular to the MSTID phase fronts. The electric field and electron density observed by the Arase satellite showed periodic variation associated with the MSTID structure with amplitudes of \u223c2 mV/m and \u223c150 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively. The electric field variations projected to the ionosphere are mainly in the east-west direction and are consistent with the direction of the polarization electric field expected from MSTID growth by E \u00d7 B drift. This observation indicates that the polarization electric field associated with the MSTID in the ionosphere is projected onto the magnetosphere, causing plasma density fluctuations in the magnetosphere.",

The goal of this study is to understand physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of active discrete auroral forms (curls and folds) typically observed during the substorm onset. Our simulations demonstrate that active feedback of the auroral ionosphere on magnetic field-aligned currents carried by ULF Alfv\u00e9n waves can explain wide variety of auroral structures. The main reason for this variety is a susceptibility of the electrodynamics of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system to parameters of the electric field and plasma in the ionosphere and magnetosphere of the Earth. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, different combinations of these parameters lead to different spatial and temporal behavior of the magnetic field-aligned currents producing aurora. One of the main conclusions from our study is that the ionosphere is responsible for the formation of small-scale curls and folds in the discrete aurora and for the intensification of magnetic field-aligned currents, observed during substorms. The results from our 3-D simulations are applied for the explanation of structure of discrete auroral arcs observed during the 29 October 2013 substorm at Fort Yukon, Alaska.",

         "abstract": "From multipoint, in situ observations and imaging, we reveal the injection-powered, Alfv\u00e9nic nature of auroral acceleration during onset and expansion of a substorm. It is shown how Alfv\u00e9nic variations over time dissipate to form large-scale, inverted-V structures characteristic of quasistatic aurora. This characterization is made possible through the fortuitous occurrence of a substorm onset and expansion phase on field lines traversed by Cluster in the high-altitude acceleration region. Substorm onset was preceded by the occurrence of multiple poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) and subsequent development/progression of a streamer toward the growth phase arc indicating that this is of the PBI-/streamer-triggered class of substorms. Onset on Cluster is marked by the injection of hot, dense magnetospheric plasma in a region tied to one of the preexisting PBI current systems. This was accompanied by a surge of Alfv\u00e9nic activity and enhanced inverted-V acceleration, as the PBI current system intensified and striated to dispersive scale Alfv\u00e9n waves. The growth of Alfv\u00e9n wave activity was significant (up to a factor of 300 increase in magnetic field power spectral density at frequencies 20 mHz \u2272f\u2272 few hertz) and coincided with moderate growth (factor 3-5) in the background PBI current. This sequence is indicative of a cascade process whereby small-scale/dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves are generated from large-scale Alfv\u00e9n waves or current destabilization. It also demonstrates that the initial PBIs and their subsequent evolution are an intrinsic part of the global auroral substorm response to injection and accompanying wave energy input from the magnetotail. Alfv\u00e9nic activity persisted poleward of the PBI currents composing a broad Alfv\u00e9n wave-dominated region extending to the polar cap edge. These waves have transverse scales ranging from a few tens of kilometers to below the ion gyroradius and are associated with large electric fields (up to 200 mV/m) and Poynting fluxes (up to 200 mW/m<SUP>2</SUP> mapped at ionospheric altitudes). The fluctuations show mixtures of traveling and/or reflected (including standing) wave signatures, depending on frequency and location. A transition from incoming traveling wave to standing wave signatures is also seen near onset. Depending on location, electron distributions show signatures of Alfv\u00e9n acceleration, inverted-V acceleration, or evidence of both. Poleward expansion of substorm emissions coincided with the poleward expansion of the hot energetic plasma, and the formation of a large-scale inverted-V current system with concurrent attenuation of Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations within the Alfv\u00e9n-dominated region. We suggest that the attenuation is due to a dissipative effect owing to changes in the dispersive properties of these waves via the injection process and/or due to a transient magnetotail source. These findings suggest that in addition to playing active roles in driving substorm aurora, inverted-V and Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration processes are causally linked.",

         "abstract": "Examining the response to solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation is an established diagnostic method used to understand the physics of planetary environments. In this study, we focus on the response of the Jovian thermosphere to variations in the solar EUV flux and discuss the consequences for the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system. We use a model that simulates both the thermospheric dynamics and the magnetospheric plasma velocity distribution under conditions of angular momentum transport between these regions. The simulations show that when the EUV flux increases by ~100% and 200%, the thermospheric neutral wind velocity at ~45\u00b0 latitude increases by 16% and 22%, respectively. The short-term variation over a few Earth days causes an increased velocity at middle latitudes which are magnetically conjugate to the Jovian radiation belt. Increased heating due to solar EUV contributes to this velocity change. The other contribution arises ~30 planetary rotations after the initial solar EUV flux increase. This second (\"delayed\") effect is due to propagation of momentum from high latitudes (the auroral region), where Joule heating is dominant, and is related to the behavior of the ionospheric conductance and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents. The modeled velocity enhancement is smaller than that required to explain the observed enhancement of the synchrotron emission by radial diffusion of the trapped energetic electrons. In this context, we discuss the sensitivity of the underlying thermosphere-ionosphere response to short-wavelength solar radiation and the ensuing three-dimensional wind fields.",

         "abstract": "This study investigates the role of solar EUV intensity at controlling the location of the Mars magnetotail current sheet and the structure of the lobes. Four simulation results are examined from a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model. The solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions are held constant, and the Mars crustal field sources are omitted from the simulation configuration. This isolates the influence of solar EUV. It is found that solar maximum conditions, regardless of season, result in a Venus-like tail configuration with the current sheet shifted to the -Y (dawnside) direction. Solar minimum conditions result in a flipped tail configuration with the current sheet shifted to the +Y (duskside) direction. The lobes follow this pattern, with the current sheet shifting away from the larger lobe with the higher magnetic field magnitude. The physical process responsible for this solar EUV control of the magnetotail is the magnetization of the dayside ionosphere. During solar maximum, the ionosphere is relatively strong and the draped IMF field lines quickly slip past Mars. At solar minimum, the weaker ionosphere allows the draped IMF to move closer to the planet. These lower altitudes of the closest approach of the field line to Mars greatly hinder the day-to-night flow of magnetic flux. This results in a buildup of magnetic flux in the dawnside lobe as the S-shaped topology on that side of the magnetosheath extends farther downtail. The study demonstrates that the Mars dayside ionosphere exerts significant control over the nightside induced magnetosphere of that planet.&lt;abstract type=\"synopsis\"&gt;&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Plain Language SummaryMars, which does not have a strong magnetic field, has an induced magnetic environment from the draping of the interplanetary magnetic field from the Sun. It folds around Mars, forming two \"lobes\" of magnetic field behind the planet with a current sheet of electrified gas (plasma) behind it. The current sheet is not directly behind the planet but rather shifted toward the dawn or dusk direction. It is shown here that one factor controlling the location of the current sheet is the dayside ionosphere. At solar maximum, the ionosphere is dense, the magnetic field slips easily by the planet, and the current sheet is shifted toward dawn. At solar minimum, the ionosphere is relatively weak, the magnetic field slippage is slowed down, and the current sheet shifts toward dusk.",

All passes were divided into three angular sectors near 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 \u03b8<SUB>E</SUB> angles in order to estimate the role of the interplanetary magnetic field direction in plasma and magnetic properties of dayside Martian magnetosphere. The time interval chosen was from 17 January to 4 February 2016 when MAVEN was crossing the dayside magnetosphere at solar zenith angle 70\u00b0. Magnetosphere as the region with prevailing energetic planetary ions is always found between the magnetosheath and the ionosphere. The analysis of dayside interaction region showed that for each angular sector with different orientation of the solar wind electric field vector E = -1/c V \u00d7 B one can find specific profiles of the magnetosheath, the magnetic barrier (Michel, 1971, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/RG009i002p00427\">https://doi.org/10.1029/RG009i002p00427</A>; Zhang et al., 1991, https://doi.org/10.1029/91JA00088), and the magnetosphere. Magnetic barrier forms in front of the magnetosphere, and relative magnetic field magnitudes in these two domains vary. The average height of the boundary with ionosphere is 530 km, and the average height of the magnetopause is 730 km. We discuss the implications of the observed magnetosphere structure to the planetary ions loss mechanism.",

         "abstract": "We have taken a key step in evaluating the importance of ionospheric outflows relative to electrodynamic coupling in the thermosphere's impact on geospace dynamics. We isolated the thermosphere's material influence and suppressed electrodynamic feedback in whole geospace simulations by imposing a time constant ionospheric conductance in the ionospheric Ohm's law in a coupled model that combines the multifluid Lyon Fedder Mobarry magnetosphere model with the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model and the Ionosphere Polar Wind Model that includes both polar wind and transversely accelerated ion species. Numerical experiments were conducted for different thermospheric states parameterized by F10.7 for interplanetary driving representative of the stream interaction region that swept past Earth on March 27, 2003. We demonstrate that thermosphere through its regulation of ionospheric outflows influences magnetosphere ionosphere (MI) convection and the ion composition, symmetries, x line perimeter and magnetic merging of the magnetosphere. Feedback to the ionosphere thermosphere from evolving MI convection, and Alfv\u00e9nic Poynting fluxes and soft (\u223cfew 100 eV) electron precipitation originating in the magnetosphere, in turn, modify the evolving O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow properties. The simulation results identify a variety of observed magnetospheric features that are attributable directly to the thermosphere's material influence: Asymmetries in O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow fluxes and velocities in the pre/postnoon low altitude magnetosphere, dawn/duskside lobes and pre/postmidnight plasmasheet; O<SUP>+</SUP> distribution of the plasmasheet; magnetic x line location and reconnection rate along it. O<SUP>+</SUP> outflows during solar maximum conditions (high F10.7) tend to counteract the plasmasheet's pre/postmidnight asymmetries caused by the night to day gradient in ionospheric Hall conductance.",

         "abstract": "At the beginning of 2007 the twin STEREO spacecraft provided a unique opportunity to study the global solar wind control of the terrestrial magnetotail under typical solar activity minimum conditions. The STEREO-B (STB) spacecraft flew in the vicinity of the far terrestrial magnetotail, while the STEREO-A (STA) spacecraft was located in front of the Earth performing measurements in the undisturbed solar wind. In February, the STB spacecraft was located in the magnetosheath most of the time but experienced several incursions into the distant magnetotail. Comparison of STA and STB observations determines unambiguously whether solar wind events such as energetic particle enhancements observed by STB are of pure solar origin or due to the influence of the terrestrial magnetosphere. During this time period in 2007, there were solar minimum conditions with alternating fast and slow solar wind streams that formed corotating interaction regions, which were the dominating source of magnetospheric disturbances encountering the Earth almost every week. Under these conditions, STB experienced multiple bow shock and magnetopause crossings due to the induced highly dynamic behavior of the terrestrial magnetotail and detected bursts of tailward directed energetic ions in the range of 110-2200 keV accompanied by suprathermal electrons of ~700-1500 eV, which were not seen in the undisturbed solar wind by STA. The corotating interaction regions triggered these energetic particle enhancements, and we demonstrate their magnetosphere-related origin. Even after leaving the magnetosheath in March 2007, STB continued to observe antisunward directed energetic ion bursts until May up to a distance of ~ 800 R<SUB>E</SUB> behind Earth, the largest distance to which solar wind and magnetospheric interaction has been observed. These results show that Earth is a very significant source of energetic particles in its local interplanetary environment.",

This emission is the result of an electrical current system, which couples the magnetosphere to the planetary atmosphere in an attempt to enforce the corotation of the middle magnetospheric plasma. Field-aligned currents transfer angular momentum from the atmosphere to the magnetosphere. In the equatorial plane, the field-aligned currents diverge into radially outward currents, which exert a torque on the plasma due to the J \u00d7 B forces. Equatorward ionospheric currents exert an opposite torque on the ionosphere, which interacts with the thermosphere via ion-neutral collisions. The upward field-aligned currents result in auroral electron precipitation, depositing energy into the high-latitude atmosphere. This energy input is a possible candidate for explaining the large thermospheric temperature measured by the Galileo probe at equatorial latitudes; however, previous atmospheric circulation models have shown that the bulk of the energy is transported poleward, rather than equatorward. We present numerical results of Jupiter's coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system including, for the first time, field-aligned potentials. The model is compared with three previously published works. We find that the rotational decoupling of the magnetospheric and thermospheric angular velocities in the presence of field-aligned potentials tempers the thermospheric response to the outward transport of magnetospheric plasma, but this is a secondary effect to variations in the Pedersen conductance.",

In the present study, we expand upon the Alfv\u00e9n wing model of CPCP saturation by investigating its impact on the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system, particularly the Region 1 FAC input into the polar cap. Our hypothesis is that the ability of open flux tubes to deform in response to applied fluid stress from the magnetosheath is governed by the magnetosheath plasma beta, which in turn governs the Maxwell stress imposed on ionospheric plasma from the magnetosphere. We performed 32 MHD simulations with varying solar wind density and interplanetary magnetic field strength and show that the plasma beta does govern the deformation of open field lines, as well as the nonlinear response of the Region 1 FAC system to increasingly southward interplanetary magnetic field. Further, we show that the current-voltage relationship in the ionosphere also shows a dependence on the plasma beta in the magnetosheath, with the ionosphere becoming more resistive at lower beta.",

Simulations with the Space Weather Modeling Framework are used to investigate the global dynamics and energization of ions throughout the magnetosphere during storm time, with a focus on the formation and evolution of the ring current. Simulations involving multifluid (with variable H<SUP>+</SUP>/O<SUP>+</SUP> ratio in the inner magnetosphere) and single-fluid (with constant H<SUP>+</SUP>/O<SUP>+</SUP> ratio in the inner magnetosphere) MHD for the global magnetosphere with inner boundary conditions set either by specifying a constant ion density or by physics-based calculations of the ion fluxes reveal that dynamical changes of the ion composition in the inner magnetosphere alter the total energy density of the magnetosphere, leading to variations in the magnetic field as well as particle drifts throughout the simulated domain. A low oxygen to hydrogen ratio and outflow resulting from a constant ion density boundary produced the most disturbed magnetosphere, leading to a stronger ring current but misses the timing of the storm development. Conversely, including a physics-based solution for the ionospheric outflow to the magnetosphere system leads to a reduction in the cross-polar cap potential (CPCP). The increased presence of oxygen in the inner magnetosphere affects the global magnetospheric structure and dynamics and brings the nightside reconnection point closer to the Earth. The combination of reduced CPCP together with the formation of the reconnection line closer to the Earth yields less adiabatic heating in the magnetotail and reduces the amount of energetic plasma that has access to the inner magnetosphere.",

To investigate signal propagation paths and signal travel times, we use a magnetohydrodynamic global simulation model of the Earth magnetosphere and ionosphere, OpenGGCM-CTIM model. By creating single impulse or sinusoidal pulsations in various locations in the magnetotail, the waves are launched, and we investigate the paths taken by the waves and the time that different waves take to reach the ionosphere. We find that it takes approximately about 27, 36, 45, 60, and 72 s for waves to travel from the tail plasma sheet at x =- 10,-15,-20,-25, and -30R<SUB>E</SUB>, respectively, to the ionosphere, contrary to previous reports. We also find that waves originating in the plasma sheet generally travel faster through the lobes than through the plasma sheet.",

Runs are performed for solar wind TDs possessing different polarization senses of magnetic field (north-to-south or south-to-north from the leading to trailing side of the incident TD) and initial half-widths. Two-step compression processes are shown in the transmitted TD, including a \u201cshock compression,\u201d as the TD passes through the shock followed by a subsequent \u201cconvective compression\u201d while the TD is moving in the magnetosheath toward the magnetopause. In cases with a relatively thin solar wind TD, 3-D patchy reconnection is initiated in the transmitted TD, forming magnetosheath flux ropes. Differences between these flux ropes and those due to magnetopause reconnection are discussed. Multiple components of ion particles are present in the velocity distribution in the magnetosheath merging, accompanied by ion heating. For cases with a relatively wide initial TD, a dominant single X line appears in the subsolar magnetosheath after the transmitted TD is narrowed through the two-step compression process. Specifically, in the cases with a south-to-north field rotation across an incident thin TD, the magnetosheath flux ropes could re-reconnect with the closed geomagnetic field lines to generate a closed field line region with mixed magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas, which may contribute to the transport of solar wind plasma into the magnetospheric boundary layer.",

We find a close spatiotemporal relationship of the SCW with many other essential signatures of substorm activity in the magnetotail and demonstrate its azimuthally localized structure and stepwise expansion in the magnetotail. We confirm that ground SCW diagnostics makes it possible to reconstruct and organize the azimuthal spatiotemporal substorm development pattern with accuracy better than 1 h magnetic local time (MLT) in the case of medium-scale substorm. The Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE)-based study of global field-aligned current distribution indicates that (a) the SCW-related field-aligned current system consists of simultaneously activated R1- and R2-type currents, (b) their net currents have a R1-sense, and (c) locations of net current peaks are consistent with the SCW edge locations inferred from midlatitude variations. Thanks to good azimuthal coverage of four GOES and three Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms spacecraft, we evaluated the intensities of the SCW R1- and R2-like current loops (using the SCW2L model) obtained from combined magnetospheric and ground midlatitude magnetic observations and found the net currents consistent (within a factor of 2) with the AMPERE-based estimate. We also ran an adaptive magnetospheric model and show that SCW2L model outperforms it in predicting the magnetic configuration changes during substorm dipolarizations.",

         "abstract": "Although the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral ionosphere contains interesting dynamic phenomena that may significantly impact the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system, it has been much less studied than the dusk-to-premidnight sector. We discuss a dynamic phenomenon in the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral oval, eastward fast flows mainly within the expanse of the Region 1 current (its part equatorward of the polar cap). These flows peak and have a steep speed gradient (increase from low to high latitude) near the interface between the Region 1 and Region 2 currents. Because such flows correspond to an electric field that most likely comes from enhanced Region 2 currents and an associated spatial conductivity gradient, their generation mechanism is analogous to that of a subauroral polarization stream. Therefore, we refer to such an eastward flow as a dawnside auroral polarization stream (DAPS). We show several examples of the presence and absence of DAPS under different geomagnetic activity levels. A DAPS' electric field can heat the ionosphere (and thus the thermosphere), change the convection pattern of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and modify the drift path of magnetospheric particles. Because a DAPS' flow peak maps to a major site of magnetic-kinetic energy conversion in the magnetosphere (the transition region between dipole and stretched field), it may be important for the conversion. A DAPS' steep flow gradient is also potentially important; it may lead to instabilities, such as that responsible for auroral Omega bands. Given its potential importance, knowledge of DAPS is fundamental for understanding the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system.",

Cusp and mantle currents arise, and the symmetry of the FAC across the noon-night meridional plane breaks in the ionosphere. In addition to the self-closed currents in the Northern or Southern hemispheres, three more types of current streamlines connecting the two ionospheres are shown from the simulation results. The first current, including the cusp current, originates from the southern ionosphere and flows into the northern ionosphere. The second current, mainly the mantle current, and the tail current are connected to form a single current system, threading most of the magnetosphere along a spiral-like path and closing through the two lobes in the far magnetotail. The third current flowing out of the southern and into the northern ionosphere connects the two ionospheres by finally closing through the bow shock instead of the magnetopause. Quantitative results are presented and discussed for the four types of current streamlines and indicate that for the dominant IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> conditions the bow shock current should be included among the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.",

         "abstract": "The ionospheric plasma in midlatitude moves upward/downward during the geomagnetic sudden commencement causing the HF Doppler frequency changes; SCF (+ -) and (- +) on the dayside and nightside, respectively, except for the SCF (+ -) in the evening as found by Kikuchi et al. (1985). Although the preliminary and main frequency deviations (PFD, MFD) of the SCF have been attributed to the dusk-to-dawn and dawn-to-dusk potential electric fields, there still remain questions if the positive PFD can be caused by the compressional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave and what causes the evening anomaly of the SCF. With the HF Doppler sounder, we show that the dayside ionosphere moves upward toward the Sun during the main impulse (MI) of the SC, when the compressional wave is supposed to push the ionosphere downward. The motion of the ionosphere is shown to be correlated with the equatorial electrojet, matching the potential electric field transmitted with the ionospheric currents from the polar ionosphere. We confirmed that the electric field of the compressional wave is severely suppressed by the conducting ionosphere and reproduced the SC electric fields using the global MHD simulation in which the potential solver is employed. The model calculations well reproduced the preliminary impulse and MI electric fields and their evening anomaly. It is suggested that the electric potential is transmitted from the polar ionosphere to the equator by the zeroth-order transverse magnetic (TM0) mode waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. The near-instantaneous transmission of the electric potential leads to instantaneous global response of the incompressible ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "For 15 high-speed-stream-driven geomagnetic activations (weak storms) in 2006-2007, the temporal behaviors of the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit and the energetic-electron population of the magnetotail are compared via superposed-epoch averaging of data. The magnetotail measurements are obtained by using GPS-orbit measurements that magnetically map out into the magnetotail. Four temporal phases of high-speed-stream-driven storms are studied: (1) the pre-storm density decay of the electron-radiation belt, (2) the electron-radiation-belt density dropout near the time of storm onset, (3) the rapid density recovery a few hours after dropout, and (4) the heating of the electron radiation belt during the high-speed-stream-driven geomagnetic activity. In all four phases the behaviors of the outer electron radiation belt and of the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail are the same and simultaneous. The physical explanations for the behavior in phase 1 (decay), phase 2 (dropout), and phase 4 (heating) lie in the dipolar regions of the magnetosphere: hence for those three phases it is concluded that the temporal behavior of the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail mimics the behavior of the outer electron radiation belt. Behavior attributable to physical processes in the dipole is seen in the magnetotail energetic-electron population: this implies that the origin of the energetic-electron population of the magnetotail is \u201cleakage\u201d or \u201coutward evaporation\u201d from the outer electron radiation belt in the dipolar magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Waves in the atmosphere, ionosphere, magnetosphere, and oceans are important mechanisms for dissipating and distributing energy throughout the Earth-atmosphere system. Internal waves are extremely important in the atmosphere, and past global studies have looked at the impacts of gravity waves on the thermosphere using gravity wave parameterizations. Here, in contrast, a medium-scale gravity wave is studied in a global thermosphere-ionosphere model, to determine the 3-D characteristics of the wave as it propagated upward through the thermosphere. The model used is a time-dependent, high-resolution, numerical model of the global thermosphere-ionosphere system, which produces global distributions of mass density, temperature, and all three components of the neutral wind at altitudes from 90 to 500 km. The gravity wave horizontal wavelengths that are measured in the thermosphere are hundreds to thousands of kilometers, with periods associated with these waves of about an hour. Therefore, a gravity wave that is physical, present in the thermosphere, and resolvable in the global numerical model was generated for this study; this wave is a 1000 km horizontal wavelength wave with a 3 h period. The gravity wave grows in amplitude, reaches a critical state and then breaks, creating curved wavefronts, and depositing its energy locally. As the gravity wave breaks, depositing its energy, a secondary wave is generated from the original gravity wave, with horizontal wavelengths of 4000 to 5000 km. The secondary wave propagates globally, unlike the original gravity wave, which only propagates in a local area. The original gravity wave had amplitudes for density and temperature of 35% and \u00b1100 K, respectively, while the secondary wave had amplitudes of 5% and \u00b120 K, respectively.",

         "abstract": "This paper discusses the major pathways of electron distribution function formation in the region of diffuse aurora. The diffuse aurora accounts for about of 75% of the auroral energy precipitating into the upper atmosphere, and its origin has been the subject of much discussion. We show that an earthward stream of precipitating electrons initially injected from the Earth<SUP>'</SUP>s plasma sheet via wave-particle interactions degrades in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produces secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These electrons of magnetospheric origin are then reflected back into the magnetosphere along closed dipolar magnetic field lines, leading to a series of reflections and consequent magnetospheric interactions that greatly augment the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km). To date this, systematic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling element has not been included in auroral research models, and, as we demonstrate in this article, has a dramatic effect (200-300%) on the formation of the precipitating fluxes that result in the diffuse aurora. It is shown that wave-particle interaction processes that drive precipitating fluxes in the region of diffuse aurora from the magnetospheric altitudes are only the first step in the formation of electron precipitation at ionospheric altitudes, and they cannot be separated from the atmospheric \"collisional machine\" that redistributes and transfers their energy inside the magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling system.",

(2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024223\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024223</A>) suggested that time domain structures (TDSs) drive pulsating aurora (with additional contributions by kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves (KAWs)) and that chorus waves have negligible effects. In this comment, we point out that electrons scattered by TDS or KAW (dominantly at 0.1-3 keV, &lt;1 s modulation) cannot explain key features of pulsating aurora, which require precipitation above a few keV with a couple of tens of second modulation. Their study did not conduct quantitative evaluations of wave-aurora correlation. The use of short burst mode data ( &lt;10 s) may only cover a single pulse of pulsating aurora and is not suitable for examining connections to pulsating aurora. \"Field-aligned\" electrons do not necessarily represent loss cone population, and their characteristic energy (hundreds of eV) is much lower than typical precipitation over pulsating aurora. By reexamining the events studied by Mozer et al., we quantitatively demonstrate that TDS and KAW are uncorrelated with pulsating aurora and that only chorus waves showed high correlations with pulsating aurora. Occasional simultaneous occurrence of TDS/KAW and pulsating aurora is found to be coincidental, because the correlation over a time scale of minutes is poor. Several auroral features analyzed in that paper are not pulsating aurora but other types of aurora. We also show that the chorus-pulsating aurora correlation can last for 2 h or longer and can be used to highlight dynamic changes in magnetic field mapping. Chorus waves can resonate with electrons above a few keV and are in agreement with pulsating auroral properties.",

The ensemble is generated by perturbing either the high-latitude electric potential or auroral energy flux in the assimilative mapping for ionosphere electrodynamics (AMIE). Simulations with perturbed high-latitude electric potential result in substantial intraensemble variability in the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to the geomagnetic storm, and the ensemble standard deviation for the change in N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> reaches 50-100% of the mean change. Such large intraensemble variability is not seen when perturbing the auroral energy flux. In this case, the effects of the forcing uncertainty are primarily confined to high latitudes. We therefore conclude that the specification of high-latitude electric fields is an important source of uncertainty when modeling the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to a geomagnetic storm. A multiple linear regression analysis of the results indicates that uncertainty in the storm time changes in the equatorial electric fields, neutral winds, and neutral composition can all contribute to the uncertainty in the ionosphere electron density. The results of the present study provide insight into the possible uncertainty in simulations of the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to geomagnetic storms due to imperfect knowledge of the high-latitude forcing.",

         "abstract": "Observations of Saturn's ultraviolet and infrared aurora show structures that, when traced along the planetary magnetic field, map to the inner, middle, and outer magnetosphere. From low to high latitudes the structures seen in the UV are the Enceladus footprint, which maps to an equatorial radius of 4 R<SUB>S</SUB> (Saturn radii); a diffuse emission that maps to a broad equatorial region from 4-11 R<SUB>S</SUB> on the nightside; and a bright ring of emission that maps to \u223c15 R<SUB>S</SUB>. With the exception of the Enceladus spot, the magnetospheric drivers for these auroral emissions are not yet fully understood. We apply a 1D spatial, 2D velocity space Vlasov solver to flux tubes mapping from equatorial radii of 4, 6, 9, and 13 R<SUB>S</SUB> to Saturn's southern atmosphere. The aim is to globally characterize the field-aligned potential structure and plasma density profiles. The ionospheric properties - the field-aligned current densities at the ionospheric boundary, energy intensity profiles and fluxes of the electrons precipitating into the ionosphere - are also determined. We then couple our results to an ionospheric model to calculate the Pedersen conductances at the foot of the relevant flux tubes. We find that for a zero net potential drop between the ionosphere and magnetosphere, there exists a sharp potential drop at \u223c1.5 R<SUB>S</SUB> along the magnetic field line as measured from the planetary center. The strength of this potential drop is approximately equal to that of the ambipolar potential resulting from the centrifugal confinement of the heavy, cold magnetospheric ion population. We also find that the ionospheric properties respond to changes in the magnetospheric plasma population, which are reflected in the nature of the precipitating electron population. For the flux tube mapping to 9 R<SUB>S</SUB> (-70\u00b0), the incident electron energy flux into the ionosphere resulting from a magnetospheric plasma population with a small fraction of hot electrons is an order of magnitude less than that inferred from observations, implying that significant high-latitude field-aligned potentials (up to 1.5 keV) may exist in the saturnian magnetosphere. Calculated ionospheric Pedersen conductances range from 3.0-18.9 mho, and are thus not expected to limit the currents flowing between the ionosphere and magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "During geomagnetic substorms, around 10<SUP>15</SUP> J of energy is extracted from the solar wind and processed by the Earth's magnetosphere. Prior to the onset of substorm expansion phases, this energy is thought to be largely stored as an increase in the magnetic field in the magnetotail lobes. However, how, when, and where this energy is stored and released within the magnetotail is unclear. Using data from the Cluster spacecraft and substorm onsets from Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet (SOPHIE), we examine the variation in the lobe magnetic energy density with respect to substorm onset for 541 isolated onsets. Based on a cross-correlation analysis and a simple model, we deduce the following: On average, the magnetic energy density increases approximately linearly in the hour preceding onset and decreases at a similar rate after onset. The timing and magnitude of these changes varies with downtail distance, with observations from the mid-tail (X\u223c-9 R<SUB>E</SUB>) showing larger changes in the magnetic energy density that occur \u223c20 min after changes in the near-tail (X\u223c-9 R<SUB>E</SUB>). The decrease in energy density in the near-tail region is observed before the ground onset identified by SOPHIE, implying that the substorm is driven from the magnetotail and propagates into the ionosphere. The implication of these results is that energy in the near-tail region is released first during the substorm expansion phase, with energy conversion propagating away from the Earth with time.",

The OSSEs are performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results from the OSSEs demonstrate that the assimilation of ionosphere observations improves the short-term (1 hr) forecasts and analyses. The OSSEs show that the short-term forecasts and analyses are further improved when the ionosphere observations adjust the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature in addition to the ionosphere electron density. Based on an initialized forecast experiment, we find that adjusting the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature also leads to improved forecast skill in the ionosphere on longer time scales (i.e., beyond 1 hr). Additionally, it is shown that using a 1 hr data assimilation cycle, and removal of second-order divergence damping in WACCMX+DART significantly improves tidal amplitudes, which were previously found to be too small. These initial results represent the first whole atmosphere data assimilation system with capabilities to assimilate observations from the troposphere to the ionosphere-thermosphere.",

         "abstract": "High-speed jets (HSJs) occur frequently in Earth's magnetosheath downstream of the quasiparallel bow shock. They have great impacts on the magnetosheath and the magnetosphere. Using two-dimensional global hybrid simulations, we investigate the formation and evolution of HSJs with different solar wind conditions. When the quasi-parallel shock is formed, HSJs begin to appear in the quasi-parallel magnetosheath. Some elongated HSJs formed at the quasi-parallel bow shock extend toward the quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath along with the background magnetosheath flow. As the elongated HSJs moves in the magnetosheath, filamentary structures of the velocity, ion density, and temperature occur in the magnetosheath. The filamentary structures are the traces of HSJs moving in the magnetosheath. Moreover, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can be excited at HSJs, which causes meandering of HSJs. When the interplanetary magnetic field is aligned to the solar wind velocity, the large-scale HSJs with a parallel (perpendicular) scale size of about 2.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> (0.3 R<SUB>E</SUB>) are formed at the magnetosheath where the \u03b8<SUB>Bn</SUB> is approaching zero. Then, some HSJs converge, leading to the formation of even larger HSJs with a parallel (perpendicular) scale size of 5 R<SUB>E</SUB> (0.6 R<SUB>E</SUB>).",

         "abstract": "The substorm onset process was studied on the basis of the vertical evolution of auroral acceleration regions derived from auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) spectra and Pi pulsations on the ground. The field-aligned auroral acceleration at substorm onset demonstrated two distinct phases. Low-altitude acceleration (h~3000-5000 km), which accompanied auroral initial brightening, prebreakup Pi2, and direct current of ultralow frequency (DC-ULF) pulsation were first activated and played an important role (precondition) in the subsequent substorm expansion phase onset. Prebreakup Pi2 is suggestive of the ballooning mode wave generation, and negative decrease in DC-ULF suggests increasing field-aligned current (FAC). We called this stage the substorm initial phase. A few minutes after this initial phase onset, high-altitude acceleration, which accompanied auroral breakup and poleward expansion with breakup Pi1 and Pi2 pulsations, suddenly broke out in an altitude range from 8000 to 16,000 km. Thus, substorm expansion onset originated in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling region, i.e., substorm ignition in the M-I coupling region. Statistical investigations revealed that about 65% of earthward flow bursts observed in the plasma sheet were accompanied by enhanced low-altitude AKR, suggesting that flow braking of bursts causes FAC and resulting low-altitude field-aligned acceleration in the M-I coupling region. On the basis of these observations, we propose a substorm onset scenario in which FAC that originated from the braking of plasma flow bursts first enhances low-altitude acceleration (substorm initial phase onset) and then the increasing FAC induces current-driven instability in the M-I coupling region, which leads to high-altitude acceleration and resulting substorm expansion phase onset.",

         "abstract": "We examined a fortuitous case of an omega band pulsating aurora observed simultaneously on the ground at Sanikiluaq in Canada and onboard the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorm (THEMIS) spacecraft on 1 March 2011. We observed almost the entire process of the generation of the omega band aurora from the initial growth to the declining through expansion period. The omega band aurora grew from a faint seed, not via distortion of a preexisting east-west band aurora. The size scale of the omega band aurora during the maximum period was ~500 km in the north-south direction and ~200 km in the east-west direction. The mesoscale omega band aurora consisted of more than 15 patches of complex-shaped small-scale auroras. Each patch contained an intense pulsating aurora with a recurrent period of ~9-12 s and a poleward moving form. The footprints of the THEMIS D and THEMIS E spacecraft crossed the poleward part of the omega band aurora. THEMIS D observed significant signatures in the electromagnetic fields and particles associated with the time at which the spacecraft crossed the omega band aurora. In particular, it was found that the Y and Z components of the DC electric field intensity, especially the Z component, modulated with almost the same period as that of the optical pulsating auroras. The electrostatic low-frequency waves of less than 30 Hz showed quasiperiodic intensity variations similar to those of the DC electric field. These observations suggest that DC electric field variation and low-frequency electrostatic waves may play important roles in the driving mechanism of omega band pulsating auroras.",

To reduce the effects observed in the cusp regions and on magnetosphere flanks, we consider these events predominantly inside the narrow cone \u226430\u00b0 about the subsolar point. Two important features of these filaments are (i) their stable antisunward (earthward) motion inside the magnetosphere, whereas the ambient magnetospheric plasma moves usually in the opposite direction (sunward), and (ii) between these filaments and the magnetopause, there is a region of magnetospheric plasma, which separates these filaments from the magnetosheath. The stable earthward motion of these filaments and the presence of a region of magnetospheric plasma between these filaments and the magnetopause show the possible disconnection of these filaments from the magnetosheath, as suggested earlier by many researchers. The results also show that these events cannot be a result of back-and-forth motions of magnetopause position or surface waves propagating on the magnetopause. Another important feature of these filaments is their rotation about the filament axis, which might be a result of their passage through the velocity shear on magnetopause boundary. After crossing the velocity shear, the filaments get a rotational velocity, which has opposite directions in the noon-dusk and noon-dawn sectors. This rotation velocity may be an important factor, supporting the stability of these filaments and providing their motion into the magnetosphere.",

We refer to such layers as \"embedded\" R1 and R2 FACs. Likely resulting from enhanced magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) convection, these FACs may indicate M-I configuration change and contribute significantly to substorm current wedges. We present several events in which embedded FACs were observed by low-altitude spacecraft in the ionosphere. All the events occurred during active geomagnetic conditions or a substorm growth phase, and most map to an equatorial location on the nightside. When an embedded FAC is upward, it coincides with inverted-V electron precipitation and a discrete auroral arc. If an upward embedded FAC is in the postmidnight-to-dawn sector, a dawnside auroral polarization stream appears immediately poleward of it, so it may be important for ionospheric heating, M-I convection, and instabilities. Our results establish embedded FACs as a frequently appearing, fundamental phenomenon for understanding and modeling the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

After the northward IMF persisted for almost \u223c19 h, a series of 11 very weak to moderate substorm expansions occurred during the following 6-h interval of northward IMF on 19 January 1998, separated from each other by a few tens of minutes. Most of these substorm expansions did not accompany significant changes of the solar wind and the IMF. As for typical substorms that occur under southward IMF conditions, spacecraft and ground-based instruments observed auroral breakups and enhancements of the westward auroral electrojet and large-scale convection in the ionosphere, together with plasmoids and dipolarizations in the magnetotail, in association with the substorm expansion onsets. These signatures suggest that the mechanism of substorm expansion onsets is the same as for typical substorms, even under prolonged northward IMF conditions. We suggest that the large IMF \u2223B<SUB>y</SUB>\u2223 affects large-scale convection and energy accumulation in the magnetotail and that the enhanced convection due to the large IMF \u2223B<SUB>y</SUB>\u2223 effect and substorm expansions can be an important factor for the promotion of succeeding substorm expansion onsets.",

         "abstract": "Throat aurora is defined as south-north aligned auroral arcs equatorward of the dayside cusp aurora and was suggested to be the results of cold magnetospheric plasma interaction with magnetopause reconnection, but its observational properties have not yet been well established. In this paper we carefully examine a sequence of throat auroras observed over Svalbard on 27 December 2003. Observations from 630.0 nm [OI] show that poleward moving throat auroras frequently show brightening followed by dimming in auroral intensity, and sometimes, the brightening throat aurora is a precursor of poleward moving auroral forms. Simultaneous all-sky images and HF radar backscatter observations along geomagnetic meridian show that the throat aurora brightening is drifting with ionospheric E \u00d7 B convection and is colocated with enhanced spectral width poleward of the convection reversal boundary (CRB), while its dimming tends to be in the vicinity of the CRB. This leads us to propose that the throat aurora brightening and dimming may be on the open and closed field lines, respectively. Particle data from NOAA 16 confirm that the dimming throat aurora is associated with precipitation of magnetosheath-like particles mixed with magnetospheric ions (&gt;30 keV), which is characteristic of the low-latitude boundary layer. For particle data from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F16, we notice that the dimming throat aurora is associated with lower fluxes of magnetosheath-like electrons accompanied with magnetospheric electrons, which is most likely on closed field lines. The dynamic properties of throat aurora presented in this paper are thus important to understand its generation mechanisms.",

         "abstract": "It has been debated for many years whether all substorm onsets are triggered by a sudden change in the solar wind. Because there is not a generally accepted definition of external triggers, a solar wind change may be identified to be an external trigger by some investigators but not a trigger by others. In this paper, we study the substorm onset from the magnetospheric state during sawtooth events. We do not try to determine whether a solar wind change around the onset is a trigger. Instead, we examine whether an external trigger from the solar wind is always necessary for substorm onset and why large changes in the solar wind do not always trigger sawtooth (substorm) onset. We have analyzed 54 sawtooth onsets and corresponding changes in the solar wind. The mean value of the total magnetic flux in the magnetotail at the sawtooth onsets is 0.98 GWb. Sawtooth onset can occur when the changes in the solar wind are very small (0.5 nPa in the solar wind dynamic pressure and 1 nT in the IMF B<SUB>z</SUB>). We have also identified a number of large changes in the solar wind without occurrence of sawtooth onset, and the mean value of the magnetotail magnetic flux is 0.74-0.79 GWb. However, the large changes in the solar wind do not cause sawtooth onset when the magnetotail magnetic flux is generally smaller than 0.8 GWb in these cases. The observations suggest that sawtooth onset will occur when the magnetotail magnetic flux is close to a critical value (\u223c1 GWb, depending on the solar wind and geomagnetic activity), no matter whether the corresponding change in the solar wind is large or small. The observations also suggest that no sawtooth (substorm) onset can be triggered by a solar wind change if the magnetotail magnetic flux is \u223c25% lower than the critical value of the onset, no matter how large the change in the solar wind is. Sawtooth onset appears to be an internal magnetospheric instability process, and a large change in the solar wind is not necessary for the occurrence of sawtooth onset.",

         "abstract": "We use a multifluid/multiscale model of Titan inside Saturn's magnetosphere to examine how Titan's induced magnetosphere and ion tail are affected when Titan crosses Saturn's magnetopause at 13:16 Saturn local time (SLT). During the simulation Titan crosses Saturn's magnetopause twice, exiting and reentering Saturn's magnetosphere. The magnetic field in Saturn's magnetosheath is predominately northward. Once inside Saturn's magnetosheath, Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetosphere is removed by slow ionospheric convection. Evidence for reconnection at Titan is not seen. Inside the magnetosheath the plasma flow is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, and magnetic field lines do not strongly drape around Titan. Titan's ionosphere is extended in the magnetosheath because Titan's ionospheric plasma is not stripped away by convecting magnetic field at high altitudes. After Titan crosses back into Saturn's magnetosphere, the magnetospheric plasma and field removes Titan's extended ionosphere, and Titan's induced magnetosphere returns to a \u201ctypical\u201d configuration. The simulation is used to determine the time scale of Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetic field lines or magnetosheath magnetic field lines after a magnetopause crossing. In the magnetosheath, slow (\u223c3 km/s) ionospheric convection removes Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetosphere in \u223c1.8 h. After Titan crosses back into Saturn's rapidly rotating magnetosphere, Titan's connection to magnetosheath magnetic field lines is removed through ionospheric convection in \u223c50 min. The results of the simulation are also compared to data from Cassini's T32 flyby.",

The three cases show discrete stable arcs, substorm aurora, and Alfv\u00e9nic aurora. The field-aligned current structure associated with each type of aurora is shown to agree with contemporary auroral models. Inverted-V type aurora with electron energy peaks of 1-10 keV are observed, and are associated with upward current regions and discrete auroral arcs seen in the all sky imagers. Downward currents are also identified and correlated with regions without visible aurora, and Alfv\u00e9nic electron precipitation is associated with mixed current regions and dynamic aurora evident in the all sky images. The substorm aurora observed also shows upward current regions and inverted-V's associated with bright spots in the ground-based images. The images shown in association with the substorm aurora correlate well with existing substorm models, including that of Akasofu [1964]. In this study we present these new ground and satellite conjunctions and use them to confirm existing theories of auroral acceleration mechanisms. Additionally, we compare the observations to existing substorm models and investigate differences between specific substorms and the various auroral forms associated with them.",

The open flux can be calculated from the area of the polar cap, delineated by the open-closed field line boundary (OCB). This study presents a superposed epoch analysis of the location of the OCB and the change in the magnetic flux content in individual nightside MLT sectors during substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases. Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the IMAGE satellite are used to derive a proxy of the OCB location. In the hour prior to substorm onset, the total nightside flux content increases by up to 0.12 GWb on average, resulting in an equatorward expansion of the OCB. Following substorm onset, the OCB contracts toward the pole as the open magnetic flux content decreases by up to 0.14 GWb on average, but the rate of decrease of the total nightside open flux content differs by 5-66% between the three IMAGE far ultraviolet instruments. The OCB does not contract poleward uniformly in all nightside magnetic local time (MLT) sectors after substorm onset. Close to the substorm onset MLT sector, the OCB contracts immediately following substorm onset; however, the OCB in more dawnward and duskward MLT sectors continues to expand equatorward for up to 120 minutes after substorm onset. Despite the continued increase in flux in these sectors after substorm onset, the total nightside flux content decreases immediately at substorm onset, indicating that the nightside reconnection rate exceeds the dayside rate following substorm onset.",

We found that the onset was preceded sequentially by enhanced polar cap flows heading equatorward near the polar cap boundary, and then by tail fast flows from the mid-tail to the near-Earth region. We also observed in situ fluctuations in short-period Pi2 band (\u223c30-50 s) in both the magnetic field and plasma pressure during the initial couple of min of the fast flows, occurring nearly simultaneously with the dipolarization and the fast flows and propagating earthward. Our results suggest that these fluctuations may be triggered by the fast flows, and may play an important role in the substorm onset process. Our event suggests that localized tail reconnection may be triggered by the enhanced polar cap flows, though the reconnection location cannot be unambiguously determined. Earthward fast flows are generated as a result of the tail reconnection and reach the inner magnetosphere to initiate the substorm onset. The presented case is consistent with that predicted by the Nishimura et al. (2010a) scenario.",

Inner magnetospheric plasma undergoes self-consistent interactions with global electric and magnetic fields. Waves excited in the inner magnetosphere from unstable particle distributions can provide energy exchange between different particle populations in the inner magnetosphere and affect the ring current and radiation belt dynamics. The ionosphere serves as an energy sink and feeds the magnetosphere back through the cold plasma outflow. The precipitating inner magnetospheric particles influence the ionosphere and upper atmospheric chemistry and affect climate. Satellite measurements and theoretical studies have advanced our understanding of the dynamics of various plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere. However, our knowledge of the coupling processes among the plasmasphere, ring current, radiation belts, global magnetic and electric fields, and plasma waves generated within these systems is still incomplete. This special issue incorporates extended papers presented at the Inner Magnetosphere Coupling III conference held 23-27 March 2015 in Los Angeles, California, USA, and includes modeling and observational contributions addressing interactions within different plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere (plasmasphere, ring current, and radiation belts), coupling between fields and plasma populations, as well as effects of the inner magnetosphere on the ionosphere and atmosphere.",

We present a detailed study on the substorm expansion behavior on 3 November 1998, using the global auroral images from Polar and the conjugate central plasma sheet data from Geotail in the near-Earth tail. The closer inspection of the auroral data enables us to characterize the stepwise feature of the auroral evolution, which were found to be spatially and temporally separable into two intense auroral activities: the initial brightening of the substorm arc and the second aurora that took place eastward of the first one with the time delay of 4.5 min. Comparing the near-Earth tail observation of the fast plasma flow, we show that the observed time lag of 4.5 min can be explained by a systematic chain of plasma processes in the central plasma sheet, indicating that this time delay can be interpreted as a generic behavior. The generality of the stepwise evolution within the expected time lag of 2-6 min is also pursued, and is found for three out of six substorms.

         "abstract": "To understand the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) disturbances, it is necessary to know the change in the null-separator structure along with the development of convection. The present paper explains this proposition by taking the case of the theta aurora that occurs after the switch of interplanetary magnetic field By and reveals auroral development inside the polar cap. The interplanetary magnetic field change is followed by the reformation of the null-separator structure to cause a convection transient and a successive deformation of separatrices inside the magnetosphere, where separatrices separate the space into different volumes that include different types of magnetic field lines, and intersections of separatrices form separators that connect nulls. By the reconnection on the separator, energy inflow occurs from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. Convection driven by this energy transports nulls. In the case of theta aurora, two new nulls on the dayside coexist with two old nulls carried toward the tail by convection. Each set of nulls generates two open-closed boundaries (separatrices) bounded by separators. Thus, open-closed boundaries are divide into four parts. Separatrices generated by different sets partially become side by side near the nightside stem limes. The theta aurora is generated at the area corresponding to the low-latitude side with respect to both of two boundaries. Thus, the occurrence of the theta aurora is a natural consequence of a transition in the null-separator structure. The present example indicates that the global structure of the magnetosphere is almost decided from the skeleton of nulls.",

         "abstract": "About 40 years after the discovery of the substorm, auroral observations were used to propose that substorm onset was triggered in the inner plasmas sheet (equatorward portion of the auroral oval) by an intrusion of the low entropy plasma by plasma sheet flow channels. Longitudinal localization makes such flow channels difficult to observe with sparse spacecraft, but they can be seen in the ionosphere via the broader, two dimensional coverage by ground based radars. We have analyzed all eight substorm auroral onset events with appropriate auroral and Poker Flat radar viewing during a radar campaign. These, together with five previously analyzed events provide evidence that intruding flow channels play an important role in substorm onsets. That the flux tube integrated entropy of this new plasma must be lower than that of the surrounding plasma implies that the change in the entropy distribution within the plasma sheet gives rises to the substorm onset instability that is seen via the growing auroral and electromagnetic waves seen with substorm auroral onset. Our analysis also adds to previous evidence that the flow channels leading to onset move into the plasma sheet/auroral oval from the open polar cap region of the magnetotail lobes/polar caps, that these flow channels move across the polar cap following their origin near the dayside boundary of the polar cap, and that substantial ground magnetic depressions associated with substorm do not occur with substorm onset but instead occur a few to several minutes later in association with expansion phase streamers.",

Magnetospheric EMIC waves had a maximum occurrence frequency in the afternoon sector and shifted equatorward during the expansion phase and poleward during the recovery phase. However, ionospheric waves in subauroral regions occurred more frequently in the nighttime than during the day and exhibited less obvious latitudinal movements. During the main phase, dayside EMIC waves occurred in both the ionosphere and magnetosphere in response to the dramatic increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure. Waves were absent in the magnetosphere and ionosphere around the minimum SYM-H. During the early recovery phase, He<SUP>+</SUP> band EMIC waves were observed in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. During the late recovery phase, H<SUP>+</SUP> band EMIC waves emerged in response to enhanced earthward convection during substorms in the premidnight sector. The occurrence of EMIC waves in the noon sector was affected by the intensity of substorm activity. Both ionospheric wave frequency and power were higher in the summer hemisphere than in the winter hemisphere. Waves were confined to an MLT interval of less than 5 hr with a duration of less than 186 min from coordinated observations. The results could provide additional insights into the spatial characteristics and propagation features of EMIC waves during storm periods.",

On the other hand, there is a broad range of observations, including magnetometers, aurora imagers, and radars, in the ionosphere. Since the nightside ionosphere resembles the magnetotail plasma sheet dynamics projection, it can be used to monitor the tail's dynamics. A proper interpretation of the ionosphere and ground observations necessitates understanding the coupling processes between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. Here, we use the global magnetohydrodynamic simulation model, OpenGGCM-CTIM-RCM, to investigate these coupling processes during periods when the magnetic flux is transported through the tail via narrow fast flow channels, typically called bursty bulk flows (BBFs). We consider three relevant states of the magnetotail: immediately before the substorm's onset, during the expansion of the substorm, and during a steady magnetic convection (SMC) event. The number of flow channels increases, and they penetrate closer to the Earth during SMC. The IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> direction influences fast flows' location but not their orientation in the plasma sheet during this event. However, the dimension of fast flows and streamers do not depend on the IMF conditions and state of the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Sprites are a potential thermal infrared radiation source in the stratosphere and mesosphere through molecular vibrational excitation. We developed a plasma-chemical model to compute the vibrational kinetics induced by a sprite streamer in the 40- to 70-km altitude range until several tens of seconds after the visible flash is over. Then, we computed the consecutive time-dependent thermal infrared spectra that could be observed from the stratosphere (from a balloon platform), high troposphere (from an aircraft), and low troposphere (aircraft or altitude observatory) using a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer model. Our simulations predict a strong production of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the (001) vibrational level which lasts at least 40 s before falling to background concentrations. This leads to enhanced emissions in the long-wavelength infrared, around 1,000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, and midwavelength infrared, around 2,300 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The maximum sprite infrared signatures (sprite spectra minus background spectra) reach several 10<SUP>-7</SUP> W/sr/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/cm<SUP>-1</SUP> after propagation through the mesosphere and stratosphere, to an observer located at 20-40 km of altitude. This maximum signal is about 1 order of magnitude lower if propagated until the troposphere. From the two spectral bands, the 1,000-cm<SUP>-1</SUP> one could be detected more easily than the 2,300-cm<SUP>-1</SUP> one, which is more affected by atmospheric absorption (CO<SUB>2</SUB> self-trapping at all altitudes and H<SUB>2</SUB>O mostly in the troposphere). With a sufficiently sensitive instrumentation, mounted in an open stratospheric balloon platform for example, the 1,000-cm<SUP>-1</SUP> band could be detected from 20-40 km of altitude.",

In order to understand the large-scale dynamic processes in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system due to the compression from the solar wind, the 17 March 2015 sudden commencement was studied in detail using global numerical models. This storm was one of the most geoeffective events of the solar cycle 24 with a minimum Dst of -222 nT. The Wind spacecraft recorded a 10-nPa increment in the solar wind dynamic pressure, while the interplanetary magnetic field B<SUB>Z</SUB> became further northward. The University of Michigan Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme global magnetohydrodynamic code was utilized to study the generation and propagation of perturbations associated with the compression of the magnetosphere system. In addition, the high-resolution electric potential and auroral power output from the magnetohydrodynamic model was used to drive the global ionosphere-thermosphere model to investigate the ionosphere-thermosphere system response to pressure enhancement. During the compression, the electric potentials and convection patterns in the polar ionosphere were significantly altered when the preliminary impulse and main impulse field-aligned currents moved from dayside to nightside. As a result of enhanced frictional heating, plasma and neutral temperatures increased at the locations where the flow speeds were enhanced, whereas the electron density dropped at these locations. In particular, the region between the preliminary impulse and main impulse field-aligned currents experienced the most significant heating with 1000-K ion temperature increase and 20-K neutral temperature increase within 2 min. Comparison of the simulation results with the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar observations showed reasonable agreements despite underestimated magnitudes.",

It implies that the magnetic field lines in the -E hemisphere are wrapped more tightly around Venus than in the +E hemisphere. Therefore, a strong field reversal region occurs in the magnetotail, which is prone to the magnetic reconnection. Since the Venus magnetotail is formed due to the solar wind interaction with the ionosphere and the ionosphere is modulated by the solar activity, it is interesting to study the solar cycle dependence of the induced magnetosphere. Here we statistically examine the Venus Express magnetotail data during solar maximum. We find that the magnetic field configuration asymmetry in Venus magnetotail is very much similar to that during solar minimum. The hemispheric asymmetry in the magnetotail persists through the whole solar cycle and magnetic reconnection in the near-Venusian magnetotail might occur during solar minimum as well as solar maximum conditions.",

The primary observations of black aurora recorded during the substorm recovery phase were between separate patches of pulsating aurora as well as pulsating aurora separated from diffuse aurora. In these observations the black aurora forms an apparent firm boundary between the auroral forms in a new behavior that is in contrast with previously reported observations. Also presented for the first time are black curls in conjunction with pulsating aurora. Curl structures that indicate shear plasma flows in the ionosphere may be used as a proxy for converging/diverging electric fields in and above the ionosphere. This new subset of black auroral behavior may provide visual evidence of black aurora as an ionospheric feedback mechanism as related to pulsating aurora.",

         "abstract": "Monochromatic all-sky imagers at South Pole and other Antarctic stations of the Automatic Geophysical Observatory chain recorded the aurora in the region where the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellites crossed the dayside magnetopause. In several cases the magnetic field lines threading the satellites when mapped to the atmosphere were inside the imagers' field of view. From the THEMIS magnetic field and the plasma density measurements, we were able to locate the position of the magnetopause crossings and map it to the ionosphere using the Tsyganenko-96 field model. Field line mapping is reasonably accurate on the dayside subsolar region where the field is strong, almost dipolar even though compressed. From these coordinated observations, we were able to prove that the dayside cusp aurora of high 630 nm brightness is on open field lines, and it is therefore direct precipitation from the magnetosheath. The cusp aurora contained significant highly structured N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> 427.8 nm emission. The THEMIS measurements of the magnetosheath particle energy and density taken just outside the magnetopause compared to the intensity of the structured N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> 427.8 nm emissions showed that the precipitating magnetosheath particles had to be accelerated. The most likely electron acceleration mechanism is by dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating along the field line. Wave-accelerated suprathermal electrons were seen by FAST and DMSP. The 427.8 nm wavelength channel also shows the presence of a lower latitude hard-electron precipitation zone originating inside the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "During space weather events, a large amount of energy and momentum from the solar wind inputs into the ionosphere-thermosphere. A critical question is that if the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction drives only the open field region in the polar caps, how the solar wind energy and momentum are transmitted to the low latitude and equatorial ionosphere. This important issue has been studied over decades and is still poorly understood, impeding space weather forecasting ability. Here we use our newly developed 2.5-D ionosphere-thermosphere simulation model that self-consistently solves the density, velocity, and temperature for electrons, multiple ion and neutral species, and electromagnetic fields to study this challenging problem. The focus of the present study is on the prompt response of the ionosphere to a convection disturbance from the polar magnetosphere. The longer time scale responses caused by the neutral winds from the polar caps will be the topic of future studies. We show that the momentum is transferred from polar to equatorial ionosphere predominately by fast magnetosonic waves, and propagation of perturbations from the source region experiences delay, damping, and substantial reflection, and the ionosphere/thermosphere behaves like a low-band-pass filter. The finding from this study sheds new insight onto coupling processes within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

         "abstract": "Traditionally, the ionosphere determination just uses American Global Positioning System and Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System dual-frequency data and has a low precision particularly on oceans. With the rapid development of Chinese BeiDou and European Galileo systems, they are playing an increasingly important role for modeling global ionosphere. Meanwhile, satellite altimetry provides valuable and precise ionosphere delay over the oceans. Through introducing priori ionosphere values from an advanced empirical ionosphere model, combining the advantages of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and satellite altimetry technologies, the precision of global ionosphere estimation can be further improved. To assess the improvement, we collect satellite altimetry data from Jason-2/3 and more than 300 global GNSS stations, the data are processed in 2014 and 2018 when the Sun is in a high and a low activity conditions. The results suggest that the ionosphere determination based on multitechnique fusion in a solar-geomagnetic reference frame is well suitable to represent the ionosphere and its structure. The determined ionosphere achieves a better global consistency, and its formal accuracy is significantly reduced. By comparing with the International GNSS Service products, evaluating by satellite altimetry measurements, and independently validating with ionosonde techniques, it is proved that the ionosphere results are further improved through employing additional available data, especially for the ionosphere over the oceans.",

         "abstract": "Several studies have shown that the surroundings of the highest Andes mountains at midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere exhibit gravity waves (GWs) generated by diverse sources which may traverse the troposphere and then penetrate the upper layers if conditions are favorable. There is a specific latitude band where that mountain range is nearly perfectly aligned with the north-south direction, which favors the generation of wavefronts parallel to this orientation. This fact may allow an optimization of procedures to identify topographic GW in some of the observations. We analyze data per season to the east and west of these Andes latitudes to find possible significant differences in GW activity between both sectors. GW effects generated by topography and convection are expected essentially on the eastern side. We use satellite data from two different limb sounding methods: the Global Positioning System radio occultation (RO) technique and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument, which are complementary with respect to the height intervals, in order to study the effects of GW from the stratosphere to the ionosphere. Activity becomes quantified by the GW average potential energy in the stratosphere and mesosphere and by the electron density variance content in the ionosphere. Consistent larger GW activity on the eastern sector is observed from the stratosphere to the ionosphere (night values). However, this fact remains statistically significant at the 90% significance level only during winter, when GWs generated by topography dominate the eastern sector. On the contrary, it is usually assumed that orographic GWs have nearly zero horizontal phase speed and will therefore probably be filtered at some height in the neutral atmosphere. However, this scheme relies on the assumption that the wind is uniform and constant. Our results also suggest that it is advisable to separate night and day cases to study GWs in the ionosphere, as it is more difficult to find significant statistical differences during daytime. This may happen because perturbations induced by GWs during daytime are more likely to occur in a disturbed environment that may hinder the identification of the waves.",

Pitch angle diffusion caused by waves in the inner magnetosphere is the primary source term for the diffuse aurora, especially during storm time. The magnetic local time (MLT) and storm-dependent electrodynamic impacts of the diffuse aurora were analyzed using a comparison between a new self-consistent version of the Hot Electron Ion Drift Integrator with varying electron scattering rates and real geomagnetic storm events. The results were compared with Dst and hemispheric power indices, as well as auroral electron flux and cross-track plasma velocity observations. It was found that changing the maximum lifetime of electrons in the ring current by 2-6 h can alter electric fields in the nightside ionosphere by up to 26%. The lifetime also strongly influenced the location of the aurora, but the model generally produced aurora equatorward of observations.",

         "abstract": "Terrestrial Very-Low-Frequency (VLF) energy from both lightning discharges and radio transmitters has a role in affecting the energetic electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts, but quantification of these effects is particularly difficult, largely due to the collisional damping experienced in the highly variable electron density in the D- and E-region ionosphere. The Faraday International Reference Ionosphere (FIRI) model was specifically developed by combining lower-ionosphere chemistry modeling with in situ rocket measurements, and represents to date the most reliable source of electron density profiles for the lower ionosphere. As a full-resolution empirical model, FIRI is not well suited to D- and E-region ionosphere inversion, and its applicability in transionospheric VLF simulation and in remote sensing of the lower ionosphere is limited. Motivated by how subionospheric VLF remote sensing has been aided by the Wait and Spies (WS) profile (Wait &amp; Spies, 1964), in this study, we parameterize the FIRI profiles and extend the WS profile to the E-region ionosphere by introducing two new parameters: the knee altitude h<SUB>k</SUB> and the sharpness parameter for the E-region ionosphere \u03b2<SUB>E</SUB>. Using this modified WS profile, we calculate the expected signals at different receiver locations from the NAA, NPM, and NWC transmitters under the full range of possible ionospheric conditions. We also describe and validate a method about how these results can be readily used to translate VLF measurements into estimates of the lower ionosphere electron density. Moreover, we use this method to evaluate the sensitivity of different ground receiver locations in lower-ionosphere remote sensing.",

Using the Naval Research Laboratory SAMI2 (Sami2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere) and SAMI3 (Sami3 is Also a Model of the Ionosphere) codes, we simulate plasmasphere refilling following a model storm, reproducing this observed phenomenon. In doing so, we find that the refilling rate and resulting pTEC values are sensitive to the oxygen profile in the thermosphere and exosphere: the supply of H<SUP>+</SUP> in the topside ionosphere is limited by the local O<SUP>+</SUP> density, through H+O+\u2192H++O charge exchange. At solar minimum, the O<SUP>+</SUP> supply simply increases with the O density in the exosphere. At solar maximum, we find that O-O<SUP>+</SUP> collisions limit the O<SUP>+</SUP> density in the topside ionosphere such that it decreases with increasing O density. The paradox occurs because the pTEC metric gives electrons in the topside ionosphere more weight than electrons in the plasmasphere.",

We discuss the location of the MR2 region (is it near, middle, and/or distant tail?) and the EO2 trigger mechanism. The upward substorm current wedge field-aligned current (FAC) and the downward FAC in the polar cap dusk sector that were both produced by different types of magnetosphere-ionosphere feedback instability are found to provide the main contribution to the system of FACs during EO1 and EO2. Also, we obtain the estimates for the EO1 and EO2 power and energy. Addressed are the variations in the tail lobe magnetic flux and their (variations) association with EO2. In addition, we describe a 3-D system of mesoscale cells, each of which involves a plasma vortex and a local FAC maximum. The cells of this system in the inner magnetosphere and in the tail lobes intensify one after other within 2 min interval. At last, we substantiate the assumption that the fast plasma flow recorded by the Cluster satellites 7 min prior to EO1 was a bursty bulk flow from the most distant tail.",

It manifests the change of the state of the magnetosphere. However, previous studies primarily focus on DEHs during geomagnetically active time (e.g., substorm). Not until recently have quiet time DEHs been reported. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the quiet time DEHs. BeiDa Imaging Electron Spectrometer (BD-IES) measurements from 2015 to 2017 are investigated. Twenty-two DEH events are identified. The DEHs cover the whole energy range of BD-IES (50-600 keV). Generally, the DEHs are positively dispersive with respect to energy. Time-of-flight analysis suggests the dispersion results from electron drift motion and gives the location where the DEHs originated from. Statistics reveal the DEHs primarily originated from the postmidnight magnetosphere. In addition, superposed epoch analysis applied to geomagnetic indices and solar wind parameters indicates these DEH events occurred during geomagnetically quiet time. No storm or substorm activity could be identified. However, an investigation into nightside midlatitude ground magnetic records suggests these quiet time DEHs were accompanied by Pi2 pulsations. The DEH-Pi2 connection indicates a possible DEH-bursty bulk flow (BBF) connection, since nightside midlatitude Pi2 activity is generally attributed to magnetotail BBFs. This connection is also supported by a case study of coordinated magnetotail observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. Therefore, we suggest the quiet time DEHs could be caused by magnetotail BBFs, similar to the substorm time DEHs.",

         "abstract": "East-west anisotropies in GOES solar energetic particle (SEP) flux observations provide evidence of a time-varying radial gradient between L \u2248 4 and L \u2248 7. During elevated auroral activity, the gradient, represented by the ratio of inner (eastward-observed) to outer (westward-observed) fluxes, exhibits undulations lasting 1-3 h. A superposed epoch analysis based on 85 geosynchronous field dipolarizations observed during 19 SEP events between 1998 and 2006 shows that &gt;4 MeV inner proton fluxes increase as the geosynchronous field stretches during substorm growth phase, then decrease gradually following field dipolarization at substorm onset. This behavior is distinct from the sharp increase of outer belt electrons and protons at the time of the dipolarization. The undulations indicate that substorm-related field changes in the near-Earth magnetotail enhance access of SEPs to the inner magnetosphere (down to L \u2248 4). The observation of undulations at geosynchronous orbit is suppressed during high solar wind dynamic pressure (P<SUB>dyn</SUB> &gt; 5 nPa) or strong geomagnetic storm conditions (Dst\u2217 &lt; -100 nT) because the radial gradient is greatly reduced under these conditions and the interplanetary flux level provides an upper limit to the SEP fluxes in the magnetosphere. A sequence of 10 SEP undulations was observed during and following the 18 April 2002 sawtooth event. Analysis of this sequence shows that undulations observed at all local times are associated with substorm-related field changes on the nightside. GOES eastward SEP observations at all local times can thus serve as global trace particle sensing of substorm-related field reconfigurations in the near-Earth magnetotail.",

         "abstract": "It is suggested that the magnetosphere tries to stabilize itself by quickly unloading the magnetic energy accumulated within its main body, when the accumulated magnetic energy exceeds a limited amount, which can be identified as the energy for the expansion phase. It is this process which manifests as the impulsive expansion phase, during which auroral arcs advance well beyond the presubstorm latitude in the midnight sector. It was shown in the previous paper that the magnetotail does not have enough magnetic energy for a medium substorm (energy 5 \u00d7 10<SUP>15</SUP> J; AE = 1000 nT). In this paper, it is shown that (1) the reason of the short lifetime (1-1.5 h) of the expansion phase is due to the fact that a limited amount of magnetic energy accumulated during the growth phase is dissipated in a period similar to the duration of the growth phase (1-1.5 h); the accumulation rate is similar to the dissipation rate during the expansion phase: (2) when the main body of the magnetosphere accumulates the magnetic energy, it is inflated; \u03b2 (= (nkT/B<SUP>2</SUP>/8\u03c0)) even at X<SUB>GSM</SUB> = -6 R<SUB>E</SUB> becomes close to 1.0 for magnetic energy (2.9 \u00d7 10<SUP>14</SUP> J) which is less than the amount consumed by a medium intensity substorm. (3) As a result, the plasma sheet current and thus the magnetosphere are expected to become unstable, unloading the accumulated excess magnetic energy and resulting in current reduction and deflation. (4) The resulting deflation can cause an earthward electric field of 5-50 mV/m, which can generate Bostrom's current system, which is mainly responsible in producing various phenomena of the expansion phase. (5) The large range of substorm intensity (AE = 100-2000 nT) is likely to be due to the location where the energy is accumulated; the closer is the distance to the Earth (X<SUB>GSM</SUB> between -10 R<SUB>E</SUB> and -4 R<SUB>E</SUB>), the more intense the substorm intensity is.",

Previously, two source regions of the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions have been proposed. The first one is the dayside polar region. Ions from the dayside polar region are transported to the lobe; then they are injected to the nightside plasma sheet during substorm expansion phase. The second one is the nightside aurora region. After the substorm onset, energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are extracted from the ionosphere with the auroral acceleration processes, and the O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are directly supplied to the nightside plasma sheet. We investigated the relative importance of these two regions on supplying the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions in the inner magnetosphere. We performed a test particle simulation in global MHD electromagnetic fields. We obtained the following results. (1) During the substorm growth phase, O<SUP>+</SUP> ions at tens of eV are extracted from the dayside polar region, resulting in the enhancement of the warm O<SUP>+</SUP> ions (hundreds of eV) in the lobe. After the substorm onset, the warm O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are nonadiabatically accelerated to tens of keV and injected to the inner magnetosphere. These O<SUP>+</SUP> ions contribute to most of the O<SUP>+</SUP> ring current. (2) O<SUP>+</SUP> ions at &lt; a few keVs are supplied from the nightside aurora region to the plasma sheet. However, their contribution to the O<SUP>+</SUP> ring current remains small. From the results, we concluded that the main source of the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions is the dayside polar region.",

         "abstract": "Bursty enhancements of hot electrons (\u22730.5 keV) with duration of minutes sometimes occur in the tail magnetosheath. In this study we used the unique simultaneous measurements from the two Acceleration Reconnection Turbulence and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun probes to investigate the likely sources, spatial structures, and responsible processes for these hot electron enhancements. The enhancements can be seen at any distance across the magnetosheath, but those closer to the magnetopause are more often accompanied by magnetosheath density and flow magnitudes changing to more magnetosphere-like values. From simultaneous measurements with the two probes being on either side of magnetopause or both in the magnetosheath, it is evident that these hot electrons come from the magnetosphere near the current sheet without further energization and that the enhancements are a result of bursty lateral magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath, the enhancements and changes in the magnetosheath properties becoming smaller with increasing outward distance from the intrusion. From limited events having specific separation distances and alignments between the probes, we estimated that a single isolated enhancement can have a thin and elongated structure as narrow as 2 R<SUB>E</SUB> wide in the X direction, as long as over 7 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the Y direction, and as thin as 1 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the Z direction. We propose that Kelvin-Helmholtz perturbations at the magnetopause and subsequent magnetosphere-magnetosheath particle mixing due to reconnection or diffusion can plausibly play an important role in generating the bursty magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath and the hot electron enhancements.",

We have found that the EUV emission intensities in the magnetosheath are highly variable from several mR to ~1200 mR and increase with the flow speed, the density, the temperature, and the He<SUP>2+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> density ratio of the solar wind; the northward IMF leads to a minimum emission in the magnetosheath, whereas the southward IMF generates a maximum emission; with the increase of the magnitude of IMF, the emission pattern in the nightside splits from single field-aligned shape into a butterfly shape around the magnetic equator; and the EUV emissions vary with the imaging positions, reflecting different latitudinal and longitudinal information of the magnetosheath. It is noted that the SWCX EUV emissions in the magnetosheath for highly disturbed solar wind conditions should be considered in processing the Moon-based plasmaspheric EUV images. We suggest that EUV imaging of the global magnetosheath requires an EUV imager with large field-of-view, high-sensitivity, large dynamic range, and low intrinsic dark count rate. This investigation could provide us with an overall understanding on SWCX EUV emissions in the magnetosheath which can potentially be used to image the global magnetosheath to study the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling in the future.",

A new method is developed for automatic detection of absorption responses to substorm onsets. Superposed epoch analysis shows that absorption exhibits some fading prior to and a clear response preceding substorm onset. These features are interpreted as being due to the stretching of magnetic field lines and a rapid dipolarization during the late growth phase of a substorm. A distinct dependence on substorm onset location is discovered with response delay increasing with distance from substorm onset and all responses to closest substorms (within 250 km) preceding substorm onset by 1-5 min. The absorption propagation is further examined using the average velocity from the onset to the riometer location as well as instantaneous velocities for a short period of time when substorm-enhanced absorption reaches the field of view. Comparison of the two velocity estimates shows that the absorption propagation is slower and oriented in more poleward directions away from substorm onset, with some evidence of near instantaneous expansion in zonal directions over large distances of \u223c2000 km from onset followed by a slower expansion primarily in poleward and westward directions. The observations suggest that during substorms precipitating electrons in the high-energy part of the spectrum behave differently from their low-energy counterparts and that they exhibit some evidence of predictable behavior.",

Here, we report a BBE event observed by the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) satellite at 1355-1359 UT, \u223c61\u00b0-66\u00b0 invariant latitudes, \u223c0600 magnetic local time (MLT), and \u223c3800 km altitude during a storm on 25 July 2004. The Double Star (DS) TC1 satellite was located near the magnetic equator at L = 5.7, close to the same local time as FAST. We investigate the acceleration process of BBEs from the inner magnetosphere to near the ionosphere by comparing electron data obtained by FAST and DS TC1. We also investigate both plasma and field variations in the inner magnetosphere associated with substorm onset using DS TC1 data to examine the relationship between the BBEs and the storm time substorm. Ground geomagnetic field data show a positive H-bay at \u223c1349 UT at \u223c0600 MLT, indicating that a storm time substorm started just before the appearance of the BBEs. At \u223c1350 UT, a tailward ion flow was observed by DS TC1. Then, DS TC1 observed a local dipolarization and a drastic ion density enhancement at \u223c1351 UT, indicating that particle heating associated with the substorm was occurring in the inner magnetosphere. From \u223c1352 UT, electron fluxes were isotropically enhanced at energies above \u223c0.5 keV as observed by DS TC1. On the other hand, the pitch angle distribution of BBEs at the FAST altitude showed field-aligned lower-energy electrons below \u223c0.5 keV and isotropic higher-energy electrons above \u223c0.5 keV. From these data, it was inferred that the BBEs might consist of two energy components due to the acceleration or heating of electrons at different altitudes in association with the storm time substorm.",

         "abstract": "In order to assess the effects of ionospheric feedback on different modes of energy transport in the magnetosphere, we investigate an isolated substorm and a steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) event with very similar solar wind drivers. The primary focus is on a comparison between the isolated substorm and the substorm that initiates the SMC. Auroral data from Polar UVI LBHl and LBHs, along with assimilative mapping of the ionosphere electrojet potential patterns are used as inputs to the global ionosphere-thermosphere model to calculate conductances and Joule heating rates. Results from this study show that the conductances both before and during the events play a large role the ability of the magnetosphere to remain in steady driven state. The substorm that initiates the SMC event shows very different signatures in the ionosphere than isolated substorm; these signatures indicate that there is very weak substorm current wedge, or possibly a pseudo-breakup.",

         "abstract": "The plasma-sheet dynamics leading to the substorm onset is analyzed from a global simulation. We calculated three cases, the normal (case 1), reduced magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling (case 2) and reduced tail dissipation (case 3). The normal solution reproduces the thinning, reconnection, tail flow, and the dipolarization in the magnetosphere, and the AU/AL, the initial brightening, the beads, the pre-onset arc, and the poleward expansion in the ionosphere. Case 2 shows that the M-I coupling promotes the thinning by evacuating magnetic field from the plasma sheet. Case 3 shows that it is implausible to reproduce the AU/AL of the expansion phase only with numerical dissipation. The projection area of the growth phase plasma sheet is so narrow that the quiet arcs on the high-latitude side are projected to the lobe. The key point to understand such narrow projection is to consider the origin of the field-aligned current (FAC). The FAC occurs to transmit motion, and particle precipitation is the consequence. The upward FACs for the quiet arc and initial brightening, which produce the substorm sequence, are generated to transmit enhanced convection from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. The substorm onset is the transmission of the convection transient. The onset FAC is generated by the near-earth dynamo. Before the onset, a two-stage reconnection occurs at the medium-tail (MTNL) and the near-earth (NENL) neutral lines through retreating nulls. The accompanying flow explains the model that assumes two causal areas for the onset in the near-earth and middle tails.",

         "abstract": "A moderately intense substorm on 1 March 2008, from 0830 to 1000 UT, observed by THEMIS probes and the Ground Based Observatory (GBO) is examined to investigate the global evolution of substorm phenomena. During this interval, all five THEMIS probes are closely aligned along the tail axis near midnight covering a radial range from \u223c9 Re to \u223c18 Re. After the substorm onset, plasma sheet expansions take place successively at multiple locations in the magnetotail as measured by different probes. The positions of the plasma sheet expansions have a tailward leap progression with an average velocity of \u223c36 km/s. There are two types of dipolarization detected in this substorm. The first type is the dipolarization front which is associated with the bursty bulk flow (BBF). While the second type, which we call \u2018global dipolarization\u2019, is associated with plasma sheet expansions. In the substorm studied, there are four intensifications as shown in the THEMIS AE index. We can detect the effects of localized and short-lived magnetic energy release processes occurring in the magnetotail corresponding to each of the four AE intensifications. Furthermore, the inner four probes can detect the global dipolarization signatures \u223c4-15 min earlier than plasma sheet expansions, while the outermost probe (P1) cannot detect this before the plasma sheet expansion. These two phenomena are caused by the same process (magnetic energy release process) but the effects detected by probes locally appear delayed. The observations in this case are not sufficient to distinguish between the two competing substorm models.",

Of the 12 Cluster-observed whistler events reported, EUV is able to provide global imaging of the plasmasphere for every event and demonstrates a direct correlation between the detection of lightning-generated whistlers beyond the plasmapause and the presence of a global perturbation of the local plasmapause. Of these 12 correlated events, seven of the Cluster-observed whistlers (or 58%) are associated with the Cluster spacecraft lying radially outward from a plasmaspheric notch. Two of the Cluster-observed whistlers (17%) are associated with the low-density region between the late afternoon plasmapause and the western wall of a plasmaspheric drainage plume. The final three Cluster-observed whistler events (25%) are associated with a nonradial, nonazimuthal depletion in plasmaspheric He<SUP>+</SUP> emission that are termed \"notch-like\" crenulations. In one of these cases, the notch-like crenulations appear to be manifestations entrained within the plasmasphere boundary layer of a standing wave on the surface of the plasmasphere. The correlated Cluster/IMAGE-EUV observations suggest that the depleted flux tubes that connect the ionosphere to the low-density regions of plasmaspheric trough and inner magnetosphere facilitate the escape of whistler waves from the plasmasphere.",

Further, analysis of ACE spacecraft measurements finds that strong wind shears in the solar wind at Earth are common. In this report GEOTAIL observations in the distant ( 200 R<SUB>E</SUB>) magnetotail are used to look for evidence of these predicted disconnection events. Three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the LFM (Lyon-Fedder-Mobary) code were run to determine the expected signatures of magnetotail-disconnection events as seen by a spacecraft. Fourty-four magnetotail entry events on the dawnside of the distant magnetotail in the years 1993-1994 were examined individually and using superposed-epoch analysis. Signatures in the GEOTAIL measurements consistent with entry into the magnetotail from the magnetosheath caused by disconnection events were seen, particularly the temporal pattern of plasma flow and the temporal pattern of the magnetic field direction. Conclusive observations of magnetotail disconnections will probably have to await having measurements with a constellation of spacecraft in the magnetotail.",

         "abstract": "The magnetospheric substorm is important not only because it involves many interesting physical processes but also because it plays a key role in the solar wind energy dissipation into the ionosphere. This paper focuses on a quantitative description of the Joule heating production rate generated during substorms by auroral electrojets that are composed of two aspects: convection electrojets and the substorm electrojet. First, the natural orthogonal component (NOC) method is carefully discussed by examining its methodology and by comparing with other mathematical techniques and ionospheric observations. It is concluded that the NOC method is a very helpful and unique method that sheds insight into the electric potential patterns in the high-latitude ionosphere. Then, using the AMIE electric potential and the NOC method, the sawtooth event on 18 April 2002 and an isolated substorm on 15 November 2001 are studied. Electric fields and Joule heating rates corresponding to the convection electrojets and the substorm electrojet, respectively, are obtained. It is found that the Joule heating associated with the substorm electrojet is only one fourth to one third of that associated with the convection electrojets during the sawtooth event. However, the former dominated the total Joule heating during the expansion phase of the isolated substorm, and the two types of the Joule heating are comparable in magnitude in the isolated substorm recovery phase.",

We find that a peculiar Region 2 field-aligned current (R2 FAC) caused by a transient dynamo is enhanced in the ionosphere and, consequently, the convection field in the ionosphere is overshielded after the northward turn of the IMF. On the other hand, in the magnetosphere, the transient dynamo appears on the lower-latitude side of the dayside cleft. This dynamo is driven by the sunward convection flow that descends the enhanced pressure slope in the cleft region. This sunward flow and the enhanced pressure are caused by the release of magnetic tension accumulated in the southward IMF interval. Simultaneously, a counterclockwise vortex on a sphere of r = 8 Re (a clockwise vortex in the equatorial plane) in the afternoon sector appears in the magnetosphere. Consequently, the overshielding potential due to the R2 FAC in the ionosphere is a counterpart of the flow vortex in the magnetosphere. Finally, we note that the effect of the \u2207B/curvature drift, which is due to the ring current particles, may be insignificant because the dynamo responsible for the overshielding appears in the higher-latitude region.",

The substorm occurrence rate is also affected by the magnitude of the B<SUB>y</SUB> component, but it is usually presumed that this contribution is independent of the sign of B<SUB>y</SUB>. Using five independent substorm onset lists, we show that substorm activity does depend on the sign of B<SUB>y</SUB> near the solstices. Specifically, we show that substorms occur more frequently when B<SUB>y</SUB> and the dipole tilt angle \u03a8 have different signs as opposed to when they have the same sign. These results confirm that the magnetosphere exhibits an explicit dependence on the polarity of B<SUB>y</SUB> for nonzero \u03a8, as other recent studies have suggested, and imply variation in the dayside reconnection rate and/or the magnetotail response. On the other hand, we find no clear relationship between substorm intensity and B<SUB>y</SUB> regardless of \u03a8. Last, for the onset list based on identifying negative bays at auroral latitudes, we observe an overall trend of more frequent onsets for positive B<SUB>y</SUB>, regardless of season. However, substorm frequency in the other four substorm lists does not exhibit an overall preference for positive B<SUB>y</SUB>. We show that this phenomenon is very likely a consequence of the particular substorm identification method (i.e., identification of negative bays), which is affected by local ionospheric conditions that depend on B<SUB>y</SUB> and \u03a8.",

The persistent electron drift loss makes the geosynchronous satellites cannot observe the substorm electron injection phenomenon during the two substorm expansion phases (06:57-07:39 UT) on that day. Behind the IP shock, the fluctuations ( 0.5-3 nPa) of solar wind dynamic pressure not only alter the dayside auroral brightness but also cause the entire auroral oval to swing in the day-night direction. However, there is no Pi2 pulsation in the nightside auroral oval during the substorm growth phase from 06:13 to 06:57 UT. During the subsequent two substorm expansion phases, the substorm expansion activities cause the nightside aurora oval brightening from substorm onset site to higher latitudes, and meanwhile, the enhancement (decline) of solar wind dynamic pressure makes the nightside auroral oval move toward the magnetic equator (the magnetic pole). These observations demonstrate that solar wind dynamic pressure changes and substorm expansion activities can jointly control the luminosity and location of the nightside auroral oval when the internal and external disturbances occur simultaneously. During the impact of a strong IP shock, the earthward movement of dayside magnetopause probably causes the disappearance of the substorm electron injections near geosynchronous orbit.",

         "abstract": "This paper describes a novel method for quantitatively and routinely identifying auroral breakup following substorm onset using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms all-sky imagers. Substorm onset is characterized by a brightening of the aurora that is followed by auroral poleward expansion and auroral breakup. This breakup can be identified by a sharp increase in the auroral intensity i(t) and the time derivative of auroral intensity i(t). Utilizing both i(t) and i'(t), we have developed an algorithm for identifying the time interval and spatial location of auroral breakup during the substorm expansion phase based solely on quantifiable characteristics of the optical auroral emissions. We compare the time interval determined by the algorithm to independently identified auroral onset times from three previously published studies. In each case the time interval determined by the algorithm is within error of the onset independently identified by the prior studies. We further show the utility of the algorithm by comparing the breakup intervals determined using the automated algorithm to an independent list of substorm onset times. We demonstrate that 50% of the breakup intervals characterized by the algorithm are within the uncertainty of the times identified in the list. The quantitative description and routine identification of an interval of auroral brightening during the substorm expansion phase provides a foundation for unbiased statistical analysis of the aurora and to probe the physics of the auroral substorm and identify the processes leading to auroral substorm onset.",

         "abstract": "We examined the magnetospheric magnetic field and plasma responses to an encounter of a discontinuity in the B<SUB>x</SUB> component of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The striking variations of simultaneous solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF-B<SUB>z</SUB> were not observed. Furthermore, we found that this IMF-B<SUB>x</SUB> discontinuity was a heliospheric current sheet, separating two high-speed solar wind streams with different velocity and magnetic polarity. In this study, the magnetic field and plasma data were obtained from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), Cluster, and GOES to investigate the magnetospheric responses, and those were taken from ACE and Geotail to monitor the solar wind conditions. Simultaneous geomagnetic field variations from the ground observatories and aurora activity from Polar were also examined. When the discontinuity encountered the magnetosphere, THEMIS-D, -E, and THEMIS-A observed abrupt and transient magnetic field and plasma variations in the dawnside near-Earth magnetotail and tail-flank magnetopause. Significant magnetic field perturbations were not observed by Cluster as located in the duskside magnetotail at this time interval. Although simultaneous dipolarization and negative bay variations with Pi2 waves were observed by GOES and the ground observatories, global auroral activities were not found. Around the dawnside tail-flank magnetopause, THEMIS-C and -A experienced the magnetopause crossings due to the magnetopause surface waves induced by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These results suggest that the magnetic field and plasma variations in the near-Earth magnetotail and tail-flank magnetopause were caused by moderate substorm-like phenomena and magnetopause surface waves. They also indicate that clear magnetospheric disturbances can be brought even without significant variations in the solar wind.",

         "abstract": "Although energetic particle injections during substorms have been observed near geosynchronous orbit since the late 1960s, how the injected particles are accelerated during a substorm is still not fully understood. Studies show that injections are associated with earthward propagating dipolarization fronts and suggest that particle acceleration can occur due to a combination of betatron acceleration during earthward convection and acceleration in the vicinity of magnetotail reconnection sites. Since observed energetic particle distributions vary from substorm to substorm, it is important to study acceleration mechanisms as a function of different substorm magnetotail configurations. In this paper, we discuss electron acceleration for two substorm events featuring different magnetotail configurations and particle acceleration processes. The study utilizes in situ observations, global MHD simulations, and large-scale-kinetic (LSK) simulations. The two substorms in question occurred on 15 February 2008 and 15 August 2001. The 15 February 2008 event was observed by the THEMIS spacecraft at x<SUB>GSE</SUB> ~ -10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, while the 15 August 2001 event was observed by Cluster spacecraft at x<SUB>GSE</SUB> ~ -20 R<SUB>E</SUB>. Earthward propagating dipolarization fronts are found in both the observations and the MHD simulations, which are driven by the solar wind conditions that existed during those events. The two simulations show that very different magnetotail configurations are formed for each event, with contrasting flows, magnetic reconnection configuration, and plasma sheet structure. We find that for the 15 February 2008 event reconnection is localized with a narrow region of high-speed flow. During this event, the electron velocity distribution functions f(v) are found to be anisotropic with f(v<SUB>\u22a5</SUB>) &gt; f(v<SUB>||</SUB>), where || and \u22a5 correspond to parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field. In contrast, for the 15 August 2001 event, there is a wide neutral line extending across the tail with low-speed flows. For this event, the distribution functions are anisotropic with f(v<SUB>||</SUB>) &gt; f(v<SUB>\u22a5</SUB>), the opposite sense as the 15 February 2008 event. We are able to relate these differences to the different magnetotail configurations seen during each event. These differences lead to contrasting occurrence rates of nonadiabatic acceleration. The differences between the magnetotail configurations during these two substorms may result from differences in the location of dayside reconnection. On 15 August 2001 the reconnection occurs on the flanks of the magnetopause, while on 15 February 2008 the reconnection occurs nearer the subsolar point.",

         "abstract": "Whether energetic electrons (10s of keV) in the magnetosheath can be directly transported into the magnetosphere and further energized through radial diffusion is significant in understanding the physical mechanisms for producing the radiation belt electrons (&gt;100s of keV) in the magnetosphere. In this study, we analyze more than two hundred magnetopause crossing events using the energetic electron and magnetic field measurements from Geotail and compare the flux and phase space density (PSD) of the energetic electrons on both sides of the magnetopause. It is found that for most of the events (&gt;70%), the fluxes and PSDs of energetic electrons in the magnetosheath are less than those in the magnetosphere, suggesting that the energetic electrons in the magnetosheath cannot be a direct source sufficient for the energetic electrons inside the magnetosphere. In fact, our analysis suggests a possible leakage of the energetic electrons from inside to outside the magnetopause. By investigating the average energetic electron flux distribution in the magnetosheath, we find that the energetic electron fluxes are higher near the bow shock and the magnetopause than in between. The high energetic electron flux near the bow shock can be understood as due to energization of electrons when they go through the bow shock. The relatively low flux of the energetic electrons in between indicates that it is difficult for the energetic electrons to travel from the bow shock to the magnetopause and vice versa, possibly because the energetic electrons near the bow shock and the magnetopause are all on open magnetic field lines and these two relatively intense energetic electron populations in the magnetosheath rarely get mixed.",

For a uniform magnetosphere the new boundary condition reduces to \u2202\u03c6/\u2202z=(\u22022\u03c6/\u2202x2+2\u2202Exi/\u2202x)/(\u03bc0VA\u03c3\u2225) and is evaluated at the magnetosphere-ionosphere interface.

         "abstract": "We investigated energy flow in the inner magnetosphere on the basis of the results obtained by a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation. When the magnetosphere is exposed to a southward interplanetary magnetic field, the magnetosphere undergoes quasi-steady convection. Downward (earthward) Poynting flux is found in the polar cap, which is consistent with previous observations. However, Poynting flux appears to be upward (antiearthward) in the equatorward region of the auroral oval. The Region 2 field-aligned current (FAC) is embedded in the upward Poynting flux region. The upward Poynting flux is closely associated with space charge deposited by the ionospheric Hall current under inhomogeneous ionospheric conductivity. The space charge gives rise to shear flow of plasma, which is transmitted upward to the magnetosphere. The shear flow generates additional Region 2 FAC, at least, in the low-altitude magnetosphere. Spatial distribution of the Region 2 FAC appears to depend on altitude, suggesting the significant influence of the ionosphere in the Region 2 FAC region. We traced integral curves of Poynting flux (S curves) backward from a magnetic field line in the Region 2 FAC region and found that the S curves originate either in the solar wind and in the earthward-most boundary of the simulation. These simulation results suggest that the ionosphere participates in the generation of the Region 2 FAC, and the ionosphere is a mediator to feed energy to the inner magnetosphere under the quasi-steady convection.",

Its occurrence indicates enhanced convection in the magnetotail that requires an upward field-aligned current from the ionosphere due to diamagnetic ion drift. Previous reports using event studies have been conflicting as to the occurrence of the Harang discontinuity during a mode of enhanced magnetotail response called steady magnetospheric convection (SMC). With a comprehensive list of SMC events from 1997 through 2007, we utilize data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network and a novel spatial superposition technique to statistically examine the occurrence of the Harang discontinuity during SMC events. We find that the statistical signature of the Harang discontinuity begins before SMC starts and strengthens as the SMC events progress. We also detail the typical size and strength of the Harang discontinuity and find that it is more pronounced during interplanetary magnetic field +B<SUB>y</SUB> conditions.",

         "abstract": "Thermal history models, historically used to understand Earth's geologic history, are being coupled to climate models to map conditions that allow planets to maintain life. However, the lack of structural uncertainty assessment has blurred guidelines for how thermal history models can be used toward this end. Structural uncertainty is intrinsic to the modeling process. Model structure refers to the cause and effect relations that define a model and are assumed to adequately represent a particular real world system. Intrinsic/structural uncertainty is different from input and parameter uncertainties (which are often evaluated for thermal history models). A full uncertainty assessment requires that input/parametric and intrinsic/structural uncertainty be evaluated (one is not a substitute for the other). We quantify the intrinsic uncertainty for several parameterized thermal history models (a subclass of planetary models). We use single perturbation analysis to determine the reactance time of different models. This provides a metric for how long it takes low-amplitude, unmodeled effects to decay or grow. Reactance time is shown to scale inversely with the strength of the dominant model feedback (negative or positive). A perturbed physics analysis is then used to determine uncertainty shadows for model outputs. This provides probability distributions for model predictions. It also tests the structural stability of a model (do model predictions remain qualitatively similar, and within assumed model limits, in the face of intrinsic uncertainty?). Once intrinsic uncertainty is accounted for, model outputs/predictions and comparisons to observational data should be treated in a probabilistic way.",

DS determined from the high negative correlation coefficient (r=-0.9) between the IMF modulus (B) and the SW density (N) on the ACE and Wind satellites at the L1 point, on the THB and THC satellites (r=-0.9) in near-Earth orbit, and on the THA satellite inside the magnetosphere is carried by the solar wind from the Sun to Earth's orbit, while maintaining its fine internal structure. Having a large size in the radial direction (\u224d763 R\u1d07, where R\u1d07 is the Earth radius), DS flows around the magnetosphere. At the same time, microDS of size \u226413 R\u1d07 passes through the bow shock and magnetopause as a magnetized plasmoid in which the ion concentration increases from 10 cm\u207b\u00b3 to 90 cm\u207b\u00b3, and the velocity decreases as it moves toward the magnetotail. When a microDS passes through the magnetopause, a pulsed electric field of ~400 mV/m is generated with subsequent oscillations with a period of T~200 s and an amplitude of ~50 mV/m. The electric field accelerates charged particles of the radiation belt and produces modulated fluxes of protons in an energy range 95-575 keV on the day side and electrons in 40-475 keV and protons in 95-575 keV on the night side. In the duskside magnetosphere (19-23 MLT), the substorm activation is observed in geomagnetic pulsations and auroras, but without a magnetic negative bay. In the post-midnight sector (01-05 MLT), a sawtooth substorm occurs without the growth phase and breakup with deep modulation of the ionospheric current and auroral absorption. The duration of all phenomena in the magnetosphere and on Earth is determined by the period of interaction between DS and the magnetosphere (~4 hrs). To interpret the regularities of the magnetospheric response to the interaction with DS, we consider alternative models of the impulsive passage of DS from SW to the magnetosphere and the classical model of reconnection of IMF and the geomagnetic field.",

We have constructed scatter plots and have computed correlation relationships between parameters relating to different levels of atmosphere. We have obtained the following results. The intensities observed in the lower and middle chromosphere are connected closer than intensities related to the upper photosphere and middle chromosphere. The structures with a stronger magnetic field are brighter at the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere levels as compared to the structures with a weaker magnetic field. K<SUB>1</SUB> minima separations are of greater value for the structures with a stronger magnetic field relative to the structures with a weaker magnetic field, whereas K<SUB>2</SUB> peaks separations demonstrate the opposite behavior. They are lower for the structures with a stronger magnetic field. It is true not only for the chosen structures belonging to quiet regions but also for the plage, though we need additional statistics for plages. The relation between shifts of K<SUB>1</SUB> minima and K<SUB>2</SUB> peak intensities for violet and red wings appeared to be weak. This may be due to the considerable contribution of random movements to the velocity field at the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere levels or due to different forming levels for the profile violet and red wings.</SUB>",

         "abstract": "The layering of the ionosphere leads to the formation of resonators and waveguides of various kinds. One of the most well-known is the ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator (IAR) whose radiation can be observed both on Earth's surface and in space in the form of a fan-shaped set of discrete spectral bands (DSB), the frequency of which changes smoothly during the day. The bands are formed by Alfv\u00e9n waves trapped between the lower part of the ionosphere and the altitude profile bending of Alfv\u00e9n velocity in the transition region between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. Thus, IAR is one of the important mechanisms of the ionosphere-magnetosphere interaction. The emission frequency lies in the range from tenths of hertz to about 8 Hz \u2014 the frequency of the first harmonic of the Schumann resonance. The review describes in detail the morphology of the phenomenon. It is emphasized that the IAR emission is a permanent phenomenon; the probability of observing it is primarily determined by the sensitivity of the equipment and the absence of interference of natural and artificial origin. The daily duration of the DSB observation almost completely depends on the illumination conditions of the lower ionosphere: the bands are clearly visible only when the D layer is shaded. Numerous theoretical IAR models have been systematized. All of them are based on the analysis of the excitation and propagation of Alfv\u00e9n waves in inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma and differ mainly in sources of oscillation generation and methods of accounting for various factors such as interaction of wave modes, dipole geometry of the magnetic field, frequency dispersion of waves. Predicted by all models of the cavity and repeatedly confirmed experimentally, the close relationship between DSB frequency variations and critical frequency foF2 variations serves as the basis for searching ways of determining in real time the electron density of the ionosphere from IAR emission frequency measurements. It is also possible to estimate the profile of the ion composition over the ionosphere from the data on the IAR emission frequency structure. The review also focuses on other results from a wide range of IAR studies, specifically on the results that revealed the influence of the interplanetary magnetic field orien tation on oscillations of the resonator, and on the facts of the influence of seismic disturbances on IAR.",

         "abstract": "The importance of the Jovian thermosphere with regard to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is often neglected in magnetospheric physics. We present the first study to investigate the response of the Jovian thermosphere to transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure, using an azimuthally symmetric global circulation model coupled to a simple magnetosphere and fixed auroral conductivity model. In our simulations, the Jovian magnetosphere encounters a solar wind shock or rarefaction region and is subsequently compressed or expanded. We present the ensuing response of the coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling terms, and the aurora to these transient events. Transient compressions cause the reversal, with respect to steady state, of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents and momentum transfer between the thermosphere and magnetosphere. They also cause at least a factor of two increase in the Joule heating rate. Ion drag significantly changes the kinetic energy of the thermospheric neutrals depending on whether the magnetosphere is compressed or expanded. Local temperature variations appear between ~-45 and 175 K for the compression scenario and ~-20 and 50 K for the expansion case. Extended regions of equatorward flow develop in the wake of compression events - we discuss the implications of this behaviour for global energy transport. Both compressions and expansions lead to a ~2000 TW increase in the total power dissipated or deposited in the thermosphere. In terms of auroral processes, transient compressions increase main oval UV emission by a factor of ~4.5 whilst transient expansions increase this main emission by a more modest 37%. Both types of transient event cause shifts in the position of the main oval, of up to 1\u00b0 latitude.",

         "abstract": "Strong ultraviolet radiation from the Sun ionizes the upper atmosphere of Venus, creating a dense ionosphere on the dayside of the planet. In contrast to Earth, the ionosphere of Venus is not protected against the solar wind by a magnetic field. However, the interaction between charged ionospheric particles and the solar wind dynamic and magnetic pressure creates a pseudo-magnetosphere which deflects the solar wind flow around the planet ( Schunk and Nagy, 1980). The combination of changing solar radiation and solar wind intensities leads to a highly variable structure and plasma composition of the ionosphere. The instrumentation of the Venus Express spacecraft allows to measure the magnetic field (MAG experiment) as well as the electron energy spectrum and the ion composition (ASPERA-4 experiment) of the upper ionosphere and ionopause. In contrast to the earlier Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) measurements which were conducted during solar maximum, the solar activity was very low in the period 2006-2009. A comparison with PVO allows for an investigation of ionospheric properties under different solar wind and EUV radiation conditions. Observations of MAG and ASPERA have been analyzed to determine the positions of the photoelectron boundary (PEB) and the \"magnetopause\" and their dependence on the solar zenith angle (SZA). The PEB was determined using the ELS observations of ionospheric photoelectrons, which can be identified by their specific energy range. It is of particular interest to explore the different magnetic states of the ionosphere, since these influence the local plasma conductivity, currents and probably the escape of electrons and ions. The penetration of magnetic fields into the ionosphere depends on the external conditions as well as on the ionospheric properties. By analyzing a large number of orbits, using a combination of two different methods, we define criteria to distinguish between the so-called magnetized and unmagnetized ionospheric states. Furthermore, we confirm that the average magnetic field inside the ionosphere shows a linear dependence on the magnetic field in the region directly above the PEB.",

         "abstract": "We have investigated MESSENGER magnetic field data from the Mercury magnetosheath and near solar wind, to identify isolated magnetic field structures (defined as clear, isolated changes in the field magnitude). Their properties are studied in order to determine if they may be considered as analogues to plasmoids and jets known to exist in Earth's magnetosheath. Both isolated decreases of the magnetic field absolute value ('negative magnetic field structures') and increases ('positive structures') are found in the magnetosheath, whereas only negative structures are found in the solar wind. The similar properties of the solar wind and magnetosheath negative magnetic field structures suggests that they are analogous to diamagnetic plasmoids found in Earth's magnetosheath and near solar wind. The latter have earlier been identified with solar wind magnetic holes. Positive magnetic field structures are only found in the magnetosheath, concentrated to a region relatively close to the magnetopause. Their proximity to the magnetopause, their scale sizes, and the association of a majority of the structures with bipolar magnetic field signatures identify them as flux transfer events (which generally are associated with a decrease of plasma density in the magnetosheath). The positive magnetic field structures are therefore not likely to be analogous to terrestrial paramagnetic plasmoids but possibly to a sub-population of magnetosheath jets. At Earth, a majority of magnetosheath jets are associated with the quasi-parallel bow shock. We discuss some consequences of the findings of the present investigation pertaining to the different nature of the quasi-parallel bow shock at Mercury and Earth.",

For a qualitative analysis of the problem the solution is obtained analytically, in the WKB approximation. The plasma cylinder boundary is assumed to have the form of a tangential discontinuity. A numeric solution was found for a more realistic model, with the boundary in the form of a smooth transition layer. This model cannot simulate such a feature of the actual magnetotail as its being divided into two lobes with opposite magnetic fields. It is capable, however, of simulating the finiteness of the magnetotail cross-section and the inhomogeneous plasma distribution over the radius. It is shown, analytically, that a local instability develops in the boundary when the velocity of the plasma flowing round the magnetosphere exceeds the Alfv\u00e9n speed at the magnetotail boundary. This conclusion is supported by a numerical solution of the problem for a model with its boundary in the form of a smooth transition layer. The instability increment, however, is much smaller in the latter case. Apart from a local instability of the boundary, unstable global modes are discovered whose amplitude practically does not vary over the magnetotail cross-section. These modes remain unstable for any, however, slow velocities of the plasma flowing round the magnetosphere. When the plasma flow velocity reaches a critical magnitude the global modes of the MHD oscillations become stable. Unstable global modes may be a source of ultra-low-frequency (\u223c1mHz) oscillations observed in the Earth's nightside magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Since the internally-generated magnetic field of Mars is weak, strong coupling is expected between the solar wind, planetary magnetosphere, and planetary ionosphere. However, few previous observational studies of this coupling incorporated data that extended from the solar wind to deep into the ionosphere. Here we use solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere data obtained by the Mars Express spacecraft during March/April 2010 to investigate this coupling. We focus on three case studies, each centered on a pair of ionospheric electron density profiles measured by radio occultations, where the two profiles in each pair were obtained from the same location at an interval of only a few days. We find that high dynamic pressures in the solar wind are associated with compression of the magnetosphere, heating of the magnetosheath, reduction in the vertical extent of the ionosphere, and abrupt changes in electron density at the top of the ionosphere. The first three of these associations are analogous to the behavior of the plasma environment of Venus, but the final one is not. These results reinforce the notion that changes in solar forcing influence the behaviors of all of the tightly coupled regions within the Martian plasma environment.",

STEREO-B downstream from Venus observed that the solar wind density at Earth orbit dropped to \u223c0.1 #/cm<SUP>3</SUP> and persisted at this value over 1 day. A similar low value was observed at Earth in 1999 and has attracted comprehensive attention (Lazarus, A.J., 2000. Solar physics: the day the solar wind almost disappeared. Science 287, 2172-2173.), especially its consequences on Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere (Lockwood, M., 2001. Astronomy: the day the solar wind nearly died. Nature 409, 677-679.). We now have an opportunity to examine the response of Venus' ionosphere to such a tenuous solar wind. After Venus Express spacecraft entered the ionosphere near the terminator, it continuously sampled O<SUP>+</SUP> dominated planetary plasma on the nightside till it left the optical shadow region when Venus Express was located at 2 R<SUB>V</SUB> (Venus' Radii) to the Venus center and 1.1 R<SUB>V</SUB> to the Sun-Venus line. Moreover, the O<SUP>+</SUP> speed was lower than the gravitational escape speed. We interpret this low-speed O<SUP>+</SUP> as a constituent of the extended nightside ionosphere as a consequence of long-duration (18 h) tenuous solar wind, because the very low dynamic pressure enhances the source and reduces the sink of the nightside ionosphere. Though the full extent of the nightside ionosphere is not known due to the limitation of spacecraft's trajectory, our results suggest that the global configuration of Venus' ionosphere could resemble a teardrop-shaped cometary ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "MAVEN spacecraft provides new opportunities for analysis of Martian environment and physical process in near-Mars space. One of interesting regions of near-Mars space is the Martian magnetosphere that is formed from mass-loaded magnetic flux tubes. There is quite detailed knowledge of the night-side magnetosphere of Mars, however the number of publications on the dayside magnetosphere are quite limited. We analyze the plasma and magnetic structure and properties of Martian magnetosphere at strong mass-loading conditions as observed on MAVEN at Mars at the solar-zenith angle of \u223c80\u00b0 on January 4, 2015. This strong mass loading of upstream flow was apparently associated with plume ions ejected from upper part of Martian magnetosphere by the solar wind motional electric field. The magnetosphere is defined by two current layers separating it from the magnetosheath at higher altitudes and from ionosphere plasma at lower altitudes. It is characterized by dominance of planetary ions which number density increases by two orders of magnitude from upper boundary to lower one. There is approximate equipartition between magnetic, ion thermal and kinetic energies through magnetosphere. The data suggest that the boundary of the magnetosphere is in pressure equilibrium with magnetosheath flow. The total energy of ion flow above (in the magnetosheath) and below (in the region of accelerated ionospheric ions) magnetosphere exceeds the magnetic energy. The upper boundary of magnetosphere was located at the place where the ratio of heavy ions and protons number densities reached \u223c0.4. Within magnetosphere this ratio continued to rise and increased by about 2 orders of magnitude at the inner boundary of magnetosphere. The heavy ion number density profile within magnetosphere suggests that it was formed by the solar wind magnetic flux tubes that reached Mars in a narrow region near the subsolar point, and then drifted around Mars to the terminator region, mass-loaded by UV-ionized upper atmosphere neutrals during this drift.",

         "abstract": "The importance of the periodicity in sunspot appearance was well recognized by the mid-19th century. Several observatories around the globe have made the record of sunspots in the form of drawings and preserved them safely for posterity. At the Kodaikanal Observatory (KO), the sunspot observations have begun in 1905. In those times observations were recorded on photographic plates and after the development of those plates in the laboratory, the drawings of the same were made on the Stonyhurst grids. In these drawings, called sun charts, different features on the sun's disk, e.g., sunspots, plages, filaments, prominences, etc. were clearly identified and visually marked with different colors. We have collected 111 years of sunspot drawing spanning over 10 solar cycles. These sunspot drawings were carefully stitched to make bound volumes, each for every 6-months. The drawings are kept at the Kodaikanal library for scientific use and analysis. In this article, we describe briefly the process of drawing, methods of counting sunspot numbers and measurement of sunspot area using square grids. We have collected the data for the northern and southern hemispheres separately. From the collected data, we compute the sunspot number and area and compare it with Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) and Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) data. The results show that the measurement of the sunspot number is underestimated by about 40%. The KO monthly averaged sunspot number data of both hemispheres is normalized with the RGO monthly averaged total sunspot number data. This procedure provided a good correlated data set that can be used for further scientific work in the future. The sunspot area data from KO is slightly underestimated in the first 5-cycles and seems mildly overestimated in the later 5-cycles. These data sets are valuable additions to the existing data of sunspot records.",

By using the combined Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) and Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) sunspot group data during the period 1874-2015, and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) of sunspot groups during the period 1974-2015, here we have found that the solar cycle pair (22, 23) violated the G-O rule because, besides during cycle 23 a large deficiency of small sunspot groups in both the northern and the southern hemispheres, during cycle 22 a large abundance of small sunspot groups in the southern hemisphere. In the case of large and small sunspot groups the cycle pair (22, 23) violated the G-O rule in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, suggesting the north-south asymmetry in solar activity has a significant contribution in the violation of G-O rule. The amplitude of solar cycle 24 is smaller than that of solar cycle 23. However, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) rate in the rising phases of the cycles 23 and 24 are almost same (even slightly large in cycle 24). From both the SOON and the DPD sunspot group data here we have also found that on the average the ratio of the number (counts) of large sunspot groups to the number of small sunspot groups is larger in the rising phase of cycle 24 than that in the corresponding phase of cycle 23. We suggest this could be a potential reason for the aforesaid discrepancy in the CME rates during the rising phases of cycles 23 and 24. These results have significant implication on solar cycle mechanism.",

         "abstract": "A number of fundamental questions as regards the physical nature of sunspots are formulated. In order to answer these questions, we apply the model of a round-shaped unipolar sunspot with a lower boundary consisting of cool plasma and with strong magnetic field at the depth of about 4 Mm beneath the photosphere, in accordance with the data of local helioseismology and with certain physically sound arguments (the shallow sunspot model). The magnetic configuration of a sunspot is assumed to be close to the observed one and similar to the magnetic field of a round solenoid of the appropriate size. The transverse (horizontal) and longitudinal (vertical) equilibria of a sunspot were calculated based on the thermodynamic approach and taking into account the magnetic, gravitational, and thermal energy of the spot and the pressure of the environment. The dependence of the magnetic field strength in the sunspot center, B <SUB>0</SUB>, on the radius of the sunspot umbra a is derived theoretically for the first time in the history of sunspot studies. It shows that the magnetic field strength in small spots is about 700 Gauss (G) and then increases monotonically with a, tending asymptotically to a limit value of about 4000 G. This dependence, B <SUB>0</SUB>( a) includes, as parameters, the gravity acceleration on the solar surface, the density of gas in the photosphere, and the ratio of the radius of the spot (including penumbra), a <SUB>p</SUB>, to the radius of its umbra a. It is shown that large-scale subsurface flows of gas in the sunspot vicinity, being the consequence but not the cause of sunspot formation, are too weak to contribute significantly to the pressure balance of the sunspot. Stability of the sunspot is provided by cooling of the sunspot plasma and decreasing of its gravitational energy due to the vertical redistribution of the gas density when the geometric Wilson depression of the sunspot is formed. The depth of a depression grows linearly with B <SUB>0</SUB>, in contrast to the quadratic law for the magnetic energy. Therefore, the range of stable equilibria turns out to be limited: large spots, with radius a larger than some limit value (about 12-18 Mm, depending on the magnetic field configuration), are unstable. It explains the absence of very large spots on the Sun and the appearance of light bridges in big spots that divide the spot into a few parts. The sunspots with B <SUB>0</SUB>\u22482.6\u00f72.7 kilogauss (kG) and a\u22485 Mm are most stable. For these spots, taken as a single magnetic structure, the period of their vertical eigen oscillations is minimal and amounts, according to the model, to 10-12 hours. It corresponds well to the period derived from the study of long-term oscillations of sunspots using SOHO/MDI data.",

         "abstract": "To better understand long-term flare activity, we present a statistical study on soft X-ray flares from May 1976 to May 2008. It is found that the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very noticeable time lag of 13, 8, and 8 months in cycle 21 respectively with respect to the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers. There is no time lag between the sunspot numbers and M-class flares in cycle 22. However, there is a one-month time lag for C-class flares and a one-month time lead for X-class flares with regard to sunspot numbers in cycle 22. For cycle 23, the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very noticeable time lag of one month, 5 months, and 21 months respectively with respect to sunspot numbers. If we take the three types of flares together, the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of soft X-ray flares have a time lag of 9 months in cycle 21, no time lag in cycle 22 and a characteristic time lag of 5 months in cycle 23 with respect to the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients of the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of M-class and X-class flares and the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers are higher in cycle 22 than those in cycles 21 and 23. The correlation coefficients between the three kinds of soft X-ray flares in cycle 22 are higher than those in cycles 21 and 23. These findings may be instructive in predicting C-class, M-class, and X-class flares regarding sunspot numbers in the next cycle and the physical processes of energy storage and dissipation in the corona.",

The \u223c6 month smoothed variation (FFT filter technique) of the total sunspot areas shows double peaks (solar maximum) with the ascending phase in each cycle for the periods 1989, 1991, 2000, 2002, 2011, and 2014. We have observed mid-term periodicity (intermediate-term) such as the Rieger-type period (\u223c120 to \u223c190 days), quasi-period (\u223c200 to \u223c380 days), and quasi-biennial period (\u223c1.20 to \u223c3.83 years) of the sunspot areas (total sunspot area, and northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun) for the combined solar cycles 22 to 24; using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Morlet wavelet transformation (WT) techniques (wavelet power spectra and contour plot). The period \u223c1.33 year of the southern hemisphere and total sunspot areas have shown the rotation rates on the basis of the convection zone. The quasi-annual period \u223c356 days is observed as an important period for the total sunspot area and the southern hemisphere and are absent in the northern hemisphere of the Sun. The periodicities of the total sunspot areas, and southern and northern hemisphere constitute the fifth, sixth and seventh subharmonic of the solar synodic rotation of \u223c27 days in the range of the Rieger-type periodicity. The 24th subharmonic of the solar synodic rotation of \u223c27 days is highly significant in the total sunspot area and the southern hemisphere of the Sun during the period of our study (1986-2016).",

         "abstract": "Sunspots are the most important indicator of the magnetic activity on the solar surface during a cycle. Every sunspot group is formed and shaped by the magnetic field of the Sun. Hence, the magnetic field intensity shows itself as the size of a sunspot group area on the surface. This shows that getting the development or evolution of sunspot groups over time means getting the change of magnetic field intensity during same interval. Here, to reveal the evolution of sunspot groups in a cycle, a method called Solar Cycle Analyzer Tool (SCAT) is presented. This method was developed as a part of Computer-Aided Measurements for Sunspots (CAMS) because the same subroutines and subprograms were used for calculations (\u00c7akmak in Exp. Astron. 38:77-89, 2014). The developed software tracks sunspot groups every day and gives them the same group number. The confirmation is made by the user to prevent counting re-formations as a continuation of an old group in the same active region. With this method, the evolution of every sunspot group can be listed for each cycle year besides other cycle features like the daily and monthly sunspot relative numbers and distribution frequency of the sunspot group types. Since 2015, SCAT is being used to get data for the annual reports of Istanbul University Observatory.",

         "abstract": "The ability to model the ionosphere accurately for single frequency users in satellite applications has gained some appreciable usage, most especially during quiet conditions in a mild (middle latitudes) ionosphere. However, solving the problem of ionosphere for single frequency user of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) region is of a great concern for space scientists and engineers. Several methodologies have been used to develop models that describe global or regional maps for ionosphere errors in order to mitigate the effect of the errors on GNSS systems. Global or regional ionosphere Maps have been known to be an efficient tool to monitor the delay introduced by the ionosphere in the satellite signals. This research uses the conventional Planar fit and ordinary Kriging methodologies to assess a regional map for ionosphere correction in equatorial African sector. The result obtained is an indication that modified Kriging methodology describes the EIA ionosphere corrections better compared with ordinary Kriging and Planar fit methodologies.",

         "abstract": "The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer spacecraft provides simultaneous spectra and images of the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona with 0.33 - 0.4 arcsec spatial resolution, two-second temporal resolution, and 1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> velocity resolution over a field-of-view of up to 175 arcsec \u00d7 175 arcsec. IRIS was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit on 27 June 2013 using a Pegasus-XL rocket and consists of a 19-cm UV telescope that feeds a slit-based dual-bandpass imaging spectrograph. IRIS obtains spectra in passbands from 1332 - 1358 \u00c5, 1389 - 1407 \u00c5, and 2783 - 2834 \u00c5, including bright spectral lines formed in the chromosphere (Mg ii h 2803 \u00c5 and Mg ii k 2796 \u00c5) and transition region (C ii 1334/1335 \u00c5 and Si iv 1394/1403 \u00c5). Slit-jaw images in four different passbands (C ii 1330, Si iv 1400, Mg ii k 2796, and Mg ii wing 2830 \u00c5) can be taken simultaneously with spectral rasters that sample regions up to 130 arcsec \u00d7 175 arcsec at a variety of spatial samplings (from 0.33 arcsec and up). IRIS is sensitive to emission from plasma at temperatures between 5000 K and 10 MK and will advance our understanding of the flow of mass and energy through an interface region, formed by the chromosphere and transition region, between the photosphere and corona. This highly structured and dynamic region not only acts as the conduit of all mass and energy feeding into the corona and solar wind, it also requires an order of magnitude more energy to heat than the corona and solar wind combined. The IRIS investigation includes a strong numerical modeling component based on advanced radiative-MHD codes to facilitate interpretation of observations of this complex region. Approximately eight Gbytes of data (after compression) are acquired by IRIS each day and made available for unrestricted use within a few days of the observation.",

         "abstract": "The Sun exhibits a well-observed modulation in the number of spots on its disk over a period of about 11 years. From the dawn of modern observational astronomy, sunspots have presented a challenge to understanding\u2014their quasi-periodic variation in number, first noted 175 years ago, has stimulated community-wide interest to this day. A large number of techniques are able to explain the temporal landmarks, (geometric) shape, and amplitude of sunspot \"cycles,\" however, forecasting these features accurately in advance remains elusive. Recent observationally-motivated studies have illustrated a relationship between the Sun's 22-year (Hale) magnetic cycle and the production of the sunspot cycle landmarks and patterns, but not the amplitude of the sunspot cycle. Using (discrete) Hilbert transforms on more than 270 years of (monthly) sunspot numbers we robustly identify the so-called \"termination\" events that mark the end of the previous 11-yr sunspot cycle, the enhancement/acceleration of the present cycle, and the end of 22-yr magnetic activity cycles. Using these we extract a relationship between the temporal spacing of terminators and the magnitude of sunspot cycles. Given this relationship and our prediction of a terminator event in 2020, we deduce that sunspot Solar Cycle 25 could have a magnitude that rivals the top few since records began. This outcome would be in stark contrast to the community consensus estimate of sunspot Solar Cycle 25 magnitude.",

         "abstract": "Historical sunspot records and the construction of a comprehensive database are among the most sought after research activities in solar physics. Here, we revisit the issues and remaining questions on the reconstruction of the so-called group sunspot numbers (GSN) that was pioneered by D. Hoyt and colleagues. We use the modern tools of artificial intelligence (AI) by applying various algorithms based on machine learning (ML) to GSN records. The goal is to offer a new vision in the reconstruction of sunspot activity variations, i.e. a Bayesian reconstruction, in order to obtain a complete probabilistic GSN record from 1610 to 2020. This new GSN reconstruction is consistent with the historical GSN records. In addition, we perform a comparison between our new probabilistic GSN record and the most recent GSN reconstructions produced by several solar researchers under various assumptions and constraints. Our AI algorithms are able to reveal various new underlying patterns and channels of variations that can fully account for the complete GSN time variability, including intervals with extremely low or weak sunspot activity like the Maunder Minimum from 1645 - 1715. Our results show that the GSN records are not strictly represented by the 11-year cycles alone, but that other important timescales for a fuller reconstruction of GSN activity history are the 5.5-year, 22-year, 30-year, 60-year, and 120-year oscillations. The comprehensive GSN reconstruction by AI/ML is able to shed new insights on the nature and characteristics of not only the underlying 11-year-like sunspot cycles but also on the 22-year Hale's polarity cycles during the Maunder Minimum, among other results previously hidden so far. In the early 1850s, Wolf multiplied his original sunspot number reconstruction by a factor of 1.25 to arrive at the canonical Wolf sunspot numbers (WSN). Removing this multiplicative factor, we find that the GSN and WSN differ by only a few percent for the period 1700 to 1879. In a comparison to the international sunspot number (ISN) recently recommended by Clette et al. (Space Sci. Rev. 186, 35, 2014), several differences are found and discussed. More sunspot observations are still required. Our article points to observers that are not yet included in the GSN database.",

         "abstract": "To better study the importance of the collision of different magnetic systems in generating magnetically complex sunspot groups and major (M- and X-class) flares, we define the index ALW: A r e a /LW, where LW represents the latitudinal width of the sunspot group band, and A r e a represents the total area of sunspot groups within the latitudinal width. Then, using the sunspot-group data collected by the United States Air Force/Mount Wilson Observatory and the flare data recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, we investigate the variations of the ALW-index, the percentage of complex sunspot groups, and the percentage of major flares in the northern and southern hemispheres during Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24. The main findings are reported as follows: First, in most cases, the maximum percentage of complex sunspot groups occurs after the maximum ALW is reached, and ALW starts to decrease. The result suggests that the collision of different magnetic systems cannot affect directly whether more complex sunspot groups are produced or more complex sunspot groups may be produced when there is a lower probability of the collision of different magnetic-flux systems, which does not support the suggestion of Jaeggli and Norton (Astrophys. J. Lett.820, L11, 2016). Second, in most cases, the maximum percentage of complex sunspot groups occurs after the maximum percentage of major flares is reached, and the percentage of major flares starts to decrease, supporting the suggestion of Nikbakhsh et al. (Astron. Astrophys.629, A45, 2019) - the large-scale dynamo peaks before the small-scale dynamo starts increasing, and the complex sunspot groups are linked to the small-scale dynamo taking over after the large-scale dynamo starts decreasing.",

         "abstract": "Forecasting of solar activity is extremely important, due to its impact on our space-based technology. In recent years, we have observed a continuous decline in the peak sunspot number for Solar Cycles (SCs) 21 to 24. We are more curious about peak activity of SC 25 because if the solar activity weakens further, then it may be an indication of new extended minima. So far, the daily sunspot-number data make up the longest observational series of the solar activity available, and recently this has been replaced with the corrected new Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. In general, different prediction models are available to forecast the peak smoothed sunspot number (SSN) of the upcoming SC but they are based on the older Version 1.0 sunspot data. Therefore, it is necessary to check the applicability of earlier proposed models to predict the peak SSN using the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. Here, we re-evaluate one such earlier proposed prediction model, which is based on the estimates of the Shannon entropy, a measure of randomness, for Version 2.0 sunspot data. We find that this prediction model is applicable to the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. To verify the robustness of the prediction model, we used the histogram and additionally the kernel density estimator (KDE) method to calculate the probability distribution function (PDF). The estimate of the PDF is a prerequisite to compute the Shannon entropy. We found that the prediction model is robust and the correlation coefficients between model parameters are 0.93 and 0.92, respectively, for these two approaches. This exercise provides a new prediction model for the peak SSN based on the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. The model forecasts the peak smoothed sunspot number of 136.9 \u00b124 using a histogram-derived PDF and 150.7 \u00b125 using a KDE-derived PDF for the upcoming SC 25. These predictions for SC 25 are more reliable as up to date (December 2020) sunspot-number data have been utilized to get the entropy in the end phase of SC 24. It suggests that SC 25 would be similar or slightly stronger than SC 24.",

         "abstract": "We compare horizontal flow fields in the photosphere and in the subphotosphere (a layer 0.5 Mm below the photosphere) in two solar active regions: AR 11084 and AR 11158. AR 11084 is a mature, simple active region without significant flaring activity, and AR 11158 is a multipolar, complex active region with magnetic flux emerging during the period studied. Flows in the photosphere are derived by applying the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) on HMI-observed vector magnetic fields, and the subphotospheric flows are inferred by time-distance helioseismology using HMI-observed Dopplergrams. Similar flow patterns are found for both layers for AR 11084: inward flows in the sunspot umbra and outward flows surrounding the sunspot. The boundary between the inward and outward flows, which is slightly different in the photosphere and the subphotosphere, is within the sunspot penumbra. The area having inward flows in the subphotosphere is larger than that in the photosphere. For AR 11158, flows in these two layers show great similarities in some areas and significant differences in other areas. Both layers exhibit consistent outward flows in the areas surrounding sunspots. On the other hand, most well-documented flux-emergence-related flow features seen in the photosphere do not have counterparts in the subphotosphere. This implies that the horizontal flows caused by flux emergence do not extend deeply into the subsurface.",

We have compared the results from the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the maximum entropy method (MEM), and the Morlet wavelet power-spectra of the equatorial rotation rates determined from SOON and DPD sunspot-group data during the period 1986 - 2007 with those of the Mount Wilson Doppler-velocity data during the same period determined by Javaraiah et al. ( Solar Phys. 257, 61, 2009). We have also compared the power-spectra computed from the DPD and the combined GPR and SOON sunspot-group data during the period 1974 - 2014 to those from the GPR sunspot-group data during the period 1931 - 1973. Our results suggest a \u223c 250-day period in the equatorial rotation rate determined from both the Mt. Wilson Doppler-velocity data and the sunspot-group data during 1986 - 2007. However, a wavelet analysis reveals that this periodicity appears mostly around 1991 in the velocity data, while it is present in most of the solar cycles covered by the sunspot-group data, mainly near the minimum epochs of the solar cycles. We also found the signature of a period of \u223c 1.4 years in the velocity data during 1990 - 1995, and in the equatorial rotation rate of sunspot groups mostly around the year 1956. The equatorial rotation rate of sunspot groups reveals a strong \u223c 1.6-year periodicity around 1933 and 1955, a weaker one around 1976, and a strong \u223c 1.8-year periodicity around 1943. Our analysis also suggests periodicities of \u223c 5 years, \u223c 7 years, and \u223c 17 years, as well as some other short-term periodicities. However, short-term periodicities are mostly present at the time of solar minima. Hence, short-term periodicities cannot be confirmed because of the larger uncertainty in the data.",

         "abstract": "The Maunder Minimum (1645 - 1715) was unique in terms of solar-cycle amplitudes and sunspot-position distributions registered in the last four centuries; however, little is known for its recovery and transition to the regular solar cycles until 1749 and the existing reconstructions vary from one to another here. This article presents a snapshot of Solar Cycle \u22123 including sunspot observations by Johann Christoph M\u00fcller (hereafter, JCM) in 1719 - 1720. We identified his sunspot drawings in the manuscript department of the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg and compiled his biographical profile and observational expertise. Subsequently, we analysed his sunspot drawings and derived the group number and positions of the observed sunspots. The results and comparative analyses with contemporary observations revealed that JCM reported up to five sunspot groups, corresponding well with Sebastian Alischer's records but contrasting with Johann Rost's records in the existing databases. These comparisons indicated that Rost's extremely large values recorded in 1719 - 1720 probably represented individual sunspot numbers instead of sunspot group numbers, unlike the understanding in the existing databases. Accordingly, JCM's group number forms a robust reference for representing the solar activity in 1719 - 1720 and exhibits relatively moderate solar cycle amplitude in the immediate aftermath of the Maunder Minimum. Moreover, JCM's sunspot drawings provide significantly detailed information on sunspot positions. Our analyses could locate the reported sunspot groups in both solar hemispheres, unlike those in the Maunder Minimum, which support the suggested transition between Solar Cycles \u22124 and \u22123.",

They are rapid high-amplitude magnetic field rotations sharing properties of nonlinear Alfv\u00e9n waves and plane plasma slabs. They are believed to play an important role in the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. Most studies of solar wind discontinuities are based on observations in pristine solar wind, often by solar wind monitors at L1. However, before interacting with the Earth's magnetosphere, solar wind discontinuities cross the bow shock and can change their properties. In this study, we investigate the transformation of discontinuities due to the bow shock crossing. We compiled a set of 100 high-amplitude (&gt;3 nT) discontinuities observed by ARTEMIS in the upstream of the bow shock and by THEMIS in the downstream from the bow shock crossing (in the Earth's magnetosheath). Comparison of discontinuity properties in the solar wind and magnetosheath demonstrates discontinuity thinning and current density increase in the magnetosheath. Although all considered solar wind discontinuities mostly resemble rotational discontinuities, in the magnetosheath they start having properties of tangential discontinuities. We reveal a clear dawn-dusk asymmetry of discontinuity properties that are likely related to the asymmetry of the ion foreshock. We discuss how solar wind discontinuity transformation at the bow shock crossing can alter their interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.",

(Solar Phys.289, 4365, 2014b) to separate sunspot groups into large sunspot groups (D, E, and F classes in the modified Zurich classification) and simple sunspot groups (A and B classes) in Solar Cycles 22 - 24 collected by the United States Air Force/Mount Wilson Observatory (USAF/MWL). Then, using lagged-cross-correlation analysis and the block-bootstrap method, we calculate the correlation coefficients against time lags and determine the statistical significance of phase relation between large and simple sunspot groups in Solar Cycles 22 - 24, respectively. The main results that we obtained are summarized as follows: i) During Solar Cycles 22 and 24, the results - large sunspot groups lead or lag simple sunspot groups - are statistically insignificant and large sunspot groups should be in phase with simple sunspot groups. ii) During Solar Cycle 23, large sunspot groups statistically significantly lag simple sunspot groups in temporal phase.",

         "abstract": "We analyze the multiwavelength observations of an M2.9/1N flare that occurred in the active region (AR) NOAA 11112 in the vicinity of a huge filament system on 16 October 2010. SDO/HMI magnetograms reveal the emergence of a bipole (within the existing AR) 50 hours prior to the flare event. During the emergence, both the positive and negative sunspots in the bipole show translational as well as rotational motion. The positive-polarity sunspot shows significant motion/rotation in the south-westward/clockwise direction, and we see continuously pushing/sliding of the surrounding opposite-polarity field region. On the other hand, the negative-polarity sunspot moves/rotates in the westward/anticlockwise direction. The positive-polarity sunspot rotates \u2248 70<SUP>\u2218</SUP> within 30 hours, whereas the one with negative polarity rotates \u2248 20<SUP>\u2218</SUP> within 10 hours. SDO/AIA 94 \u00c5 EUV images show the emergence of a flux tube in the corona, consistent with the emergence of the bipole in HMI. The footpoints of the flux tube were anchored in the emerging bipole. The initial brightening starts at one of the footpoints (western) of the emerging loop system, where the positive-polarity sunspot pushes/slides towards a nearby negative-polarity field region. A high speed plasmoid ejection (speed \u2248 1197 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) was observed during the impulsive phase of the flare, which suggests magnetic reconnection of the emerging positive-polarity sunspot with the surrounding opposite-polarity field region. The entire AR shows positive-helicity injection before the flare event. Moreover, the newly emerging bipole reveals the signature of a negative (left-handed) helicity. These observations provide unique evidence of the emergence of twisted flux tubes from below the photosphere to coronal heights, triggering a flare mainly due to the interaction between the emerging positive-polarity sunspot and a nearby negative-polarity sunspot by the shearing motion of the emerging positive sunspot towards the negative one. Our observations also strongly support the idea that the rotation can most likely be attributed to the emergence of twisted magnetic fields, as proposed by recent models.",

         "abstract": "Antonio Colla was a meteorologist and astronomer who made sunspot observations at the Meteorological Observatory of the Parma University (Italy). He carried out his sunspot observations from 1830 to 1843, just after the Dalton Minimum. We have recovered 71 observation days for this observer. Unfortunately, many of these records are qualitative and we could only obtain the number of sunspot groups and/or single sunspots from 25 observations. However, we highlight the importance of these records because Colla is not included in the sunspot group database as an observer and, therefore, neither are his sunspot observations. With regards to the number of groups, the sunspot observations made by Colla are similar to those of several observers of his time. For common observation days, only Stark recorded significantly more groups than Colla. Moreover, we have calculated the sunspot areas and positions from Colla's sunspot drawings concluding that both areas and positions recorded by this observer seem unreal. Therefore, Colla's drawings can be interpreted such as sketches showing reliable information on the number of groups but the information on sunspot areas and positions should not be used for scientific purposes.",

         "abstract": "Large sunspots can be observed with the unaided eye under suitable atmospheric seeing conditions. Such observations are of particular value because the frequency of their appearance provides an approximate indication of the prevailing level of solar activity. Unaided-eye sunspot observations can be traced back well before the start of telescopic observations of the Sun, especially in the East Asian historical records. It is therefore important to compare more modern, unaided-eye sunspot observations with the results of telescopic sunspot observations, to gain a better understanding of the nature of the unaided-eye sunspot records. A previous comparison of Chinese unaided-eye sunspot records and Greenwich photo-heliographic results between 1874 and 1918 indicated that a few of the unaided-eye observations were apparently not supported by direct photographic evidence of at least one sunspot with a large area. This article reveals that one of such Chinese unaided-eye observations had possibly captured the transit of Venus on 9 December 1874. The Chinese sunspot records on this date are compared with Western sunspot observations on the same day. It is concluded that sunspots on the solar disk were quite small and the transit of Venus was probably misinterpreted as a sunspot (black spot) by the Chinese local intellectuals. This case indicates that sunspots or comparable \"obscuring\" objects with an area as large as 1000 millionths of the solar disk could reasonably have been seen with the unaided eye under suitable seeing conditions. It also confirms the visibility of sunspots near the solar limb with the unaided eye. This study provides an explanation of the apparent discrepancy between the Chinese unaided-eye sunspot observation on 9 December 1874 and the Western sunspot observations using telescopes, as well as a basis for further discussion on the negative pairs in 1900 and 1911, apparently without sufficiently large area.",

A large portion (up to \u2248 30<SUP>\u2218</SUP> latitude) of the mean differential-rotation profile of the sunspot groups lies between those of the internal differential-rotation rates at 0.94R<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and 0.98R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. The variation in the yearly mean equatorial-rotation rate of the sunspot groups seems to be lagging behind that of the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the GONG measurements by one to two years. The amplitude of the GONG measurements is very small. The solar-cycle variation in the equatorial-rotation rate of the solar corona closely matches that determined from the sunspot-group data. The variation in the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the Mount Wilson Doppler-velocity data closely resembles the corresponding variation in the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the sunspot-group data that included the values of the abnormal angular motions (&gt; |3<SUP>\u2218</SUP>| day<SUP>-1</SUP>) of the sunspot groups.

         "abstract": "We investigate how helioseismic waves that originate from effective point sources interact with a sunspot. These waves are reconstructed from observed stochastic wavefields on the Sun by cross-correlating photospheric Doppler-velocity signals. We select the wave sources at different locations relative to the sunspot, and investigate the p- and f-mode waves separately. The results reveal a complicated picture of waveform perturbations caused by the wave interaction with the sunspot. In particular, it is found that for waves originating from outside of the sunspot, p-mode waves travel across the sunspot with a small amplitude reduction and slightly higher speed, and wave amplitude and phase get mostly restored to the quiet-Sun values after passing the sunspot. The f-mode wave experiences some amplitude reduction passing through the sunspot, and the reduced amplitude is not recovered after that. The wave-propagation speed does not change before encountering the sunspot and inside the sunspot, but the wavefront becomes faster than the reference wave after passing through the sunspot. For waves originating from inside the sunspot umbra, both f- and p-mode waves show significant amplitude reductions and faster speed for all propagation paths. A comparison of positive and negative time lags of cross-correlation functions shows an apparent asymmetry in the waveform changes for both the f- and p-mode waves. We suggest that the waveform variations of the helioseismic waves interacting with a sunspot found in this article can be used for developing a method of waveform heliotomography, similar to the waveform tomography of the Earth.",

The comparisons are made for the original Solar Influences Data Center (SIDC) composite of Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number [R_{{ISNv}1}], the group sunspot number [R<SUB>G</SUB>] by Hoyt and Schatten ( Solar Phys. 181, 491, 1998), the new \"backbone\" group sunspot number [R_{BB}] by Svalgaard and Schatten ( Solar Phys., DOI: 10.1007/s11207-015-0815-8, 2016), and the \"corrected\" sunspot number [R<SUB>C</SUB>] by Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard ( J. Geophys. Res. 119, 5172, 2014a). Each sunspot number is fitted with terrestrial observations, or parameters derived from terrestrial observations to be linearly proportional to sunspot number, over a 30-year calibration interval of 1982 - 2012. The fits are then used to compute test sequences, which extend further back in time and which are compared to R_{{ISNv}1}, R<SUB>G</SUB>, R_{{BB}}, and R<SUB>C</SUB>. To study the long-term trends, comparisons are made using averages over whole solar cycles (minimum-to-minimum). The test variations are generated in four ways: i) using the IDV(1d) and IDV geomagnetic indices (for 1845 - 2013) fitted over the calibration interval using the various sunspot numbers and the phase of the solar cycle; ii) from the open solar flux (OSF) generated for 1845 - 2013 from four pairings of geomagnetic indices by Lockwood et al. ( Ann. Geophys. 32, 383, 2014a) and analysed using the OSF continuity model of Solanki, Sch\u00fcssler, and Fligge ( Nature, 408, 445, 2000), which employs a constant fractional OSF loss rate; iii) the same OSF data analysed using the OSF continuity model of Owens and Lockwood ( J. Geophys. Res. 117, A04102, 2012), in which the fractional loss rate varies with the tilt of the heliospheric current sheet and hence with the phase of the solar cycle; iv) the occurrence frequency of low-latitude aurora for 1780 - 1980 from the survey of Legrand and Simon ( Ann. Geophys. 5, 161, 1987). For all cases, R_{BB} exceeds the test terrestrial series by an amount that increases as one goes back in time.",

         "abstract": "The daily number of sunspot groups on the solar disk, as recorded by the programme of sunspot observations performed under the aegis of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, UK, and subsequently the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), is re-examined for the interval 1874 - 1885. The motivation for this re-examination is the key role that the RGO number of sunspot groups plays in the calculation of Group Sunspot Numbers (Hoyt and Schatten in Solar Phys. 179, 189, 1998a; Solar Phys. 181, 491, 1998b). A new dataset has been derived for the RGO daily number of sunspot groups in the interval 1874 - 1885. This new dataset attempts to achieve complete consistency between the sunspot data presented in the three main sections of the RGO publications and also incorporates all known errata and additions. It is argued that days for which no RGO solar photograph was acquired originally should be regarded, without exception, as being days without meaningful sunspot data. The daily number of sunspot groups that Hoyt and Schatten assign to days without RGO photographs is frequently just a lower limit. Moreover, in the absence of a solar photograph, the daily number of sunspot groups is inevitably uncertain because of the known frequent occurrence of sunspot groups that exist for just a single day. The elimination of days without photographs changes the list of inter-comparison days on which both the primary RGO observer and a specified secondary comparison observer saw at least one sunspot group. The resulting changes in the personal correction factors of secondary observers then change the personal correction factors of overlapping tertiary observers, etc. In this way, numerical changes in the personal correction factors of secondary observers propagate away from the interval 1874 - 1885, thereby potentially changing the arithmetical calculation of Group Sunspot Numbers over an appreciably wider time interval.",

The data series tested are the original and new versions of the Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number composite [R_{{ISNv1}} and R_{{ISNv2}}] (respectively Clette et al. in Adv. Space Res. 40, 919, 2007 and Clette et al. in The Solar Activity Cycle 35, Springer, New York, 2015); the corrected version of R <SUB>ISNv1</SUB> proposed by Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard ( J. Geophys. Res. 119, 5193, 2014a) [R <SUB>C</SUB>]; the new \"backbone\" group-number composite proposed by Svalgaard and Schatten ( Solar Phys. 291, 2016) [R_{{BB}}]; and the new group-number composite derived by Usoskin et al. ( Solar Phys. 291, 2016) [R_{{UEA}}]. The test data series used are the group-number [N<SUB>G</SUB>] and total sunspot area [A <SUB>G</SUB>] from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich/Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) photoheliographic data; the Ca K index from the recent re-analysis of Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) spectroheliograms in the Calcium ii K ion line; the sunspot-group-number from the MWO sunspot drawings [N_{{MWO}}]; and the dayside ionospheric F2-region critical frequencies measured by the Slough ionosonde [foF2]. These test data all vary in close association with sunspot numbers, in some cases non-linearly. The tests are carried out using both the before-and-after fit-residual comparison method and the correlation method of Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard, applied to annual mean data for intervals iterated to minimise errors and to eliminate uncertainties associated with the precise date of the putative discontinuity. It is not assumed that the correction required is by a constant factor, nor even linear in sunspot number. It is shown that a non-linear correction is required by R<SUB>C</SUB>, R_{BB}, and R_{{ISNv1}}, but not by R_{{ISNv2}} or R_{{UEA}}. The five test datasets give very similar results in all cases. By multiplying the probability distribution functions together, we obtain the optimum correction for each sunspot dataset that must be applied to pre-discontinuity data to make them consistent with the post-discontinuity data. It is shown that, on average, values for 1932 - 1943 are too low (relative to later values) by about 12.3 % for R_{{ISNv1}} but are too high for R_{{ISNv2}} and R_{BB} by 3.8 % and 5.2 %, respectively. The correction that was applied to generate R<SUB>C</SUB> from R <SUB>ISNv1</SUB> reduces this average factor to 0.5 % but does not remove the non-linear variation with the test data, and other errors remain uncorrected. A valuable test of the procedures used is provided by R_{{UEA}}, which is identical to the RGO N<SUB>G</SUB> values over the interval employed.",

Using historic datasets from the Slough and Washington ionosondes, we evaluate the best statistical fits of foF2 to sunspot numbers (at each Universal Time [UT] separately) in order to search for drifts and abrupt changes in the fit residuals over Solar Cycles 17 - 21. This test is carried out for the original composite of the Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number [R], the new \"backbone\" group sunspot number [R_{BB}], and the proposed \"corrected sunspot number\" [R<SUB>C</SUB>]. Polynomial fits are made both with and without allowance for the white-light facular area, which has been reported as being associated with cycle-to-cycle changes in the sunspot-number-foF2 relationship. Over the interval studied here, R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> largely differ in their allowance for the \"Waldmeier discontinuity\" around 1945 (the correction factor for which for R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> is, respectively, zero, effectively over 20 %, and explicitly 11.6 %). It is shown that for Solar Cycles 18 - 21, all three sunspot data sequences perform well, but that the fit residuals are lowest and most uniform for R_{BB}. We here use foF2 for those UTs for which R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> all give correlations exceeding 0.99 for intervals both before and after the Waldmeier discontinuity. The error introduced by the Waldmeier discontinuity causes R to underestimate the fitted values based on the foF2 data for 1932 - 1945, but R_{BB} overestimates them by almost the same factor, implying that the correction for the Waldmeier discontinuity inherent in R_{BB} is too large by a factor of two. Fit residuals are smallest and most uniform for R<SUB>C</SUB>, and the ionospheric data support the optimum discontinuity multiplicative correction factor derived from the independent Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) sunspot group data for the same interval.",

The radial and vertical profiles of pressure, plasma density, and temperature in the visible layers of the sunspot are calculated. The reduction in plasma density in the magnetic funnel of the sunspot, corresponding to the Wilson depression, is also obtained. The magnetic structure of the sunspot is given analytically in a realistic way: a part of the magnetic flux of the sunspot approaches the surrounding photosphere at the outer edge of the penumbra. The magnetic field of the sunspot is not assumed to be axially symmetric. For the first time, the angular dependence of the physical variables in this model allows us to simulate not only a deviation from the circular shape of the sunspot, but also a fine filamentary structure of the sunspot penumbra. The Alfv\u00e9n Mach number (the ratio of the plasma speed to the Alfv\u00e9n speed) is zero at the center of the sunspot and rises slowly toward the periphery of the sunspot; this corresponds to the structure of the Evershed flow in the penumbra. The Evershed flow in our model is mainly concentrated in dark penumbral filaments, as is observed.",

This study analyzed sunspot groups and H\u03b1 and X-ray flares reported for the period 1997 - 2007. Annual catalogs were constructed, listing the days that numbered sunspot groups were observed (designated sunspot group-days, SSG-Ds) and for each day a record for each associated H\u03b1 flare of importance category one or greater and normal or bright brightness and for each X-ray flare of intensity C 5 or higher. The catalogs were then analyzed to produce frequency distributions of SSG-Ds by year, sunspot group class, likelihood of producing at least one flare overall and by sunspot group class, and frequency of occurrence of numbers of flares per day and flare intensity category. Only 3% of SSG-Ds produced a substantial H\u03b1 flare and 7% had a significant X-ray flare. We found that mature, complex sunspot groups were more likely than simple sunspot groups to produce a flare, but the latter were more prevalent than the former. More than half of the SSG-Ds with flares had a maximum intensity flare greater than the lowest category (C-class of intensity five and higher). The fact that certain sunspot group classes had flaring probabilities significantly higher than the combined probabilities of the intensity categories when all SSG-Ds were considered suggest that it might be best to first predict the flaring probability. For sunspot groups found likely to flare, a separate diagnosis of maximum flare intensity category appears feasible.",

The approach combines a Fokker-Planck description of short-timescale (daily) fluctuations in sunspot number (Noble and Wheatland, Astrophys. J. 732, 5, 2011) with information from other sources, such as precursor and/or dynamo models. The forecasting is illustrated in application to two historical cycles (cycles 19 and 20), and then to the current solar cycle (cycle 24). The new method allows the prediction of quantiles, i.e. the probability that the sunspot number falls outside large or small bounds at a given future time. It also permits Monte Carlo simulations to identify the expected size and timing of the peak daily sunspot number, as well as the smoothed sunspot number for a cycle. These simulations show how the large variance in daily sunspot number determines the actual reliability of any forecast of the smoothed maximum of a cycle. For cycle 24 we forecast a maximum daily sunspot number of 166\u00b124, to occur in March 2013, and a maximum value of the smoothed sunspot number of 66\u00b15, indicating a very small solar cycle.",

Focusing on these polar regions, we review current understanding of the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere and summarize the outstanding issues. The Juno mission profile involves (a) a several-week approach from the dawn side of Jupiter's magnetosphere, with an orbit-insertion maneuver on July 6, 2016; (b) a 107-day capture orbit, also on the dawn flank; and (c) a series of thirty 11-day science orbits with the spacecraft flying over Jupiter's poles and ducking under the radiation belts. We show how Juno's view of the magnetosphere evolves over the year of science orbits. The Juno spacecraft carries a range of instruments that take particles and fields measurements, remote sensing observations of auroral emissions at UV, visible, IR and radio wavelengths, and detect microwave emission from Jupiter's radiation belts. We summarize how these Juno measurements address issues of auroral processes, microphysical plasma physics, ionosphere-magnetosphere and satellite-magnetosphere coupling, sources and sinks of plasma, the radiation belts, and the dynamics of the outer magnetosphere. To reach Jupiter, the Juno spacecraft passed close to the Earth on October 9, 2013, gaining the necessary energy to get to Jupiter. The Earth flyby provided an opportunity to test Juno's instrumentation as well as take scientific data in the terrestrial magnetosphere, in conjunction with ground-based and Earth-orbiting assets.",

         "abstract": "Almost 40 years ago the concept of the substorm current wedge was developed to explain the magnetic signatures observed on the ground and in geosynchronous orbit during substorm expansion. In the ensuing decades new observations, including radar and low-altitude spacecraft, MHD simulations, and theoretical considerations have tremendously advanced our understanding of this system. The AMPTE/IRM, THEMIS and Cluster missions have added considerable observational knowledge, especially on the important role of fast flows in producing the stresses that generate the substorm current wedge. Recent detailed, multi-spacecraft, multi-instrument observations both in the magnetosphere and in the ionosphere have brought a wealth of new information about the details of the temporal evolution and structure of the current system. While the large-scale picture remains valid, the new details call for revision and an update of the original view. In this paper we briefly review the historical development of the substorm current wedge, review recent in situ and ground-based observations and theoretical work, and discuss the current active research areas. We conclude with a revised, time-dependent picture of the substorm current wedge that follows its evolution from the initial substorm flows through substorm expansion and recovery.",

         "abstract": "This paper summarizes the results obtained by the team \"Heliosheath Processes and the Structure of the Heliopause: Modeling Energetic Particles, Cosmic Rays, and Magnetic Fields\" supported by the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern, Switzerland. We focus on the physical processes occurring in the outer heliosphere, especially at its boundary called the heliopause, and in the local interstellar medium. The importance of magnetic field, charge exchange between neutral atoms and ions, and solar cycle on the heliopause topology and observed heliocentric distances to different heliospheric discontinuities are discussed. It is shown that time-dependent, data-driven boundary conditions are necessary to describe the heliospheric asymmetries detected by the Voyager spacecraft. We also discuss the structure of the heliopause, especially due to its instability and magnetic reconnection. It is demonstrated that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the nose of the heliopause creates consecutive layers of the interstellar and heliospheric plasma which are magnetically connected to different sources. This may be a possible explanation of abrupt changes in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by Voyager 1 when it was crossing the heliopause structure for a period of about one month in the summer of 2012. This paper also discusses the plausibility of fitting simulation results to a number of observational data sets obtained by in situ and remote measurements. The distribution of magnetic field in the vicinity of the heliopause is discussed in the context of Voyager measurements. It is argued that a classical heliospheric current sheet formed due to the Sun's rotation is not observed by in situ measurements and should not be expected to exist in numerical simulations extending to the boundary of the heliosphere. Furthermore, we discuss the transport of energetic particles in the inner and outer heliosheath, concentrating on the anisotropic spatial diffusion diffusion tensor and the pitch-angle dependence of perpendicular diffusion and demonstrate that the latter can explain the observed pitch-angle anisotropies of both the anomalous and galactic cosmic rays in the outer heliosheath.",

         "abstract": "Magnetic turbulence is found in most space plasmas, including the Earth's magnetosphere, and the interaction region between the magnetosphere and the solar wind. Recent spacecraft observations of magnetic turbulence in the ion foreshock, in the magnetosheath, in the polar cusp regions, in the magnetotail, and in the high latitude ionosphere are reviewed. It is found that: 1. A large share of magnetic turbulence in the geospace environment is generated locally, as due for instance to the reflected ion beams in the ion foreshock, to temperature anisotropy in the magnetosheath and the polar cusp regions, to velocity shear in the magnetosheath and magnetotail, and to magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail. 2. Spectral indices close to the Kolmogorov value can be recovered for low frequency turbulence when long enough intervals at relatively constant flow speed are analyzed in the magnetotail, or when fluctuations in the magnetosheath are considered far downstream from the bow shock. 3. For high frequency turbulence, a spectral index \u03b1\u22432.3 or larger is observed in most geospace regions, in agreement with what is observed in the solar wind. 4. More studies are needed to gain an understanding of turbulence dissipation in the geospace environment, also keeping in mind that the strong temperature anisotropies which are observed show that wave particle interactions can be a source of wave emission rather than of turbulence dissipation. 5. Several spacecraft observations show the existence of vortices in the magnetosheath, on the magnetopause, in the magnetotail, and in the ionosphere, so that they may have a primary role in the turbulent injection and evolution. The influence of such a turbulence on the plasma transport, dynamics, and energization will be described, also using the results of numerical simulations.",

         "abstract": "Determining how the heliospheric magnetic field and plasma connect to the Sun's corona and photosphere is, perhaps, the central problem in solar and heliospheric physics. For much of the heliosphere, this connection appears to be well understood. It is now generally accepted that so-called coronal holes, which appear dark in X-rays and are predominantly unipolar at the photosphere, are the sources of quasi-steady wind that is generally fast, &gt;500 km/s, but can sometimes be slow. However, the connection to the Sun of the slow, non-steady wind is far from understood and remains a major mystery. We review the existing theories for the sources of the non-steady wind and demonstrate that they have difficulty accounting for both the observed composition of the wind and its large angular extent. A new theory is described in which this wind originates from the continuous opening and closing of narrow open field corridors in the corona, which give rise to a web of separatrices (the S-Web) in the heliosphere. Note that in this theory the corona\u2014heliosphere connection is intrinsically dynamic, at least for this type of wind. Support for the S-Web model is derived from MHD solutions for the corona and wind during the time of the August 1, 2008 eclipse. Additionally, we perform fully dynamic numerical simulations of the corona and heliosphere in order to test the S-Web model as well as the interchange model proposed by Fisk and co-workers. We discuss the implications of our simulations for the competing theories and for understanding the corona\u2014heliosphere connection, in general.",

         "abstract": "More than half a century after the discovery of Pi2 pulsations, Pi2 research is still vigorous and evolving. Especially in the last decade, new results have provided supporting evidence for some Pi2 models, challenged earlier interpretations, and led to entirely new models. We have gone beyond the inner magnetosphere and have explored the outer magnetosphere, where Pi2 pulsations have been observed in unexpected places. The new Pi2 models cover virtually all magnetotail regions and their coupling, from the reconnection site via the lobes and plasma sheet to the ionosphere. In addition to understanding the Pi2 phenomenon in itself, it has also been important to study Pi2 pulsations in their role as transient manifestations of the coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The transient Pi2 is an integral part of the substorm phenomenon, especially during substorm onset. Key questions about the workings of magnetospheric substorms are still awaiting answers, and research on Pi2 pulsations can help with those answers. Furthermore, the role of Pi2 pulsations in association with other dynamic magnetospheric modes has been explored in the last decade. Thus, the application of Pi2 research has expanded over the years, assuring that Pi2 research will remain active in this decade and beyond. Here we review recent advances, which have given us a new understanding of Pi2 pulsations generated at various places in the magnetosphere during different magnetospheric modes. We review seven Pi2 models found in the literature and show how they are supported by observations from spacecraft and ground observatories as well as numerical simulations. The models have different degrees of maturity; while some enjoy wide acceptance, others are still speculative.",

         "abstract": "Solar thermal tides are planetary-scale waves in the neutral atmosphere with periods that are harmonics of 24 hours. In the thermosphere, they can achieve significant amplitude and can be the dominant source of variation in the atmosphere. Through their modification of the neutral atmosphere, they can also significantly modify the ionosphere, especially at low-latitudes where the dynamics of the Earth's ionosphere is determined to a large extent by the neutral atmosphere. Much recent work has focused on characterizing and understanding the impact of one sub-group of tides, known as non-migrating tides, on the ionosphere. Whereas migrating tides are responsible for creating strong day-night variations in the ionosphere, non-migrating tides create longitudinal variations in the ionosphere, the signature of which can only be detected with distributed networks of ground-based observations or spacecraft. The present work reviews the recent observations and modeling efforts that have helped to characterize and explain this longitudinal variability. Emphasis is placed on the characteristics of tides throughout the thermosphere, their impacts on the chemical composition of the thermosphere, and impacts on the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Auroral substorms are mostly manifestations of dissipative processes of electromagnetic energy. Thus, we consider a sequence of processes consisting of the power supply (dynamo), transmission (currents/circuits) and dissipations (auroral substorms-the end product), namely the electric current line approach. This work confirms quantitatively that after accumulating magnetic energy during the growth phase, the magnetosphere unloads the stored magnetic energy impulsively in order to stabilize itself. This work is based on our result that substorms are caused by two current systems, the directly driven (DD) current system and the unloading system (UL). The most crucial finding in this work is the identification of the UL (unloading) current system which is responsible for the expansion phase. A very tentative sequence of the processes leading to the expansion phase (the generation of the UL current system) is suggested for future discussions. <P />(1) The solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo enhances significantly the plasma sheet current when its power is increased above 10^{18} erg/s (10^{11} w). <P />(2) The magnetosphere accumulates magnetic energy during the growth phase, because the ionosphere cannot dissipate the increasing power because of a low conductivity. As a result, the magnetosphere is inflated, accumulating magnetic energy. <P />(3) When the power reaches 3-5\u00d7 10^{18} erg/s (3-5\u00d7 10^{11} w) for about one hour and the stored magnetic energy reaches 3-5\u00d710^{22} ergs (10^{15} J), the magnetosphere begins to develop perturbations caused by current instabilities (the current density {\u2248}3\u00d7 10^{-12} A/cm<SUP>2</SUP> and the total current {\u2248}10<SUP>6</SUP> A at 6 Re). As a result, the plasma sheet current is reduced. <P />(4) The magnetosphere is thus deflated. The current reduction causes partial B/partial t &gt; 0 in the main body of the magnetosphere, producing an earthward electric field. As it is transmitted to the ionosphere, it becomes equatorward-directed electric field which drives both Pedersen and Hall currents and thus generates the UL current system. <P />(5) A significant part of the magnetic energy is accumulated in the main body of the magnetosphere (the inner plasma sheet) between 4 Re and 10 Re, because the power (Poynting flux [ E \u00d7 B ]) is mainly directed toward this region which can hold the substorm energy. <P />(6) The substorm intensity depends on the location of the energy accumulation (between 4 Re and 10 Re), the closer the location to the earth, the more intense substorms becomes, because the capacity of holding the energy is higher at closer distances. The convective flow toward the earth brings both the ring current and the plasma sheet current closer when the dynamo power becomes higher. <P />This proposed sequence is not necessarily new. Individual processes involved have been considered by many, but the electric current approach can bring them together systematically and provide some new quantitative insights.",

However, a common problem of Orbit Determination processes is the misrepresentation of the Resident Space Object uncertainty through the estimated and predicted covariance. Ultimately, this causes a great impact in the quality and accuracy of Space Surveillance and Tracking products as the covariance is overly optimistic (too small) and the true uncertainty of the object is not properly captured. One of the causes for the unrealism of the covariance is found in the uncertainty of the dynamical and measurement models used to describe the motion of the objects. <P />The aim of this work is to devise a novel methodology to improve the covariance realism of Orbit Determination and Orbit Propagation processes through the classical theory of consider parameters in batch least-squares estimators. The devised methodology uses the theory of consider parameters to add the uncertainty of dynamic and measurement models to the estimated covariance. <P />The magnitude of the consider parameters is weighted using statistical inference techniques, proposing an innovative method to derive its contribution to the covariance. The conceived methodology is suitable for any type of measurement or object, although its primary goal is to correct unrealistic covariance of non-cooperative targets. <P />Among the wide variety of uncertainty sources affecting covariance realism, the influence and effect of two relevant modelling uncertainties, the atmospheric drag force and the range bias, is discussed during this publication. The proposed methodology is first applied to a simulated scenario of tracking measurements, using a Monte Carlo approach. A case involving real radar observations is presented as well, where the uncertainty realism of the Sentinel-3A orbit determination and propagation is assessed and improved. Using the novel methodology of Covariance Determination, covariance realism improvement of a real tracking campaign is achieved and the uncertainty of the atmospheric drag force model quantified.",

In this paper, we present efficiency of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in ionosphere time series prediction at severe solar activity periods. The high accuracy prediction of the ionosphere total electron content (TEC) using ANFIS is the main purpose of the paper. Also, investigation of the daily, monthly and annually temporal behavior of the ionosphere is another goal of the paper. Three GPS stations (ANKR, ANTL and ZONG) from Turkish permanent GPS network (TPGN) are selected for analysis. These stations are at mid-latitudes. To predict and analyze ionospheric temporal behavior, observations of the 2014-2015 are selected. The index of solar activity in these 2 years is the maximum. Training of ANFIS is done by back-propagation (BP) algorithm. In order to analyze the accuracy of the proposed method, testing step has been performed in different days, months and seasons and compared with the global ionosphere map (GIM) TEC as a traditional ionosphere model, as well as, international reference ionosphere 2016 (IRI2016) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. To validate the results, root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, relative error, dTEC = |TEC<SUB>GPS</SUB>-TEC<SUB>MODEL</SUB>| and residual histogram are used. At testing step, the maximum correlation coefficient obtained 0.869 for the ANFIS. Also, the minimum RMSE of 3.131 TECU is computed for ANFIS at testing step. Using the ANFIS model, the daily, monthly and annual variations of the ionosphere time series are revealed with high accuracy. The results show that the ANFIS model is a reliable and high-precision alternative to the conventional ionosphere models in Turkish region.",

         "abstract": "A key objective of space situational awareness is to provide an accurate characterization of state uncertainty of space objects (SOs) in order to support predictive analytics, such as assessments of the probability of collision with other SOs. Due to a large number of SOs in comparison with the limited number of sensors available for tracking them, physics based uncertainty forecasting is often required for long periods, during which state uncertainty can become highly non-Gaussian. In this paper, we consider the problem of uncertainty forecasting in perturbed two-body dynamics via adaptive Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). While widely used, the standard Monte Carlo approach is limited by two main challenges: i.) its slow rate of convergence, which is especially detrimental to its application in complex systems where each simulation is computationally expensive; and ii.) ambiguity in the ensemble's capability to \"accurately\" characterize the true state-pdf over time with a fixed ensemble size, given the fact that the propagated state uncertainty is time-varying and unknown in advance. We employ a newly developed adaptive Monte Carlo method that aims to characterize the propagated state-pdf within user defined accuracy bounds in the perturbed two-body dynamics. In the adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm, the transient performance of MCS is quantified in terms of the standard deviation of its approximation error, which is estimated via bootstrapping. A particle addition scheme is activated when the approximation error exceeds the user-defined upper bound at the current time and new particles are introduced sequentially, one at a time. These are selected through a two-layered algorithm that (a.) enforces optimal inter-particle projective distance, and (b.) minimizes sample discrepancy with respect to the true initial state-pdf in terms of the space-filling and non-collapsing properties. On the other hand, particles are removed (halted) for future propagation when current MCS error is estimated to be lower than the user defined threshold, in the interest of reducing computational load. Particle removal is dependent on their own evolved probability-density values which are obtained by solving the corresponding stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) numerically. As a result, the proposed approach is expected to generate a \"minimal\" ensemble of particles to characterize the propagated state-pdf within user defined accuracy bounds at all future times. Numerical simulations are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting method.",

Analysis of the 89 validated ozone profiles shows the variation of ozone concentration in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) caused by cut-off lows (COLs) over Changchun. During the COL events, an increase of the ozone concentration and a lower height of the tropopause are observed. Backward simulations with a trajectory model show that the ozone-rich airmass brought by the COL is from Siberia. A case study proves that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) occurs in the COL. The ozone-rich air mass transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere first becomes unstable, then loses its high ozone concentration. This process usually happens during the decay stage of COLs. In order to understand the influence of COLs on the ozone in the UTLS, statistical analysis of the ozone profiles within COLs, and other profiles, are employed. The results indicate that the ozone concentrations of the in-COL profiles are significantly higher than those of the other profiles between \u00b14 km around the tropopause. The COLs induce an increase in UTLS column ozone by 32% on average. Meanwhile, the COLs depress the lapse-rate tropopause (LRT)/dynamical tropopause height by 1.4/1.7 km and cause the atmosphere above the tropopause to be less stable. The influence of COLs is durable because the increased ozone concentration lasts at least one day after the COL has passed over Changchun. Furthermore, the relative coefficient between LRT height and lower stratosphere (LS) column ozone is -0.62, which implies a positive correlation between COL strength and LS ozone concentration.",

         "abstract": "This paper examines the dominant submonthly variability of zonally symmetrical atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter within the context of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), with particular emphasis on interactive stratosphere-troposphere processes. The submonthly variability is identified and measured using a daily NAM index, which concentrates primarily on zonally symmetrical circulation. A schematic lifecycle of submonthly variability is developed that reveals a two-way coupling process between the stratosphere and troposphere in the NH polar region. Specifically, anomalous tropospheric zonal winds in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Arctic propagate upwards to the low stratosphere, disturbing the polar vortex, and resulting in an anomalous stratospheric geopotential height (HGT) that subsequently propagates down into the troposphere and changes the sign of the surface circulations. From the standpoint of planetary-scale wave activities, a feedback loop is also evident when the anomalous planetary-scale waves (with wavenumbers 2 and 3) propagate upwards, which disturbs the anomalous zonally symmetrical flow in the low stratosphere, and induces the anomalous HGT to move poleward in the low stratosphere, and then propagates down into the troposphere. This increases the energy of waves at wavenumbers 2 and 3 in the low troposphere in middle latitudes by enhancing the land-sea contrast of the anomalous HGT field. Thus, this study supports the viewpoint that the downward propagation of stratospheric NAM signals may not originate in the stratosphere.",

S-type AO events showed a stratosphere-troposphere coupled structure, while T-type events exhibited a stratosphere-troposphere uncoupled structure. The annular SAT anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere were found to be associated with S-type AO events, whereas such an annular feature was substantially destructed in T-type AO events. The different horizontal structures in the troposphere of the two types could mainly be attributed to transient eddy feedback forcing. As for the vertically uncoupled structure of Ttype events, the underlying dynamical features that differentiate them from S-type events lie in the vertical propagation of zonally confined Rossby waves. In T-type events, the zonally confined Rossby wave packets can emanate from the significant height anomalies over Northeast Asia, where one vertical waveguide exists, and then propagate upward into the stratosphere. In contrast, such a vertical propagation was not evident for S-type events. The stratospheric anomalies associated with the upward injection of the zonally confined Rossby waves from the troposphere in T-type events can further induce the anomalous vertical propagation of planetary waves (PWs) through the interference between the climatological-mean PWs and anomalous PWs, leading to the final stratosphere-troposphere uncoupled structure of T-type events.",

Then, a sensitivity experiment, with the methane volume mixing ratio increased by 10%, was carried out to study the influence of an increase of methane on air temperature. The results showed that methane has a heating effect through the infrared radiative process in the troposphere and a cooling effect in the stratosphere. However, the cooling effect of the methane is much smaller than that of water vapor in the stratosphere and is negligible in the mesosphere. The simulation results also showed that when methane concentration is increased by 10%, the air temperature lowers in the stratosphere and mesosphere and increases in the troposphere. The cooling can reach 0.2 K at the stratopause and can vary from 0.2-0.4 K in the mesosphere, and the temperature rise varies by around 0.001-0.002 K in the troposphere. The cooling results from the increase of the infrared radiative cooling rate caused by increased water vapor and O<SUB>3</SUB> concentration, which are stimulated by the increase in methane in most of the stratosphere. The infrared radiation cooling of methane itself is minor. The depletion of O<SUB>3</SUB> stimulated by the methane increase results indirectly in a decrease in the rate of solar radiation heating, producing cooling in the stratopause and mesosphere. The tropospheric warming is mainly caused by the increase of methane, which produces infrared radiative heating. The increase in H<SUB>2</SUB>O and O<SUB>3</SUB> caused by the methane increase also contributes to a rise in temperature in the troposphere.",

The maximum residence time was \u223c20 days, especially within the Asian high anticyclone consistent with its confinement effects. In general, the overall geographical distribution of dehydration points was not coincident with the location of tropopause crossing. TST trajectories, which were initialized in the stratosphere, underwent their Lagrangian cold points mostly in the tropics and subtropics 1-4 days after the TST event; they were characterized by a wide range of temperature differences, with a mean value of 3-12 K. The vertical extent of the influence of tropospheric intrusion on the Asian monsoon region in the stratosphere exhibited a peak at \u223c16.5-18.5 km, and the uppermost height was \u223c21 km.",

         "abstract": "The heating of the chromosphere is a long-lived puzzle in modern astronomy. Solar synoptic maps of He I 10830 \u00c5 intensity, which are observed at National Solar Observatory/Kitt Peak from Jul. 2005 to Mar. 2013 are utilized to investigate the phase relation of long-term evolution of the quiet chromosphere represented by He I intensity with the solar cycle represented by sunspot number. The phase relationship of the He I chromosphere at low and middle latitudes with the solar cycle is found to show an interesting phenomenon, black under the light: (1) at most of the latitudes of the conspicuous active chromosphere (the butterfly diagram), the relationship is anti-phase, but at the latitudes outside the butterfly diagram (the inconspicuous background chromosphere), it is in-phase; and (2) the He I intensity averaged over the low latitudes of 0- 30 \u00b0 is in anti-phase with the solar cycle, but after deducing some relatively small values of He I intensity, the anti-phase relationship is reversed to be in-phase. Long-term variation of He I intensity at the full disk of the quiet chromosphere is believed to be in phase with the solar cycle, and accordingly, the temporal evolution of the heated quiet chromosphere is in phase with long-term variation of the small-scale magnetic elements whose flux is (2.9 - 32.0) \u00d710<SUP>18</SUP> Mx, and it provides evidence for the heating of the quiet chromosphere mainly by the magnetic elements. Implication of the findings is discussed, and especially, the long-term variation of total solar irradiance measured at low latitudes is inferred to be significantly different from that at high latitudes.",

         "abstract": "The high variability of the Sun's magnetic field is responsible for the generation of perturbations that propagate throughout the heliosphere. Such disturbances often drive interplanetary shocks in front of their leading regions. Strong shocks transfer momentum and energy into the solar wind ahead of them which in turn enhance the solar wind interaction with magnetic fields in its way. Shocks then eventually strike the Earth's magnetosphere and trigger a myriad of geomagnetic effects observed not only by spacecraft in space, but also by magnetometers on the ground. Recently, it has been revealed that shocks can show different geoeffectiveness depending closely on the angle of impact. Generally, frontal shocks are more geoeffective than inclined shocks, even if the former are comparatively weaker than the latter. This review is focused on results obtained from modeling and experimental efforts in the last 15 years. Some theoretical and observational background are also provided. <P />&lt;/ce:displayed-quote&gt;The possibility of the existence of shocks in the interplanetary space was then accepted. Parker (1961) suggested a model for shock propagation in the interplanetary space. His idea was further extended by Hundhausen and Gentry (1969). However, the first evidences of collisionless shocks in nature were observed in the interplanetary space. As seen above, the existence of the magnetosphere suggested the formation of a stationary collisionless shock at the front of the magnetosphere. Curiously, the existence of a stationary shock, i.e., a shock at rest in the Earth's reference frame, was suggested in the same edition of the Journal of Geophysical Research by Axford (1962) and Kellogg (1962). The bow shock was first observed by the Mariner 2 spacecraft as irreversible changes in the solar wind and IMF which were interpreted as hydromagnetic shocks (Ness et al., 1964; Sonett et al., 1964). The bow shock is formed if a supersonic flow interacts with an obstacle, and it separates the pristine solar wind from the subsonic plasma flow in the magnetosheath. Another magnetospheric boundary is the magnetopause, a current layer whose position is determined by the pressure balance condition between the solar wind dynamic pressure and the magnetospheric magnetic pressure, first observed by Heppner et al. (1963) and Cahill and Amazeen (1963). The region between the bow shock and the magnetopause is called the magnetosheath. The magnetosheath in the subsolar region for typical solar wind conditions is located approximately at a distance between 10R<SUB>E</SUB> and 13R<SUB>E</SUB> (Earth radius of \u223c 6400 km) from the Earth (Cahill and Amazeen, 1963; Heppner et al., 1963; Russell, 1984). This region is highly turbulent because it is formed by the shocked solar wind (Russell, 1984; Paschmann, 2005). The bow shock, magnetopause, and magnetosheath are shown in Fig. 2, as seen in Eastwood et al. (2014). The numerical gas dynamic model of Spreiter et al. (1966) reasonably well predicted the bow shock formation and magnetosheath flow between the bow shock and magnetopause obstacle. For a broader perspective on the discovery of the magnetosphere, see, e.g., Russell (1984) and Gillmor and Spreiter (1997).&lt;/ce:para&gt;",

We focus on the role of planetary and gravity waves in driving the middle atmosphere circulation and illustrate the stratosphere-mesosphere coupling during undisturbed wintertime circulation, during an SSW event, and after an SSW event during the formation of an elevated stratopause using simulations of past Arctic and Antarctic winters from the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). We illustrate the transition of the polar stratopause from being a gravity wave driven phenomena to a planetary wave driven phenomena during SSW events and its subsequent reestablishment and control by gravity waves. We also examine the synoptic structure of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere using SD-WACCM data fields that show the structure of the vortex during specific dynamical events in both hemispheres. We illustrate the longitudinal asymmetry in the thermal structure in the stratosphere and mesosphere driven by differences in circulation over the polar cap regions during an SSW event. We complement this analysis of the middle atmosphere circulation with a classification of both the Arctic and Antarctic winters since 1979 into major, minor, elevated stratopause or quiet winters based on the level of disturbance using the Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis data. From the MERRA data we find that the combined occurrences of both major and minor warmings in the Arctic have remained constant over the past three decades while we find a minor increase in their occurrences in the Antarctic.",

         "abstract": "Global Positioning System (GPS) is a remote sensing tool of space weather and ionospheric variations. However, the interplanetary space-dependent drifts in the ionospheric irregularities cause predominant ranging errors in the GPS signals. The dynamic variability of the low-latitude ionosphere is an imperative threat to the satellite-based radio communication and navigation ranging systems. The study of temporal and spatial variations in the ionosphere has triggered new investigations in modelling, nowcasting and forecasting the ionospheric variations. Hence, in this paper, the dynamism in the day-to-day, month-to-month and seasonal variability of the ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) has been explored during the solar maximum period, January-December 2013, of the 24th solar cycle. The spatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere are analysed using the TEC values derived from three Indian low-latitude GPS stations, namely, Bengaluru, Guntur and Hyderabad, separated by 13-18\u00b0 in latitude and 77-81\u00b0 in longitude. The observed regional GPS-TEC variations are compared with the predicted TEC values of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2012 and 2007) models. Ionospheric parameters such as Vertical TEC (VTEC), relative TEC deviation index and monthly variations in the grand-mean of ionosphere TEC and TEC intensity, along with the upper and lower quartiles, are adopted to investigate the ionosphere TEC variability during quiet and disturbed days. The maximum ionospheric TEC variability is found during March and September equinoxes, followed by December solstice while the minimum variability is observed during June solstice. IRI models are in reasonable agreement with GPS TEC but are overestimating during dawn hours (01:00-06:00 LT) as compared to the dusk hours. Higher percentage deviations are observed during equinoctial months than summer over EIA stations, Guntur and Hyderabad. GPS TEC variations are overestimated during dawn hours for all the seasons over Bengaluru. It has also been observed that positive storm effect (enhancement of TEC) is observed during the main phase of the March storm, 2013 (March 16-18, 2013) while both positive and negative storm effects (depletion of TEC) are registered during the main phase of the June storm, 2013 (June 28-30, 2013) at Bengaluru and Guntur, respectively. IRI-2012 model has slightly large discrepancies with the GPS-VTEC compared with the IRI-2007 model during the June storm, 2013 over Guntur station. This analysis highlights the importance of upgrading the IRI models due to their discrepancies during quiet and disturbed states of the ionosphere and developing an early warning forecast system to alert about ionosphere variability.",

         "abstract": "Observations made with the two Voyager spacecraft confirmed that the solar wind decelerates to form the heliospheric termination shock. Voyager 1 crossed this termination shock at \u223c94 AU in 2004, while Voyager 2 crossed it in 2007 at a different heliolatitude, about 10 AU closer to the Sun. These different positions of the termination shock confirm the dynamic and cyclic nature of the shock's position. Observations from the two Voyager spacecraft inside the heliosheath indicate significant differences between them, suggesting that apart from the dynamic nature caused by changing solar activity there also may exist a global asymmetry in the north-south (polar) dimensions of the heliosphere, in addition to the expected nose-tail asymmetry. This relates to the direction in which the heliosphere is moving in interstellar space and its orientation with respect to the interstellar magnetic field. In this paper we focus on illustrating the effects of this north-south asymmetry on modulation of galactic cosmic ray Carbon, between polar angles of 55\u00b0 and 125\u00b0, using a numerical model which includes all four major modulation processes, the termination shock and the heliosheath. This asymmetry is incorporated in the model by assuming a significant dependence on heliolatitude of the thickness of the heliosheath. When comparing the computed spectra between the two polar angles, we find that at energies E &lt; \u223c1.0 GeV the effects of the assumed asymmetry on the modulated spectra are insignificant up to 60 AU from the Sun but become increasingly more significant with larger radial distances to reach a maximum inside the heliosheath. In contrast, with E &gt; \u223c1.0 GeV, these effects remain insignificant throughout the heliosphere even very close to the heliopause. Furthermore, we find that a higher local interstellar spectrum for Carbon enhances the effects of asymmetric modulation between the two polar angles at lower energies ( E &lt; \u223c300 MeV). In conclusion, it is found that north-south asymmetrical effects on the modulation of cosmic ray Carbon depend strongly on the extent of the geometrical asymmetry of the heliosheath together with the assumed value of the local interstellar spectrum.",

         "abstract": "We present the method of automatic forecasting of the impacts of Solar Cosmic Ray (SCR)/Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) and estimation of radiation hazard level. We use the model of SCR/SEP diffusion in general form and coupling functions for neutron monitors of worldwide network with different altitudes and cutoff rigidities, including space detectors such as GOES-11,12. Another observational data for the estimation of energy spectra of SCR/SEP are measurements of different neutron multiplicities by some neutron monitors (e.g., for great SCR/SEP event held in September 29, 1989). A 1-min data of muon telescopes and ionization chambers shielded by 10-cm PB are used for the detection of the highest-energy SCR/SEP components (e.g., for SCR/SEP events held on February 23, 1956; Dorman, 1957). We demonstrate algorithms to automatically estimate event starting times, determine the time evolution of SCR/SEP in space using coupling functions in the frame of spectrographic method, solve inverse problems associated with SCR/SEP generation in solar corona and propagation in the interplanetary space, automatically determine escaping into solar wind and propagation in space based on the CR observation data parameters of SCR/SEP generation and propagation in solar corona. Based on these parameters, we show that it is possible to automatically forecast the first 0.5 h data on expected level of radiation hazards from a full-time event (up to about 48 h) for objects in space on different distances from the Sun, in magnetosphere at different orbits, and in atmosphere at different altitudes and cutoff rigidities. It is important, before the start of the automatic forecasting procedure, to calculate the expected level of radiation hazards for full time of event by determining every 5-10 min recalculated forecasting fluxes of SCR/SEP in space, out of magnetosphere, back to the CR ground detectors, and detectors on satellites using the same coupling functions. If the difference between the obtained results and observed data is smaller or no statistical errors, it is possible to provide effective forecasting automatically and subsequently calculate the expected level of radiation hazards. If the expected level of radiation hazards is high in certain objects, after about 0.5 h from the event starting time, it will be formatted and a corresponding alert is sent. The same alerts will be repeated with time for different objects in space, in magnetosphere, and in atmosphere. Based on the first 0.5 h data from event beginning, the radiation hazard level from high-energy particles such as SCR/SEP is considered to be low (with very small flux). If with increasing time the radiation hazard level rises with energy \u22641 GeV, it is formatted. Also, at the beginning of some SCR/SEP events when the Earth is on or near the force line of IMF connected with the source of SCR/SEP, several CR stations with direct arriving along the magnetic force line with about no scattering SCR/SEP particles on magnetic inhomogeneities will show strong narrow pulse with no information on SCR/SEP diffusion during the propagation from the source to the detector. These CR stations at the beginning of the SCR/SEP event can be used only for estimating SCR/SEP energy spectrum in the source and at the time of injection into solar wind but not on diffusion. Hence, it is necessary to automatically separate the CR stations with strong narrow pulses and exclude them from diffusion analysis. We strive to make this automatic using a program of image identification in the frame of MATLAB.",

A full three-dimensional numerical model based on Parker's transport equation is used to study the modulation of 10 MeV galactic electrons, in particular inside the heliosheath. The emphasis is placed on the role that perpendicular diffusion plays in causing the extraordinary large increase in the observed intensities of these electrons in the heliosheath. The modelling is compared with observations of 6-14 MeV electrons from the Voyager 1 mission. Results are shown for the radial intensity profiles of these electrons, as well as the modulation effects of varying the extent of the heliosheath by changing the location of the termination shock and the heliopause and the value of the local interstellar spectrum. We confirm that the heliosheath acts as a modulation 'barrier' for low-energy galactic electrons. The significance of this result depends on how wide the inner heliosheath is; on how high the very local interstellar spectrum is at these low energies (E &lt; 100 MeV) and on how small perpendicular diffusion is inside the inner heliosheath.",

         "abstract": "Observations made with the two Voyager spacecraft confirmed that the solar wind decelerates to form the heliospheric termination shock and that it has begun its merger with the local interstellar medium. The compression ratio of this shock affects galactic cosmic rays when they enter the heliosphere. Hydrodynamic (HD) models show that the compression ratio can have a significant latitude dependence; with the largest value in the nose direction of the heliosphere, becoming significantly less towards the polar regions. The modulation effects of such large latitude dependence are studied, using a well-established numerical drift and shock modulation model. We focus on computing the modulated spectra for galactic protons with emphasis on the radial and polar gradients in the equatorial plane and at a polar angle of \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, corresponding to the heliolatitude of Voyager 1. Two sets of solutions are computed and compared each time; with and without a latitude dependence for the compression ratio. All computations are done for the two magnetic field polarity cycles assuming solar minimum conditions. Including the termination shock in the model allows the study of the re-acceleration of galactic protons in the outer heliosphere. We find that for the A &lt; 0 polarity cycle the intensity between \u223c200 MeV and \u223c1 GeV in the vicinity of the shock in the heliospheric equatorial plane may exceed the local interstellar value specified at the heliopause. Unfortunately, at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, the effect is reduced. This seems not possible during an A &gt; 0 cycle because significant modulation is then predicted between the heliopause and the termination shock, depending on how strong global gradient and curvature drifts are in the heliosheath. The overall effect of the shock on galactic protons in the equatorial plane is to reduce the total modulation as a function of radial distance with respect to the interstellar spectrum. Making the compression ratio latitude dependent enhances these effects at energies E &lt; 200 MeV in the equatorial plane. At larger heliolatitudes these effects are even more significant. The differences in the modulation between the two drift cycles are compelling when the compression ratio is made latitude dependent but at Earth this effect is insignificant. A general result is that the computed radial gradient changes for galactic protons at and close to the TS and that these changes are polarity dependent. In line with previous work, large polarity dependent effects are predicted for the inner heliosphere and also close to the shock\u2019s position in the equatorial plane. In contrast, at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, the largest polarity effect occurs in the middle heliosphere (50 AU), enhanced by the latitude dependence of the compression ratio. At this latitude, the amount of proton modulation between the heliopause and the termination shock is much reduced. If galactic cosmic rays were to experience some diffusive shock acceleration over the 100-1000 MeV range at the shock, the radial gradient should change its sign in the vicinity of the shock, how large, depends on the compression ratio and the amount of drifts taking place in the outer heliosphere. The effective polar gradient shows a strong polarity dependence at Earth but this dissipates at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, especially with increasing radial distance. This tendency is enhanced by making the compression ratio latitude dependent.",

         "abstract": "Substorm onset timing is a critical issue in magnetotail dynamics research. Solar wind energy is accumulated in the magnetosphere and the configuration of the magnetosphere evolves toward an unstable state during the growth phase. At some point, the expansion phase begins and the stored energy is released through a variety of processes that return the magnetosphere to a lower energy state. In recovery the various processes die away. Unfortunately, the ground and magnetospheric signatures of onset, i.e. energy release, can be seen both in the growth phase prior to onset and in the expansion phase after onset. Some investigators refer to each of these events as a substorm. Tail observations suggest that most substorms have one event that differentiates the behavior of the tail field and plasma. We refer to this time as the \"main substorm onset\". Each substorm associated phenomenon is timed independently and then compared with main substorm onsets. ISEE-2 tail observations are used to examine the tail lobe magnetic conditions associated with substorms because ISEE-2 orbit has a high inclination and frequently observes lobe field. Approximately 70 \u223c 75% of tail lobe B<SUB>t</SUB> and B<SUB>z</SUB> change are associated with the main substorm onset. If the satellite is more than 3 Re above (below) the neutral sheet, 86% (57%) of plasma pressure dropouts are associated with substorms. We interpret our results as evidence that the effect of the growth phase is to drive the magnetosphere towards instability. As it approaches global instability local regions become temporarily unstable but are rapidly quenched. Eventually one of these events develops into the global instability that releases most of the stored energy and returns the magnetosphere to a more stable configuration.",

         "abstract": "Recently, Javaraiah (2012a) analyzed the combined Greenwich and Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) sunspot group data during the period 1874-2011 and studied variations in the annual numbers (counts) of the small (maximum area A&lt;100 millionth of solar hemisphere, msh), large (100\u2a7dA&lt;300msh), and big (A\u2a7e300msh) sunspot groups. Here that analysis is extended and studied variations in the mean maximum sizes (the mean values of maximum areas) of the aforementioned three classes of sunspot groups and also their combination. It is found that there is no significant correlation between the mean maximum size of any class of sunspot groups and the International Sunspot Number (R), probably due to in a given time interval small sunspot groups/sunspots outnumber the large ones. A pattern of an approximate 9-year period cycle is seen in the variations of the mean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups during a solar cycle. On long-time scales it is found that there exists a strong 130 or more years cycle in the variation of the mean size of the small sunspot groups, whereas there is a hint on the existence of \u224844-year cycles in the variations of the mean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups. During the decline phase of cycle 23, there was a scarcity in the sunspot groups whose A\u2a7d37msh, which may be related to the slow growth of sunspot groups during this period. During the minimum between cycles 23 and 24 may be due to the presence of a number of small sunspot groups whose A&gt;37 was larger than that of whose A\u2a7d37, the relatively large size coronal holes were present at low-latitudes and the total solar irradiance was very low.",

         "abstract": "Observations of galactic Carbon in the heliosphere provide a useful tool with which a comprehensive description of the global modulation of cosmic rays both inside and outside off the solar wind termination shock (TS) can be made. This is, in part, because galactic Carbon is not contaminated by anomalous cosmic rays as is the case for oxygen, helium and hydrogen. However, this kind of study requires that there should be reasonable compatibility of model solutions to spacecraft and earthbound observations. In this study, the well-established two-dimensional model that contains a TS, a heliosheath, as well as shock re-acceleration of galactic cosmic rays and particle drifts, is used first to study modulation from solar minimum to moderate maximum activity at Earth. This model can handle any global heliospheric geometry of both the TS and heliopause (HP) positions. Second, the model is applied to study the contribution of drifts and the enhancement of polar perpendicular diffusion in the heliosheath to the total modulation in the heliosphere as a function of energy for both polarity cycles of the magnetic field during solar minimum conditions. This modeling is done with a new heliopause spectrum (HPS, usually referred to as the local interstellar spectrum) at kinetic energy E &lt; \u223c200 MeV/nuc. This HPS is derived from observations made by the Voyager 1 spacecraft of galactic Carbon at a radial distance of \u223c122 AU from the Sun. We find that: (1) The model gives realistic modulation for both magnetic polarity cycles of the Sun, from Earth to beyond the TS, and that the level of modulation at Earth between the recent solar minimum and the previous moderate maximum condition exceed that between the HP and Earth in the recent solar minimum. (2) Neglecting drifts in the heliosheath along the Voyager heliolatitude is a reasonable assumption, but in the equatorial plane of the heliosphere drifts are important for heliosheath modulation in the A &lt; 0 polarity cycle, especially when galactic particles are re-accelerated at the TS. (3) The contribution of the enhancement of the polar perpendicular diffusion in the heliosheath to the total modulation seems insignificant. (4) The new HPS as observed by Voyager 1 at E &lt; \u223c200 MeV/nuc is found to be significantly higher than previous estimates, for example, at E = 100 MeV/nuc by a factor of \u223c2. We find that the total modulation between the HP and Earth at 10 MeV/nuc causes the intensity at Earth to be only \u223c4.5% of the HPS, whereas for 100 MeV/nuc it is \u223c17.5%. Respectively, this means that the global radial gradient for galactic Carbon for this period was \u223c2.5%/AU and \u223c1.4%/AU, if the heliopause is taken at 122 AU.",

In low Earth Orbits (LEO) neutral atmospheric density uncertainty is the main contributor to orbital state vector uncertainty. Grid-scale model uncertainty on the other hand is, in most cases, the dominating component of atmospheric density uncertainty. <P />Prior research in the field of density uncertainty has been broad. Nowadays multiple authors seem to agree that a first-order stochastic Gauss-Markov process, also known as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP), is an appropriate stochastic representation for density model uncertainties. While many have studied orbital variations due to stochastic grid-scale density uncertainty, it is believed that the work at hand provides for the first time explicit analytic equations for the estimation of orbital uncertainties due to an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that has been optimized for the representation of atmospheric density. It is shown that the long-term in-track position error due to this modified OUP grows with t<SUP>3</SUP> . <P />The presented derivations and their validation build upon prior work by Emmert et al. and Sagni\u00e8res and Sharf. Numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to validate the findings with two different semi-empirical density models.

         "abstract": "We examined performance of two empirical profile-based ionospheric models, namely IRI-2016 and NeQuick-2, in electron content (EC) and total electron content (TEC) representation for different seasons and levels of solar activity. We derived and analyzed EC estimates in several representative altitudinal intervals for the ionosphere and the plasmasphere from the COSMIC GPS radio occultation, ground-based GPS and Jason-2 joint altimeter/GPS observations. It allows us to estimate a quantitative impact of the ionospheric electron density profiles formulation in several altitudinal intervals and to examine the source of the model-data discrepancies of the EC specification from the bottom-side ionosphere towards the GPS orbit altitudes. The most pronounced model-data differences were found at the low latitude region as related to the equatorial ionization anomaly appearance. Both the IRI-2016 and NeQuick-2 models tend to overestimate the daytime ionospheric EC and TEC at low latitudes during all seasons of low solar activity. On the contrary, during high solar activity the model results underestimated the EC/TEC observations at low latitudes. We found that both models underestimated the EC for the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere regions for all levels of solar activity. For low solar activity, the underestimated EC from the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere can compensate the overestimation of the ionospheric EC and, consequently, can slightly decrease the resulted model overestimation of the ground-based TEC. For high solar activity, the underestimated EC from the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere leads to a strengthening of the model underestimation of the ground-based TEC values. We demonstrated that the major source of the model-data discrepancies in the EC/TEC domain comes from the topside ionosphere/plasmasphere system.",

         "abstract": "Observations of unusually large magnetic fields in the ionosphere indicate periods of maximum stress on Titan's ionosphere and potentially of the strongest loss rates of ionospheric plasma. During Titan flyby T42, the observed magnetic field attained a maximum value of 37 nT between an altitude of 1200 and 1600 km, about 20 nT stronger than on any other Titan pass and close to five times greater in magnetic pressure. The strong fields occurred near the corotation-flow terminator rather than at the sub-flow point, suggesting that the flow which magnetized the ionosphere was from a direction far from corotation and possibly towards Saturn. Extrapolation of solar wind plasma conditions from Earth to Saturn using the University of Michigan MHD code predicts an enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure at Saturn close to this time. Cassini's earlier exits from Saturn's magnetosphere support this prediction because the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer instrument saw a magnetopause crossing three hours before the strong field observation. Thus it appears that Titan's ionosphere was magnetized when the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure compressed the Saturnian magnetosphere, and perhaps the magnetosheath magnetic field, against Titan. The solar wind pressure then decreased, leaving a strong fossil field in the ionosphere. When observed, this strong magnetic flux tube had begun to twist, further enhancing its strength.",

In the previous paper (Morozova et al., 2017) we mainly discussed the first mode of principal component analysis of tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature and pressure fields, which was shown to be correlated with lower stratospheric ozone and anti-correlated with cosmic ray flux. Now we extend the investigation to the second mode, which suggests a coupling between the stratosphere and the ionosphere. <P />This second mode, located in the low and middle stratosphere (and explaining ~7% of temperature and ~3% of geopotential height variations), showed to be statistically significantly correlated with variations of the middle stratosphere ozone content and anti-correlated with variations of ionospheric total electron content. Similar co-variability of these stratospheric and ionospheric parameters was also obtained with the wavelet cross-coherence analysis. <P />To investigate the role of atmospheric circulation dynamics and the causal nature of the found correlations, we applied the convergent cross mapping (CCM) analysis to our series. Strong evidence for the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling were obtained for the winter 2012-2013 that is characterized by the easterly QBO phase (quasi-biennial oscillations of the direction of the stratospheric zonal winds) and a strong SSW (sudden stratospheric warming event). Further analysis (for the three-year time interval 2012-2015) hint that SSWs events play main role in emphasizing the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

         "abstract": "Periodicity in occurrence of magnetic disturbances in polar cap and auroral zone under conditions of steady and powerful solar wind influence on the magnetosphere is analyzed on the example of 9 storm events with distinctly expressed sawtooth substorms (N = 48). Relationships between the polar cap magnetic activity (PC-index), magnetic disturbances in the auroral zone (AL-index) and value of the ring current asymmetry (ASYM index) were examined within the intervals of the PC growth phase and the PC decline phase inherent to each substorm. It is shown that the substorm sudden onsets are always preceded by the PC growth and that the substorm development does not affect the PC growth rate. On achieving the disturbance maximum, the PC and AL indices are simultaneously fall down to the level preceding the substorm, so that the higher the substorm intensity, the larger is the AL and PC drop in the decline phase. The ASYM index increases and decreases in conformity with the PC and AL behavior, the correlation between ASYM and PC being better than between ASYM and AL. Level of the solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere determines periodicity and intensity of disturbances: the higher the coupling function E<SUB>KL</SUB>, the higher is substorm intensity and shorter is substorm length. Taking into account the permanently high level of auroral activity and inconsistency of aurora behavior and magnetic onsets during sawtooth substorms, the conclusion is made that auroral ionosphere conductivity is typically high and ensures an extremely high intensity of field-aligned currents in R1 FAC system. The periodicity of sawtooth substorms is determined by recurrent depletions and restorations of R1 currents, which are responsible for coordinated variations of magnetic activity in the polar cap and auroral zone.",

Long propagation times may result in the need to use filtering algorithms for orbit determination that do not reside to the assumption of Gaussianity for state errors but estimate the entire probability density function. Adaptive Gaussian mixture based filters have shown promising results in the past. Previous research in the field of orbit determination using Gaussian mixture filters has restricted its attention to initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction. The present paper focuses on the consequences of including realistic, physics-based descriptions of atmospheric density uncertainty into the covariance propagation of the mixture kernels. <P />It is shown that the neglect of process noise, as has been customary for many years, can lead to undesired characteristics of the probability density function (pdf) estimates and that the inclusion of atmospheric density uncertainty process noise, even in cases where it is not the dominant driver of along-track uncertainty growth, is able to correct these deficiencies. For low orbiting satellites with increased ballistic coefficients or small initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction, density uncertainty is the dominant driver of the along-track uncertainty increase. Due to its growth that evolves at least cubic in time, situations may arise which require the usage of Gaussian mixtures also for the process noise when working in Cartesian coordinates. The theoretical foundation for this case is elaborated and an algorithm capable of dynamically switching between a single Gaussian and a Gaussian mixture for the density uncertainty process noise is presented.",

For this purpose, the obtained EPB longitudinal patterns were compared with the thermosphere and ionosphere characteristics having the prominent \"wave-like\" longitudinal structures with wave number 4, which are uniquely associated with the influence of the troposphere DE3 tides. The characteristics of the equatorial mass density anomaly (EMA), equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA), zonal wind and pre-reversal E \u00d7 B drift enhancement (PRE) were used for comparison. The equinox seasons during high solar activity were under consideration. It was obtained that the longitudinal patterns of the EMA and zonal wind show the surprising similarity with the EPB distributions (R \u2245 0.8, R \u2245 0.72). On the other hand, the resemblance with the ionosphere characteristics (EIA, PRE) is rather faint (R \u2245 0.37, R \u2245 0.12). It was shown that the thermosphere zonal winds are the most possible transfer mediator of the troposphere DE3 tide influence. The most successful moment for the transfer of the troposphere DE3 tide energy takes place in the beginning of the EPB production, namely, during the seed perturbation development.",

         "abstract": "Understanding the thermosphere and ionosphere conditions is crucial for spacecraft operations and many applications using radio signal transmission (e.g. in communication and navigation). In this sense, physics based modelling plays an important role, since it can adequately reproduce the complex coupling mechanisms in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system. The accuracy of the physics based model results does not only depend on the appropriate implementation of the physical processes, but also on the quality of the input data (forcing). In this study, we analyze the impact of input data uncertainties on the model results. We use the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere electrodynamics model (CTIPe), which requires satellite based solar wind, interplanetary field and hemispheric power data from ACE and TIROS/NOAA missions. To identify the impact of the forcing uncertainties, two model runs are compared against each other. The first run uses the input data that were available in real-time (operational) and the second run uses the best estimate obtained in post-processing (research or historical run). The analysis is performed in a case study on the 20th November 2003 extreme geomagnetic storm, that caused significant perturbations in the MIT system. This paper validates the thermosphere and ionosphere response to this storm over Europe comparing both CTIPe model runs with measurements of Total Electron Content (TEC) and thermosphere neutral density. In general, CTIPe results show a good agreement with measurements. However, the deviations between the model and observations are larger in the ionosphere than in the thermosphere. The comparison of the two model runs reveals that the deviations between model results and measurements are larger for the operational run than the research run. It is evident for the storm analyzed here, that data gaps in the input data are impacting considerably the model performance. The consistency between simulation and measurements allows the interpretation of the physical mechanisms behind the ionosphere perturbations and the changes in neutral composition during this event. Joule heating in the Auroral region, generating meridional winds and large scale surges, is suggested to be the main driver of the positive ionospheric storm over central Europe. In the polar cap and Auroral region, convection processes dominate the thermosphere-ionosphere conditions. This study does not only illustrate the importance of working with a good estimate of the model forcing, but also indicates the necessity of using measurements and models, to get a better understanding of the most likely responsible processes for the observed storm effects.",

For the same period, three different atmospheric models show over-estimation of temperature (\u223c10 K) near the stratopause and in the upper mesosphere, and a signature of under-estimation is seen above mesopause when compared against SABER measured temperature profiles. Estimation of monthly temperature anomalies reveals a semiannual and ter-annual oscillation moving downward from the mesosphere to the stratosphere during January to December. Moreover, Lomb Scargle periodogram (LSP) and Wavelet transform techniques are employed to characterize the semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations to diagnose the wave dynamics in the stratosphere-mesosphere system. Results suggested that semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations are exist in stratosphere, whereas, semi-annual and annual oscillations are observed in mesosphere. In lower mesosphere, LSP analyses revealed conspicuous absence of annual oscillations in altitude range of \u223c55-65 km, and semi-annual oscillations are not existing in 35-45 km. Four monthly oscillations are also reported in the altitude range of about 45-65 km. The temporal localization of oscillations using wavelet analysis shows strong annual oscillation during year 2004-2006 and 2009-2011.",

         "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to a theoretical interpretation of Interball-1 satellite measurements data in two cases of the satellite's crossings of the magnetosheath. An interpretation is made of both the measured crossings of the magnetosheath boundaries and the behavior of the registered plasma parameters. In our case, it is the value of the ion flux along the spacecraft trajectory. The magnetosheath-magnetosphere model, developed at the Institute of Mechanics, Sofia, Bulgaria, is used as a theoretical basis. It describes the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere in a simplified gas-dynamic approximation. A characteristic feature of the model is that it allows for the self-consistent description of the magnetosheath boundaries - the bow shock (BS) and the magnetopause (MP). The three-dimensional picture of the magnetosheath fluid flow is also obtained as part of the solution. The magnetosheath characteristics thus obtained are in correspondence with a given momentary state of the interplanetary medium, defined on the basis of WIND satellite data (appropriately shifted by time). The results are discussed in the context of advantages and limitations of using the gas-dynamic model for the interpretation of magnetosheath plasma measurements in the near-magnetopause magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification has recently been receiving much attention from aerospace engineering community. With ever-increasing requirements for robustness and reliability, it is crucial to quantify multidisciplinary uncertainty in satellite system design which dominates overall design direction and cost. However, coupled multi-disciplines and cross propagation hamper the efficiency and accuracy of high-dimensional uncertainty analysis. In this study, an uncertainty quantification methodology based on active subspaces is established for satellite conceptual design. The active subspace effectively reduces the dimension and measures the contributions of input uncertainties. A comprehensive characterization of associated uncertain factors is made and all subsystem models are built for uncertainty propagation. By integrating a system decoupling strategy, the multidisciplinary uncertainty effect is efficiently represented by a one-dimensional active subspace for each design. The identified active subspace is checked by bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals and verified by Monte Carlo propagation for the accuracy. To show the performance of active subspaces, 18 uncertainty parameters of an Earth observation small satellite are exemplified and then another 5 design uncertainties are incorporated. The uncertainties that contribute the most to satellite mass and total cost are ranked, and the quantification of high-dimensional uncertainty is achieved by a relatively small number of support samples. The methodology with considerably less cost exhibits high accuracy and strong adaptability, which provides a potential template to tackle multidisciplinary uncertainty in practical satellite systems.",

         "abstract": "The electron density of the topside ionosphere and the plasmasphere contributes essentially to the overall Total Electron Content (TEC) budget affecting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals. The plasmasphere can cause half or even more of the GNSS range error budget due to ionospheric propagation errors. This paper presents a comparative study of different plasmasphere and topside ionosphere data aiming at establishing an appropriate database for plasmasphere modelling. We analyze electron density profiles along the geomagnetic field lines derived from the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite/Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) records of remote plasma sounding with radio waves. We compare these RPI profiles with 2D reconstructions of the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere electron density derived from GNSS based TEC measurements onboard the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite. Most of the coincidences between IMAGE profiles and CHAMP reconstructions are detected in the region with L-shell between 2 and 5. In general the CHAMP reconstructed electron densities are below the IMAGE profile densities, with median of the CHAMP minus IMAGE residuals around -588 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Additionally, a comparison is made with electron densities derived from passive radio wave RPI measurements onboard the IMAGE satellite. Over the available 2001-2005 period of IMAGE measurements, the considered combined data from the active and passive RPI operations cover the region within a latitude range of \u00b160\u00b0N, all longitudes, and an L-shell ranging from 1.2 to 15. In the coincidence regions (mainly 2 \u2a7d L \u2a7d 4), we check the agreement between available active and passive RPI data. The comparison shows that the measurements are well correlated, with a median residual of \u223c52 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The RMS and STD values of the relative residuals are around 22% and 21% respectively. In summary, the results encourage the application of IMAGE RPI data for plasmasphere and plasmapause modeling.",

This is a first article on real time application of numerical methods to obtain the parameters of traveling ionosphere disturbances (TIDs) using vertical incident ionograms. In this paper, the distribution of ionosphere electron density with TIDs is constructed using a background ionosphere model superimposed a perturbation theory model. The background ionosphere electron density is modelled by the inversion of vertical incident ionograms which are observed before the appearance of the disturbance. Based on the fourth order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (the so-called ABM) predictor corrector method, instead of Runge-Kutta method, the fast digital ray tracing method is established. According to process of the disturbed trace simulation and parameters inversion, the characteristic parameters of ionosphere disturbance at different detection time can be obtained in real time. The numerical analysis of TIDs is then captured completely.",

         "abstract": "Presently, the ionosphere effect is the main source of the error in the Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. This effect can largely be removed by using the two-frequency measurements, while to obtain the reasonable results in the single-frequency applications, an accurate ionosphere model is required. Since the global ionosphere models do not meet our needs everywhere, the local ionosphere models are developed. In this paper, a rapid local ionosphere model over Iran is presented. For this purpose, the GPS observations obtained from 40 GPS stations of the Iranian Permanent GPS Network (IPGN) and 16 other GPS stations around Iran have been used. The observations have been selected under 2014 solar maximum, from the days 058, 107, 188 and 271 of the year 2014 with different geomagnetic activities. Moreover, ionospheric observables based on the precise point positioning (PPP) have been applied to model the ionosphere. To represent our ionosphere model, the B-spline basis functions have been employed and the variance component estimation (VCE) method has been used to regularize the problem. <P />To show the efficiency our PPP-derived local ionosphere model with respect to the International GNSS Service (IGS) global models, these models are applied on the single point positioning using single-frequency observations and their results are compared with the precise coordinates obtained from the double-differenced solution using dual-frequency observations. The results show that the 95th percentile of horizontal and vertical positioning errors of the single-frequency point positioning are about 3.1 and 13.6 m, respectively, when any ionosphere model are not applied. These values significantly improve when the ionosphere models are applied in the solutions. Applying CODE's Rapid Global ionosphere map (CORG), improvements of 59% and 81% in horizontal and vertical components are observed. These values for the IGS Global ionosphere map (IGSG) are 70% and 82%, respectively. The best results are obtained from our local ionosphere model, where 84% and 87% improvements in horizontal and vertical components are observed. These results confirm the efficiency of our local ionosphere model over Iran with respect to the global models. As a by-product, the Differential Code Biases (DCBs) of the receivers are also estimated. In this line, we found that the intra-day variations of the receiver DCBs could be significant. Therefore, these variations must be taken into account for the precise ionosphere modeling.",

The model-assisted technology for estimate of the upper boundary of the ionosphere, hup, from the slab thickness components in the bottomside and topside ionosphere - eliminating the plasmasphere contribution of \u03c4 - is applied at latitudes 35\u00b0 to 70\u00b0N and longitudes -10\u00b0 to 40\u00b0E, from the data of 20 observatories of GPS-TEC and ionosonde networks, for selected days and hours of October and November 2003. The daily-hourly values of NmF2, hmF2 and TECgps are used as the constrained parameters for the International Reference Ionosphere extended to the plasmasphere, IRI-Plas, during the ionospheric quiet days, positive and negative storm phases for estimate of \u03c4 and hup. Good correlation has been found between the slab thickness and the upper boundary of the ionosphere for the intense ionospheric storms at October-November 2003. During the negative phase of the ionospheric storm, when the ionospheric plasma density is exhausted, the nighttime upper boundary of the ionosphere is greatly uplifted towards the magnetosphere tail, while the daytime upper boundary of the ionosphere is reduced below 500 km over the Earth.",

Compared to the one at high latitudes, the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere exhibit strong spatio-temporal variability in the presence of really complex electrodynamic processes like among others the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly and the Equatorial Spread-F. In addition to this significant quiet-time variability, space weather events cause severe perturbations of the upper atmosphere through solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding on global characteristics of the thermosphere-ionosphere system are of vital importance to develop efficient models to meet the accuracy requirements of satellite-based communication and navigation applications. Further, the current 24th solar cycle is associated with several unique features, such as the deep and prolonged minimum, and the lowest maximum of the past hundred years, which triggered an increased interest to understand the upper atmospheric variability under such extreme and peculiar conditions.",

The maxima of the amplitude of the annual harmonics of zonal wind are much more pronounced than the respective maxima for meridional wind. In contrast, the magnitudes of the maxima of the semiannual harmonics are comparable between zonal and meridional wind. The annual harmonics of horizontal wind in the studied layer typically reaches maximum in January-February. The semiannual harmonics of the components of horizontal wind in the stratosphere-lower thermosphere layer basically attains it first maximum in spring or in early summer.

         "abstract": "The aurora shows explosive activities a few times in 24 hours on a moderately active day. This specific phenomenon is called the auroral substorm, which consists of the growth, expansion and recovery phases; the explosive activities occur during the expansion phase. As an introduction, the explosive activities of the aurora are morphologically described first on the basis of ground-based all-sky and satellite images. In terms of theoretical understanding, the processes for the explosive activities have been considered almost exclusively in terms of \u201cthe magnetic field line approach\u201d in the past, including the process of magnetic reconnection. Instead, in this paper, we consider the processes in terms of \u201cthe electric current line approach\u201d. This approach requires that the whole process of auroral substorms should be considered as a chain of processes, which consists of power supply (dynamo), transmission (currents/circuits) and dissipation (auroral substorms). An increased power of the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo (\u2248 5x1018 erg/s or 1011w) intensifies the electric currents mainly in the main body (just outside of the ring current) of the magnetosphere, resulting in accumulating energy in its inductive circuit and inflation of the magnetosphere. When the accumulated energy reaches about 5x1022 ergs (5x1015 J), the magnetosphere tends to become unstable (because of current instabilities). As the current intensity is reduced as a result, the magnetosphere is deflated. It is suggested that it is in this deflation process, during which the accumulated energy is unloaded, and an earthward electric field (5-50 mV/m) is produced on the equatorial plane, establishing the current system (the UL current system), which is responsible for the expansion phase, including the most characteristic features of the expansion phase, such as the poleward advance of the aurora and the development of the auroral electrojet. The electric current approach is rather new and needs much more effort to develop.",

         "abstract": "The response times of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system are, on average, greater than the autocorrelation timescales of solar wind forcing. This means that the system is rarely, if ever, in equilibrium. Departures from equilibrium are a key component of the Expanding-Contracting Polar Cap (ECPC) model of convection excitation in both the magnetosphere and ionosphere, driven by the Dungey reconnection cycle of opening and re-closing magnetospheric field lines. Averaging over sufficiently long timescales reduces data to the equivalent of steady-state conditions, which hides the physical mechanisms involved and allows us to map electric fields from interplanetary space to the ionosphere\u2013but this is not valid, either physically or generally, because of magnetic induction effects. Only for transient phenomena on sufficiently short timescales do the mechanisms associated with non-equilibrium fully manifest themselves. Nevertheless, because of both ever-changing solar wind conditions and Earth's dipole tilt, eccentricity and rotation, the magnetosphere is always tending towards a perpetually-evolving equilibrium configuration and there are important implications of transient events for understanding the general behavior of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system and its response to solar wind forcing. We here discuss one example: as a consequence of the importance of departures from equilibrium inherent in the ECPC model, the solar wind dynamic pressure PSW influences the magnetosphere-ionosphere convection response to the generation of open field lines by reconnection in the dayside subsolar magnetopause. We here demonstrate this effect in a statistical survey of observations and show that it is as predicted by the ECPC model and that, through it, PSW has an influence on flux transport in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

         "abstract": "The solar wind has been seen as the major source of hot magnetospheric plasma since the early 1960's. More recent theoretical and observational studies have shown that the cold (few eV) polar wind and warmer polar cusp plasma that flow continuously upward from the ionosphere can be a very significant source of ions in the magnetosphere and can become accelerated to the energies characteristic of the plasma sheet, ring current, and warm plasma cloak. Previous studies have also shown the presence of solar wind ions in these magnetospheric regions. These studies are based principally on proxy measurements of the ratios of He++/H+ and the high charge states of O+/H+. The resultant admixture of ionospheric and solar wind ions that results has been difficult to quantify, since the dominant H+ ions originating in the ionosphere and solar wind are indistinguishable. The ionospheric ions are already inside the magnetosphere and are filling it from the inside out with direct access from the ionosphere to the center of the magnetotail. The solar wind ions on the other hand must gain access through the outer boundaries of the magnetosphere, filling the magnetosphere from the outside in. These solar wind particles must then diffuse or drift from the flanks of the magnetosphere to the near-midnight reconnection region of the tail which takes more time to reach (hours) than the continuously large outflowing ionospheric polar wind (10's of minutes). In this paper we examine the magnetospheric filling using the trajectories of the different ion sources to unravel the intermixing process rather than trying to interpret only the proxy ratios. We compare the timing of the access of the ionospheric and solar wind sources and we use new merged ionosphere-magnetosphere multi-fluid MHD modeling to separate and compare the ionospheric and solar wind H+ source strengths. The rapid access of the cold polar wind and warm polar cusp ions flowing down-tail in the lobes into the mid-plane of the magnetotail, suggests thatm, coupled with a southward turning of the IMF Bz, these ions can play a key triggering role in the onset of substorms and larger storms.",

         "abstract": "The plasmapause marks the limit of the plasmasphere and is characterized by a sudden change in plasma density. This can influence the other regions of the magnetosphere, including due to different waves circulating inside and outside the plasmasphere. In the present work, we first compare the positions of the plasmapause measured by the NASA Van Allen Probes in 2015 with those of the SWIFF plasmasphere model (SPM). Using the Van Allen Probes and other satellite observations like PROBA-V, we investigate the links that can exist with the radiation belt boundaries. The inward motion of the outer radiation belt associated with sudden flux enhancements of energetic electrons can indeed be directly related to the plasmapause erosion during geomagnetic storms, suggesting possible links. Moreover, the position of the plasmapause projected in the ionosphere is compared with the ionospheric convection boundary. The equatorward motion of the plasmapause projected in the ionosphere is related to the equatorward edge motion of the auroral oval that goes to lower latitudes during storms due to the geomagnetic perturbation, like the low altitude plasmapause and the outer radiation belt. The links between these different regions are investigated during quiet periods, for which the plasmasphere is widely extended, as well as during geomagnetic storms for which plumes are generated, and then afterwards rotates with the plasmasphere. The magnetic local time dependence of these boundaries is especially studied on 14 March 2014 after a sudden northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and for the geomagnetic storm of 26 August 2018, showing the importance of the magnetic field topology and of the convection electric field in the interactions between these different regions eventually leading to the coupling between magnetosphere and ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Mesoscale (on the scales of a few minutes and a few RE) magnetosheath and magnetopause perturbations driven by foreshock transients have been observed in the flank magnetotail. In this paper, we present the 3D global hybrid simulation results to show qualitatively the 3D structure of the flank magnetopause distortion caused by foreshock transients and its impacts on the tail magnetosphere and the ionosphere. Foreshock transient perturbations consist of a low-density core and high-density edge(s), thus, after they propagate into the magnetosheath, they result in magnetosheath pressure perturbations that distort magnetopause. The magnetopause is distorted locally outward (inward) in response to the dip (peak) of the magnetosheath pressure perturbations. As the magnetosheath perturbations propagate tailward, they continue to distort the flank magnetopause. This qualitative explains the transient appearance of the magnetosphere observed in the flank magnetosheath associated with foreshock transients. The 3D structure of the magnetosheath perturbations and the shape of the distorted magnetopause keep evolving as they propagate tailward. The transient distortion of the magnetopause generates compressional magnetic field perturbations within the magnetosphere. The magnetopause distortion also alters currents around the magnetopause, generating field-aligned currents (FACs) flowing in and out of the ionosphere. As the magnetopause distortion propagates tailward, it results in localized enhancements of FACs in the ionosphere that propagate anti-sunward. This qualitatively explains the observed anti-sunward propagation of the ground magnetic field perturbations associated with foreshock transients.",

         "abstract": "The Sun's connection with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere is carried out through the exchange of electromagnetic and mass flux and is regulated by a complex interconnection of processes. During space weather events, solar flares or fast streams of solar atmosphere strongly disturb the Earth's environment. Often the electric currents that connect the different parts of the Sun-Earth system become unstable and explosively release the stored electromagnetic energy in one of the more dramatic expressions of space weather - the auroral storm and substorm. Some aspects of the magnetosphere-ionosphere connection that generates auroral arcs during space weather events are well-known. However, several fundamental problems remain unsolved because of the lack of unambiguous identification of the magnetic field connection between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The correct mapping between different regions of the magnetosphere and their foot-points in the ionosphere, coupled with appropriate distributed measurements of plasma and fields in focused regions of the magnetosphere, is necessary to establish unambiguously that a given magnetospheric process is the generator of an observed arc. The three most important problems for which the correct magnetic field mapping would provide closure to are the substorm growth phase arcs, the expansion phase onset arcs and the system of arcs that emerge from the magnetosphere-ionosphere connection during the development of the early substorm expansion phase phenomenon known as substorm current wedge (SCW). Energetic electron beams, used as magnetic field tracers, can enable the closure needed. However, the application of beams as tracers require demonstration that the beams can be injected into the loss cone, that the spacecraft potentials induced by the beam emission are manageable, and that sufficient electron flux reaches the atmosphere to be detectable by optical or radio means after the beam has propagated thousands of kilometers under competing effects of beam spread and constriction as well as effects of beam-induced instabilities. In this communication we provide a review of the latest results of synergistic research carried out under the NSF INSPIRE program to address these challenges and discuss the next steps toward the realization of active experiments in space using relativistic electron beams.",

         "abstract": "The geospace response to coronal mass ejections includes phenomena across many regions, from reconnection at the dayside and magnetotail, through the inner magnetosphere, to the ionosphere, and even to the ground. Phenomena occurring in each region are often connected to each other through the magnetic field, but that field undergoes dynamic changes during storms and substorms. Improving our understanding of the geospace response to storms requires a global picture that enables us to observe all the regions simultaneously with both spatial and temporal resolution. Using the Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) imager on the Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers (TWINS) mission, a temperature map can be calculated to provide a global view of the magnetotail. These maps are combined with in situ measurements at geosynchronous orbit from GOES 13 and 15, auroral images from all sky imagers (ASIs), and ground magnetometer measurements to examine the global geospace response of a coronal mass ejection (CME) driven event on March 12th, 2012. Mesoscale features in the magnetotail are observed throughout the interval, including prior to the storm commencement and during the main phase, which has implications for the dominant processes that lead to pressure buildup in the inner magnetosphere. Auroral enhancements that can be associated with these magnetotail features through magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling are observed to appear only after global reconfigurations of the magnetic field.",

         "abstract": "Precipitable water vapor (PWV) and ionospheric vertical total electron content (VTEC) are two essential components of space-atmosphere parameters. The zenith troposphere delay can be converted into PWV, which plays a crucial role in meteorological studies. In the meantime, the importance of the VTEC lies in providing ionospheric corrections for single-frequency (SF) positioning, navigation, and timing users. Currently, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has become one of the most commonly used tools for retrieving PWV and VTEC and normally relies on dual-frequency, geodetic-grade receivers and antennas. However, this reliance also implies high hardware costs. In this paper, we propose a single-frequency ionosphere and troposphere retrieval approach that enables the simultaneous retrieval of PWV and VTEC from multi-GNSS data collected by low-cost SF receivers. The use of SF receivers can greatly reduce the cost of hardware. Furthermore, the simultaneous provision of PWV and VTEC also has a positive effect on studying the coupling mechanisms of the ionosphere and troposphere. The accuracy of the estimated zenith troposphere delay can be better than 10 mm compared with the troposphere products published by the International GNSS Service, and the PWV is no more than 3 mm compared with radiosonde-derived results. Referring to the final International GNSS Service global ionosphere map products and the Jason altimeter data, the VTEC retrieved from the single-frequency ionosphere and troposphere retrieval method can perform at roughly equal levels compared to the customary dual-frequency method.",
