         "abstract": "Interactions between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere manifest many important space weather phenomena. In this paper, magnetosphere-ionosphere drivers of intense dB/dt produced during geomagnetic storms that occurred on 9 March 2012 and 17 March 2015 are analyzed. A multi-instrument approach combining Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission space-borne and ground-based observations was adopted to examine the magnetosphere-ionosphere signatures associated with the dB/dt extremes during each storm. To complement the THEMIS measurements, ground-based magnetometer recordings and All-Sky Imager observations, equivalent ionospheric currents derived from magnetometer chains across North America and Greenland, and geosynchronous observations from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer are also examined. Our results show that the most extreme dB/dt variations are associated with marked perturbations in the THEMIS magnetospheric measurements, poleward expanding discrete aurora passing over the magnetometer sites (seen by the ground-based THEMIS All-Sky Imagers), intense Pc5 waves, rapid injection of energetic particles, and intense auroral westward currents. Substorms are considered as the major driver with a possible contribution from magnetospheric waves. The findings of this study strongly suggest that the localization of extreme dB/dt variations is most likely related to the mapping of magnetosphere currents to local ionospheric structures.",

         "abstract": "Geomagnetic field data with high time resolution (typically 1 s) have recently become more commonly acquired by ground stations. Such high time resolution data enable identifying Pi2 pulsations which have periods of 40-150 s and irregular (damped) waveforms. It is well-known that pulsations of this type are clearly observed at mid- and low-latitude ground stations on the nightside at substorm onset. Therefore, with 1-s data from multiple stations distributed in longitude around the Earth's circumference, substorm onset can be regularly monitored. In the present study we propose a new substorm index, the Wp index (Wave and planetary), which reflects Pi2 wave power at low-latitude, using geomagnetic field data from 11 ground stations. We compare the Wp index with the AE and ASY indices as well as the electron flux and magnetic field data at geosynchronous altitudes for 11 March 2010. We find that significant enhancements of the Wp index mostly coincide with those of the other data. Thus the Wp index can be considered a good indicator of substorm onset. The Wp index, other geomagnetic indices, and geosynchronous satellite data are plotted in a stack for quick and easy search of substorm onset. The stack plots and digital data of the Wp index are available at the Web site (http://s-cubed.info) for public use. These products would be useful to investigate and understand space weather events, because substorms cause injection of intense fluxes of energetic electrons into the inner magnetosphere and potentially have deleterious impacts on satellites by inducing surface charging.",

         "abstract": "Ionospheric conductance is a crucial factor in regulating the closure of magnetospheric field-aligned currents through the ionosphere as Hall and Pedersen currents. Despite its importance in predictive investigations of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, the estimation of ionospheric conductance in the auroral region is precarious in most global first-principles-based models. This impreciseness in estimating the auroral conductance impedes both our understanding and predictive capabilities of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system during extreme space weather events. In this article, we address this concern, with the development of an advanced Conductance Model for Extreme Events (CMEE) that estimates the auroral conductance from field-aligned current values. CMEE has been developed using nonlinear regression over a year's worth of 1-min resolution output from assimilative maps, specifically including times of extreme driving of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The model also includes provisions to enhance the conductance in the aurora using additional adjustments to refine the auroral oval. CMEE has been incorporated within the Ridley Ionosphere Model (RIM) of the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) for usage in space weather simulations. This paper compares performance of CMEE against the existing conductance model in RIM, through a validation process for six space weather events. The performance analysis indicates overall improvement in the ionospheric feedback to ground-based space weather forecasts. Specifically, the model is able to improve the prediction of ionospheric currents, which impact the simulated dB/dt and \u0394B, resulting in substantial improvements in dB/dt predictive skill.",

Aurorasaurus provides easily understandable aurora information, basic gamification, and real-time location-based notification of verified aurora activity to engage citizen scientists. The Aurorasaurus project is one of only a handful of space weather citizen science projects and can provide useful results for the space weather and citizen science communities.

         "abstract": "Great magnetic storms are recorded as aurora sightings in historical documents. The earliest known example of \"prolonged\" aurora sightings, with aurora persistent for two or more nights within a 7 day interval at low latitudes, in Japan was documented on 21-23 February 1204 in Meigetsuki, when a big sunspot was also recorded in China. We have searched for prolonged events over the 600 year interval since 620 in Japan based on the catalogue of Kanda and over the 700 year interval since 581 in China based on the catalogues of Tamazawa et al. (2017) and Hayakawa et al. (2015). Before the Meigetsuki event, a significant fraction of the 200 possible aurora sightings in S\u00f2ng dynasty (960-1279) of China was detected at least twice within a 7 day interval and sometimes recurred with approximately the solar rotation period of 27 days. The majority of prolonged aurora activity events occurred around the maximum phase of solar cycles rather than around the minimum, as estimated from the <SUP>14</SUP>C analysis of tree rings. They were not reported during the Oort Minimum (1010-1050). We hypothesize that the prolonged aurora sightings are associated with great magnetic storms resulting from multiple coronal mass ejections from the same active region. The historical documents therefore provide useful information to support estimation of great magnetic storm frequency, which are often associated with power outages and other societal concerns.",

The extra electric currents can interfere with normal operation of these conductor systems; and thus, there is a great need for better specification and prediction of the field perturbations. In this publication we present CalcDeltaB, an efficient postprocessing tool to calculate magnetic perturbations \u0394B at any position on the ground from snapshots of the current systems that are being produced by first-principle models of the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system. This tool was developed during the recent \"dB/dt\" modeling challenge at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center that compared magnetic perturbations and their derivative with observational results. The calculation tool is separate from each of the magnetosphere models and ensures that the \u0394B computation method is uniformly applied, and that validation studies using \u0394B compare the performance of the models rather than the combination of each model and a built-in \u0394B computation tool that may exist. Using the tool, magnetic perturbations on the ground are calculated from currents in the magnetosphere, from field-aligned currents between magnetosphere and ionosphere, and the Hall and Pedersen currents in the ionosphere. The results of the new postprocessing tool are compared with \u0394B calculations within the Space Weather Modeling Framework model and are in excellent agreement. We find that a radial resolution of 1/30R<SUB>E</SUB> is fine enough to represent the contribution to \u0394B from the region of field-aligned currents.",

         "abstract": "An extensive investigation of ships' logs, as part of the Old Weather citizen-science project, identified a sunspot observation made from HMS Hilary on 10 February 1917. This sunspot record was accompanied by detailed meteorological records that have enabled a reconstruction of the conditions under which the observation was made (overcast with detached clouds). Although there is no incontrovertible evidence that this was an unaided-eye observation, comparison with an unaided-eye observation recorded on the 11 February 1917 in a local treatise from H\u00e9n\u00e1n province in China confirms that this sunspot group was visible to the unaided eye. White-light photographs from the Dehra Dun Observatory confirm the detailed description of the sunspot group provided by the naval observer. Moreover, comparisons with tabular data published by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, confirm the statement that this was an unusually large sunspot group. Indeed, on 11 February 1917 the area of the sunspot group was greater than the area of any sunspot group recorded previously at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. A comparison with a modern unaided-eye observation confirms that it is possible to observe sunspots under meteorological conditions similar to those experienced on-board HMS Hilary.",

Scientific models are becoming more important as tools for space weather operators' applications and for space weather forecasting. It is essential that operational users, forecasters, model developers, and the scientific community are aware of model capabilities and limitations. In our previous study we validated the performance of the WSA/ENLIL cone model combination in simulating the propagation of 14 events of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to the L1 point using the cone model approach for halo CMEs. In this short report we present the results of the uncertainty estimation for the WSA/ENLIL cone model combination studying the dependence of the arrival time of the CME shock and the magnitude of the CME impact on the magnetosphere on the uncertainty in the CME input parameters using three events from the previously reported 14 event list.",

         "abstract": "Modeling of electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and ionosphere depends on accurate specification of ionospheric conductances produced by auroral electron precipitation. Magnetospheric models determine the plasma properties on magnetic field lines connected to the auroral ionosphere, but the precipitation of energetic particles into the ionosphere is the result of a two-step process. The first step is the initiation of electron precipitation into both magnetic conjugate points from Earth's plasma sheet via wave-particle interactions. The second step consists of the multiple atmospheric reflections of electrons at the two magnetic conjugate points, which produces secondary superthermal electron fluxes. The steady state solution for the precipitating particle fluxes into the ionosphere differs significantly from that calculated based on the originating magnetospheric population predicted by magnetohydrodynamic and ring current kinetic models. Thus, standard techniques for calculating conductances from the mean energy and energy flux of precipitating electrons in model simulations must be modified to account for these additional processes. Here we offer simple parametric relations for calculating Pedersen and Hall height-integrated conductances that include the contributions from superthermal electrons produced by magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling in the auroral regions.",

The model uses information about the global state of the magnetosphere and its solar wind driving in the form of the Sym-H index averaged over substorm scales, its time derivative, and a similarly averaged solar wind electric field. The set of global parameters is used to bin a large number of points in a historical magnetic field database and to fit the model using only a part of the database composed of points taken at times when the global data-binning parameters were close to those at the time of interest. Transition from modeling to forecasting in such models requires a modification of their data binning procedure to use only the information about the state of the solar wind and the magnetosphere prior to the time of interest. This can be done using another (forecasting) set of binning parameters, which is optimized to provide the best prediction of the original (modeling) binning set. Several sets of such parameters are investigated. It is shown that the original (modeling) set contains spurious information, which appears because of the averaging of the solar wind electric field and Sym-H index over future moments in time. As a result, the problem of the optimization of the forecasting set becomes ill-posed, and the prediction efficiency of the original binning parameters, especially the averaged time derivative of the Sym-H index, is strongly limited. The predictions are shown to be substantially improved when the forecasting set includes an exponential decay function of the solar wind electric field proposed originally by Burton et al. (1975) with the e-folding time of the order of one hour.",

The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as the background model in the system. The slant total electron contents (TECs) from global International Global Navigation Satellite Systems Service ground-based receivers and from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate are assimilated into the system, and the ionosphere is then predicted in advance during the quiet interval of 23 to 27 March 2010. The predicted ionosphere vertical TEC (VTEC) and the critical frequency foF<SUB>2</SUB> are validated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology VTEC and global ionosondes network, respectively. We found that the ionosphere forecast quality could be enhanced by optimizing the thermospheric neutral components via the EnKF method. The ionosphere electron density forecast accuracy can be improved by at least 10% for 24 hr. Furthermore, the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics/Global Ultraviolet Imager (TIMED/GUVI) [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] observations are used to validate the predicted thermosphere [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>]. The validation shows that the [O/N<SUB>2</SUB>] optimized by EnKF has better agreement with the TIMED/GUVI observation. This study further demonstrates the validity of EnKF in enhancing the ionospheric forecast capability in addition to our previous observing system simulation experiments by He et al.

The use of PVPDs as a predictor of low-latitude ionospheric scintillation during the subsequent evening has previously been shown to have forecasting skill when using ionosonde data. The implementation of this approach using a physics-based model is proposed to provide greater forecast antecedence without the need for local ionosondes. For the first time, the physics-based model PVPD method is compared to another forecasting approach that uses a physics-based model to calculate Rayleigh-Taylor growth rates (RTGRs). In equinoctial test cases considered, when appropriate scintillation observation thresholds are selected, PVPD forecasting is shown to have skill similar to or better than the RTGR method using the same physics-based model. PVPD forecasting requires only electron densities and corresponding altitudes. Therefore, this approach could be applied using an ionospheric data assimilation model whereas the majority of these models do not provide output for all variables required for RTGR forecasting. The forecasting skill in these test cases, the simplicity of physics-based PVPD forecasting, and the suitability of this method for use of ionospheric data assimilation model output make this method attractive as a forecasting tool in an operational setting if skill can be further demonstrated for a wide range of conditions. However, both PVPD and RTGR forecasting skill are shown to be limited during solstitial months with high scintillation activity. This may be improved by using a data assimilation model.",

         "abstract": "The capability to forecast conditions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere is investigated based on 30-day hindcast experiments that were initialized bimonthly during 2009 and 2010. The hindcasts were performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. Analysis of the WACCMX+DART hindcasts reveals several important features that are relevant to forecasting the middle atmosphere. The results show a clear dependence on spatial scale, with the slowest error growth occurring in the zonal mean and the fastest error growth occurring for small-scale waves. The error growth rate is also found to be significantly greater in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere compared to in the upper stratosphere to lower mesosphere, suggesting that the forecast skill decreases with increasing altitude. The results demonstrate that the errors in the lower thermosphere reach saturation, on average, in less than 5 days, at least with the current version of WACCMX+DART. A seasonal dependency to the error growth is found at high latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres but not in the tropics or global average. We additionally investigate the error growth rates for migrating and nonmigrating atmospheric tides and find that the errors saturate after \u223c5 days for tides in the lower thermosphere. The results provide an initial assessment of the error growth rates in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere and are relevant for understanding how whole atmosphere models can potentially improve space weather forecasting.",

         "abstract": "Accurate specification of the thermosphere states is crucial to the low Earth orbit satellite operation. In this work, the impact of different ionosphere and thermosphere observing systems on the improvement of neutral temperature of the data assimilation model has been investigated by a series of observing system simulation experiments. The selected observations include the Global Navigation Satellite System total electron content (e.g., MIT vertical total electron content [VTEC]) and the daytime Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) level-2 disk temperature (T<SUB>disk</SUB>). Such observations are ingested into the coupled ionosphere and thermosphere model based on our developed ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation systems on the basis of the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. The main findings are as follows: (a) A considerable improvement of the neutral temperature estimation of the physical-based model can be obtained in the global region by assimilating either the MIT VTEC or the GOLD T<SUB>disk</SUB> observations; (b) the assimilation of the GOLD can further contribute to temperature improvement in the lower thermosphere (&lt;200 km), relative to the MIT VTEC assimilation; and (c) simultaneously assimilating both observation types can better improve the quality of neutral temperature estimation over the global area during the whole data assimilation process. The current results demonstrate that assimilating GOLD observations is important to improve the forecast capability of the physical-based model for the lower thermosphere states and can provide a possible reference for the joint assimilation of the ionosphere and thermosphere observations to better thermosphere specification.",

         "abstract": "Accurate ionospheric specification for the current and future is one of the key tasks in operational space weather. In this work, we have assessed the effect of a dense ground network consisting of different radio instruments either developed or under developing on ionosphere nowcasting and forecasting over China and adjacent region (0-60\u00b0N and 70-140\u00b0E) through observing system simulation experiments. The data assimilation system is an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation algorithm. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is used as a background model. Effects of different observation types, including the slant total electron content from Beidou System geostationary satellite and Global Position System and electron density observations from ionosondes and incoherent scattering radar on the ionospheric nowcasting and forecasting, are examined by the accurate specification of ionosphere key parameters (total electron content and 3-D electron density). We found that simultaneously assimilating different observation types can greatly improve the quality of ionosphere specification. Furthermore, updating the thermospheric state variables in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere forecast model in the assimilation step plays an important role in improving the ionosphere forecasting. The ionosphere forecasting capability can last longer (&gt;24 hr) in each observing system simulation experiment due to the adjusted thermosphere states. This study can provide a reference for observing system design over the China region and future ionosphere forecasting operation.",

The plasmasphere is believed to be embedded with cylindrical density structures (ducts) aligned along the Earth's magnetic field, but direct evidence for these remains scarce. Here we report the first direct wide-angle observation of an extensive array of field-aligned ducts bridging the upper ionosphere and inner plasmasphere, using a novel ground-based imaging technique. We establish their heights and motions by feature tracking and parallax analysis. The structures are strikingly organized, appearing as regularly spaced, alternating tubes of overdensities and underdensities strongly aligned with the Earth's magnetic field. These findings represent the first direct visual evidence for the existence of such structures.",

Probe A, located inside the plasmasphere in the postdawn sector, observed intense plasmaspheric hiss, whereas Probe B observed chorus waves outside the plasmasphere just before dawn. Dispersed injections of energetic electrons were observed in the dayside outer plasmasphere associated with significant intensification of plasmaspheric hiss at frequencies down to ~20 Hz, much lower than typical hiss wave frequencies of 100-2000 Hz. In the outer plasmasphere, the upper energy of injected electrons agrees well with the minimum cyclotron resonant energy calculated for the lower cutoff frequency of the observed hiss, and computed convective linear growth rates indicate instability at the observed low frequencies. This suggests that the unusual low-frequency plasmaspheric hiss is likely to be amplified in the outer plasmasphere due to the injected energetic electrons.",

         "abstract": "&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Abstract Ionospheric day-to-day variability is a ubiquitous feature, even in the absence of appreciable geomagnetic activities. Although meteorological perturbations have been recognized as an important source of the variability, it is not well represented in previous modeling studies and the mechanism is not well understood. This study demonstrates that the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) constrained in the stratosphere and mesosphere by the hourly whole atmosphere community climate model (WACCM) simulations is capable of reproducing observed features of day-to-day variability in the thermosphere-ionosphere. Realistic weather patterns in the lower atmosphere in WACCM were specified by Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis for Research and Application (MERRA). The day-to-day variations in mean zonal wind, migrating and nonmigrating tides in the thermosphere, vertical and zonal E \u00d7 B drifts, and ionosphere F2 layer peak electron density (NmF2) are examined. The standard deviations of the drifts and NmF2 show local time and longitudinal dependence that compare favorably with observations. Their magnitudes are 50% or more of those from observations. The day-to-day thermosphere and ionosphere variability in the model is primarily caused by the perturbations originated in lower atmosphere, since the model simulation is under constant solar minimum and low geomagnetic conditions.",

Not only are turbulence encounters a safety issue, they also result in millions of dollars of operational costs to airlines, leading to increased costs passed on to the consumer. For these reasons, pilots, dispatchers, and air traffic controllers attempt to avoid turbulence wherever possible. Accurate forecasting of aviation-scale turbulence has been hampered in part by a lack of understanding of the underlying dynamical processes. However, more precise observations of turbulence encounters together with recent research into turbulence generation processes is helping to elucidate the detailed dynamical processes involved and is laying the foundation for improved turbulence forecasting and avoidance. In this paper we briefly review some of the more important recent observational, theoretical, and modeling results related to turbulence at cruise altitudes for commercial aircraft (i.e., the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere), and their implications for aviation turbulence forecasting.",

The temperature observations show clear signatures of a mesospheric cooling and a thermospheric warming, the latter peaking at 120-140 km in agreement with model predictions. From the analysis of the zonal temperature structure during the SSW a pronounced wave 1 pattern was found in the entire middle and upper polar atmosphere with maximum amplitudes around 50 and 140 km. In the mesosphere, the wave amplitude is significantly damped. The wave amplification above is most likely produced by in situ forced planetary waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region. Our observations represent the first experimental evidence of a dynamical coupling of the lower atmosphere and the thermosphere in the 120-150 km range by means of satellite data.",

On 4 April 2014 concentric GW ring patterns were seen at stratospheric heights in close proximity to a convective storm over North Texas in the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder data on board the NASA Aqua satellite. Concentric GWs of similar orientation and epicenter were also observed in mesospheric nightglow measurements of the Day/Night Band of the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. Concentric TIDs were seen in total electron content data derived from ground-based GPS receivers distributed throughout the U.S. These new multisensor observations of TIDs and atmospheric GWs can provide a unique perspective on ionosphere-atmosphere coupling.",

In the absence of statistical information about plasma currents, theories of the magnetotail current sheets were mostly based on the isotropic stress balance. Such models suggest that thin current sheets cannot be long and should have strong plasma pressure gradients along the magnetotail. Using Magnetospheric Multiscale and THEMIS observations and global simulations, we explore realistic configuration of the magnetotail current sheet. We find that the magnetotail current sheet is thinner than expected from theories that assume isotropic stress balance. Observed plasma pressure gradients in thin current sheets are insufficiently strong (i.e., current sheets are too long) to balance the magnetic field line tension force. Therefore, pressure anisotropy is essential in the configuration of thin current sheets where instability precedes substorm onset.",

         "abstract": "The strong global semiannual oscillation (SAO) in thermospheric density has been observed for five decades, but definitive knowledge of its source has been elusive. We use the National Center of Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) to study how middle atmospheric dynamics generate the SAO in the thermosphere-ionosphere (T-I). The \"standard\" TIME-GCM simulates, from first principles, SAOs in thermospheric mass density and ionospheric total electron content that agree well with observed climatological variations. Diagnosis of the globally averaged continuity equation for atomic oxygen ([O]) shows that the T-I SAO originates in the upper mesosphere, where an SAO in [O] is forced by nonlinear, resolved-scale variations in the advective, net tidal, and diffusive transport of O. Contrary to earlier hypotheses, TIME-GCM simulations demonstrate that intra-annually varying eddy diffusion by breaking gravity waves may not be the primary driver of the T-I SAO: A pronounced SAO is produced without parameterized gravity waves.",

The zonal winds at 80-100 km height reversed approximately 10 days earlier than the zonal wind reversal in the stratosphere and the neutral temperature at 90 km decreased simultaneously with the zonal wind reversal at the same altitude. We found different variations between geomagnetically quiet nighttime ion temperatures at 101-110 km and 120-142 km for about 10 days around the SSW. Our results from the ground-based observations agree well with the satellite observations shown in an accompanying paper. Thus, this study indicates that a SSW is strongly linked to thermal structure and dynamics in the high-latitude mesosphere, lower thermosphere, and ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Understanding how a substorm current wedge (SCW) is formed is crucial to comprehending the substorm phenomenon. One SCW formation scenario suggests that the substorm time magnetosphere is coupled to the ionosphere via \"wedgelets,\" small building blocks of an SCW. Wedgelets are field-aligned currents (FACs) carried by elemental flux transport units known as dipolarizing flux bundles (DFBs). A DFB is a magnetotail flux tube with magnetic field stronger than that of the ambient plasma. Its leading edge, known as a \"dipolarization front\" or \"reconnection front,\" is a product of near-Earth reconnection. Dipolarizing flux bundles, and thus wedgelets, are localized\u2014each is only &lt;3 R<SUB>E</SUB> wide. How these localized wedgelets combine to become large-scale (several hours of magnetic local time) region-1-sense SCW FACs is unclear. To determine how this occurs, we investigated wedgelets statistically using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) data. The results show wedgelet asymmetries: in the dawn (dusk) sector of the magnetotail, a wedgelet has more FAC toward (away from) the Earth than away from (toward) the Earth, so the net FAC is toward (away from) the Earth. The combined effect of many wedgelets is therefore the same as that of large-scale region-1-sense SCW, supporting the idea that they comprise the SCW.",

A total of 26 events were found during which an Earth-like growth phase was followed by clear near-tail expansion phase signatures. During the growth phase, just as at Earth, the thinning of the plasma sheet and the increase of the magnetic field intensity in the lobe are observed, but the fractional increase in field intensity could be \u223c3 to 5 times that at Earth. The average timescale of the growth phase is \u223c1 min. The dipolarization that marks the initiation of the substorm expansion phase is only a few seconds in duration. During the expansion phase, lasting \u223c1 min, the plasma sheet is observed to thicken and engulf the spacecraft. The duration of the substorm observed in this paper is consistent with previous observations of Mercury's Dungey cycle. The reconfiguration of the magnetotail during Mercury's substorm is very similar to that at Earth despite its very compressed timescale.",

Due to their high vertical resolution and global coverage, RO data are well suited to describe the full 3-dimensional ENSO structure in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. We find that interannual temperature anomalies in the equatorial region show a natural decomposition into zonal-mean and eddy (deviations from the zonal-mean) components that are both related to ENSO. Consistent with previous studies, we find that during the warm phase of ENSO, zonal-mean temperatures increase in the tropical troposphere and decrease in the tropical stratosphere. Maximum warming occurs above 8 km, and the transition between warming and cooling occurs near the tropopause. This zonal-mean response lags sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific by 3 months. The atmospheric eddy component, in contrast, responds rapidly (within 1 month) to ENSO forcing. This signal features a low-latitude dipole between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with off-equatorial maxima centered around 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 latitude in both hemispheres. The eddy response pattern attains maximum amplitude in the upper troposphere near 11 km and (with opposite polarity) in a shallow layer near the tropopause at approximately 17 km. The eddy ENSO signal tends to be out-of-phase between low and middle latitudes in both the troposphere and lower stratosphere.",

         "abstract": "In early 2014, continuous monitoring with the Hisaki satellite discovered transient auroral emission at Jupiter during a period when the solar wind was relatively quiet for a few days. Simultaneous imaging made by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) suggested that the transient aurora is associated with a global magnetospheric disturbance that spans from the inner to outer magnetosphere. However, the temporal and spatial evolutions of the magnetospheric disturbance were not resolved because of the lack of continuous monitoring of the transient aurora simultaneously with the imaging. Here we report the coordinated observation of the aurora and plasma torus made by Hisaki and HST during the approach phase of the Juno spacecraft in mid-2016. On day 142, Hisaki detected a transient aurora with a maximum total H<SUB>2</SUB> emission power of 8.5 TW. The simultaneous HST imaging was indicative of a large \"dawn storm,\" which is associated with tail reconnection, at the onset of the transient aurora. The outer emission, which is associated with hot plasma injection in the inner magnetosphere, followed the dawn storm within less than two Jupiter rotations. The monitoring of the torus with Hisaki indicated that the hot plasma population increased in the torus during the transient aurora. These results imply that the magnetospheric disturbance is initiated via the tail reconnection and rapidly expands toward the inner magnetosphere, followed by the hot plasma injection reaching the plasma torus. This corresponds to the radially inward transport of the plasma and/or energy from the outer to the inner magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "The state of the mesosphere is connected to the lower atmosphere through various dynamical coupling processes. Nine years of Odin satellite observations of noctilucent clouds (NLC) have been analyzed as tracers for such processes. Inter-hemispheric coupling from the winter stratosphere and troposphere is confirmed to have a major influence on the summer mesosphere. Intra-hemispheric coupling from the spring/summer stratosphere, on the other hand, can control the onset of the NLC season. Most prominently, the southern NLC season 2010-2011 started with a delay of more than 20 days as compared to other years, which coincides with an exceptionally persistent polar vortex in the Antarctic stratosphere. Proposed mechanisms for the above teleconnections are based on the effect of lower atmospheric circulation on gravity wave filtering and, thus, on the dynamical forcing of the mesospheric circulation. Both intra- and inter-hemispheric coupling processes are needed for an understanding of the overall seasonal behavior of the summer mesosphere.",

By examining simultaneous low-altitude satellites and ground observations, we confirm that the throat auroras are associated with low-energy electron and ion precipitation of magnetosheath type and thus provide the first evidence that they occur along open magnetic field lines. Additionally, the observations have important possible implications: (1) solar wind particles can penetrate deep into the magnetosphere and may make significant contributions to the low-energy plasmas often observed in the dayside outer magnetosphere and (2) localized shapes of the magnetopause and the ionospheric open-closed field line boundary may be substantially changed, during generation of the throat aurora.",

We use the coupled SAMI3-Rice Convention Model (RCM) of the global ionosphere and inner magnetosphere, with self-consistent electrodynamics, to simulate the 31 March 2001 magnetic storm. We find that the penetration electric fields associated with the magnetic storm lead to a storm time-enhanced density (SED) in the low- to middle-latitude ionosphere and that the separation in latitude of the Appleton anomaly peaks increases. The SED exhibits magnetic conjugacy, occurring in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Moreover, mapping the boundary of the SED into the equatorial plane coincides with the development of a \"plume-like\" structure in the plasmasphere. These preliminary results are consistent with observations.",

         "abstract": "It has recently been suggested that observations of neutral density from satellite accelerometer data indicate a strong cooling occurred in the upper thermosphere during the January 2009 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). The 2009 warming was a major event with winter polar stratospheric temperatures increasing by 70 K. This January period has been re-examined with three independent models: the NRLMSISE-00 empirical model; the physics-based coupled thermosphere, ionosphere, plasmasphere, electrodynamics model (CTIPe); and the whole atmosphere model (WAM). The analysis of this period and comparison with the neutral density observations reveals that there is, in fact, no evidence at any latitude for a large-scale or global decrease in upper thermosphere density or temperature in response to the SSW. The observed decrease in density and temperature can be amply accounted for by small changes in geomagnetic activity during this period. On the contrary, the WAM numerical simulations of the period suggest a possible small globally averaged upper thermosphere warming and neutral density increase by 5% during the SSW. This warming would have been difficult to discern in the local-time sampling of the CHAMP observations due to likely change in the diurnal density variation during the SSW, and due to a much larger contribution to the variability from geomagnetic sources. At this stage, therefore, it is not possible to ascertain if a cooling or warming occurred in the upper thermosphere in response to the stratospheric warming.",

The number of substorms and substorm mean duration depict an annual variation with maxima in Winter and Summer, respectively, reflecting the annual change of the local ionosphere. In contradiction, substorm mean amplitude, substorm total efficiency and global geomagnetic activity show a dominant annual variation, with equinoctial maxima alternating between Spring in solar cycle 22 and Fall in cycle 23. The largest annual variations were found in 1994 and 2003, in the declining phase of the two cycles when high-speed streams dominate the solar wind. A similar, large annual variation is found in the solar wind driver of substorms and geomagnetic activity, which implies that the annual variation of substorm strength, substorm efficiency and geomagnetic activity is not due to ionospheric conditions but to a hemispherically asymmetric distribution of solar wind which varies from one cycle to another. Our results imply that the overall semiannual variation in global geomagnetic activity has been seriously overestimated, and is largely an artifact of the dominant annual variation with maxima alternating between Spring and Fall. The results also suggest an intimate connection between the asymmetry of solar magnetic fields and some of the largest geomagnetic disturbances, offering interesting new pathways for forecasting disturbances with a longer lead time to the future.",

         "abstract": "Evidence of stratosphere-troposphere coupling at inter-decadal time scales is searched for in a 260-year simulation performed with a climate model including a state-of-the-art stratosphere. The boundary conditions of the simulation are specified according to preindustrial conditions and are kept constant from year to year. It is shown that long lasting (\u223c20 years) positive and negative anomalies of the northern winter stratospheric polar vortex exist in the simulation. Given that there are no externally imposed low frequency time variations, these persistent variations are due to internal dynamical processes of the modeled coupled atmosphere ocean system. By composite analysis, it is shown that the long lasting stratospheric vortex anomalies are connected through the troposphere to mean sea level pressure, surface temperature and sea ice cover anomalies. These connections are reminiscent of intra-seasonal stratosphere-troposphere coupling. Over the ocean, the surface temperature and sea ice cover anomalies are indicative of the delayed Atlantic meridional overturning circulation response to atmospheric forcing. The latter is indeed found to be anomalously strong/weak during the long lasting positive/negative stratospheric vortex anomalies, providing evidence for a potential role of the stratosphere in decadal prediction.",

This is probably the first unequivocal determination of the substorm SAPS onset timing. The time lag between the SAPS and substorm onsets is much shorter than the gradient-curvature drift time of \u223c10 keV ions in the plasmasphere. It seemingly depends on the propagation time of substorm-injected plasma from the dipolarization onset region to the plasmasphere, as well as on the SAPS position. These observations suggest that fast onset SAPS and ring current injections are causally related to the two-loop system of the westward traveling surge.",

         "abstract": "We examine the global field-aligned current (FAC) topology associated with a clear substorm on the 16 February 2010. We show that for this particular substorm there is a clear and localised reduction in the FACs observed by AMPERE at least 6 minutes prior to auroral onset. A new auroral arc forms in the region of reduced FAC and on closed field lines which subsequently brightens and expands poleward, signifying the start of the substorm expansion phase. We argue that the change in FACs observed prior to onset is the result of a change in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling in a region local to the subsequent auroral onset. Such a change implies an important role for M-I coupling in destabilising the near-Earth tail during magnetospheric substorms and perhaps more importantly in selecting the location in the ionosphere where auroral onset begins.",

We conduct a minimum variance analysis to infer the generation processes of magnetotail flux ropes from the geometrical configuration of the individual flux rope axial orientation with respect to the overall current sheet. Of 23 flux ropes detected in current sheets in the near-Mars (\u223c1-3 Martian radii downstream) magnetotail, only 3 (possibly 4) can be explained by the magnetotail reconnection scenario, while the vast majority of the events (19 events) are more consistent with flux ropes that are originally generated in the dayside ionosphere and subsequently transported into the nightside magnetotail. The mixed origins of the detected flux ropes imply complex nature of generation and transport of Martian magnetotail flux ropes.",

MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) observations from two orbits on 10 November 2012 have been analyzed. The main plasma mantle features are (1) a steady decrease in proton density as MESSENGER moved deeper into the magnetotail; (2) frequent flux transfer events throughout the magnetosheath and into the magnetotail, suggesting that these events are the primary source for solar wind plasma injection; (3) a diamagnetic depression, due to the presence of plasma, as pressure balance is maintained; and (4) a clear proton velocity dispersion, resulting from lower-energy protons being transported deep into the magnetosphere as higher-energy protons escape downtail. From these velocity dispersions we infer cross-magnetosphere electric potentials of 23 kV and 29 kV, consistent with estimates determined from measurements of magnetopause reconnection rate and tail loading and unloading events.",

Plasma sheet pressure increases to balance magnetic flux density increases in the lobes. Here we examine plasma sheet pressure, density, and temperature during substorm growth phases using 9 years of Cluster data (&gt;316,000 data points). We show that plasma sheet pressure and temperature are higher during growth phases with higher solar wind driving, whereas the density is approximately constant. We also show a weak correlation between plasma sheet temperature before onset and the minimum SuperMAG AL (SML) auroral index in the subsequent substorm. We discuss how energization of the plasma sheet before onset may result from thermodynamically adiabatic processes; how hotter plasma sheets may result in magnetotail instabilities, and how this relates to the onset and size of the subsequent substorm expansion phase.",

Early Pioneer Venus observations during the solar maximum revealed that the Venus ionosphere exhibits two magnetic states depending on the solar wind dynamic pressure conditions: magnetized ionosphere with large-scale horizontal magnetic field; or unmagnetized ionosphere with numerous small-scale thin structures, so-called flux ropes. Here we report yet another magnetic state of Venus' ionosphere, giant flux ropes in the magnetized ionosphere, using Venus Express magnetic field measurements during solar minimum. These giant flux ropes all have strong core fields and diameters of hundreds of kilometers, which is about the vertical dimension of the ionosphere. This finding represents the first observation of these giant flux ropes at Venus. The cause of these giant flux ropes remains unknown and speculative.",

         "abstract": "Near-Earth magnetic reconnection reconfigures the magnetotail and produces strong plasma flows that transport plasma sheet particles and electromagnetic energy to the inner magnetosphere. An essential element of such a reconfiguration is strong, transient field-aligned currents. These currents, believed to be generated within the plasma sheet and closed at the ionosphere, are responsible for magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling during substorms. We use conjugate measurements from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) at the plasma sheet boundary (around x \u223c- 10R<SUB>E</SUB>) and Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) at the equator (around x \u223c- 60R<SUB>E</SUB>) to explore the potential generation region of these currents. We find a clear correlation between the field-aligned current intensity measured by MMS and the tailward plasma sheet flows measured by ARTEMIS. To better understand the origin of this correlation, we compare spacecraft observations with results from 3-D particle-in-cell simulations of magnetotail reconnection. The comparison reveals that field-aligned currents and plasma flows start, wax, and wane due to the development of a reconnection region between MMS (near-Earth) and ARTEMIS (at lunar distance). A weak correlation between the field-aligned current intensity at MMS and earthward flow magnitudes at ARTEMIS suggests that distant magnetotail reconnection does not significantly contribute to the generation of the observed near-Earth currents. Our findings support the idea that the dominant role of the near-Earth magnetotail reconnection in the field-aligned current generation is likely responsible for their transient nature, whereas more steady distant tail reconnection would support long-term field-aligned current system.",

The typical flapping period in Mercury's magnetotail is much shorter (~13 s), comparing with ~10-20 min at Earth's magnetotail. The magnetic field oscillation amplitude induced by flapping motion is larger near both flanks than that around tail center. Similar to Earth's magnetotail, there are two flapping types existent in Mercury's magnetotail, one is the kink-like flapping that can propagate as traveling waves, and the other one is the steady flapping that does not propagate. Both flapping types distribute widely in magnetotail. The kink-like flapping waves propagating either dawnward or duskward can be observed across the entire magnetotail current sheet, which suggests that the energy sources for triggering the kink-like flapping waves should locate around both tail flanks instead of tail center as is for the Earth's magnetotail.",

This approach has the potential to transform research and operations in snow-dominated regions, but sources of uncertainty need quantification. We compared relative uncertainty contributions from lidar depth measurement and density modeling to SWE estimation, utilizing lidar data from the Tuolumne Basin (California). We found a density uncertainty of 0.048 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> by comparing output from four models. For typical lidar depth uncertainty (8 cm), density estimation was the dominant source of SWE uncertainty when snow exceeded 60 cm depth, representing &gt;70% of snow cover and 90% of SWE volume throughout the basin in both 2014 and 2016. Density uncertainty accounts for 75% of the SWE uncertainty for a broader range of snowpack characteristics, as measured at SNOTEL stations throughout the western U.S. Reducing density uncertainty is essential for improved SWE mapping with lidar.",

We have studied one southward IMF turning observed by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) and GOES in the dayside magnetosphere. Using a global MHD model, we have reproduced the magnetopause motion in this event. We find that the observed delay in the ground response can be completely explained by deceleration of the directional discontinuity in the subsolar magnetosheath. We show that the speed of the discontinuity significantly decreases in the vicinity of the magnetopause where the magnetic barrier formed during the previous northward IMF interval. The southward turning can reach the magnetopause only after complete disruption of the magnetic barrier. The disruption or dissipation occurs via magnetosheath reconnection, as confirmed by high-speed jets in the magnetosheath. The magnetopause moves sunward as the directional discontinuity transits the magnetosheath. This sunward motion is followed by the earthward motion when the discontinuity strikes the magnetopause and magnetopause reconnection begins.",

Using the wave and particle data of Van Allen Probes, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, and Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorm spacecraft, we here examine the nightside plasmaspheric hiss generation during a substorm. The substorm-electron injection caused the plasmapause to shrink promptly from L<SUB>pp</SUB>=6.6 to 5.1. Corresponding to the azimuthal drift of the injected electrons, the plasmaspheric hiss was intensified gradually from nightside to dayside. Particularly, in the inner postmidnight plasmasphere free from the substorm injection, the instantaneous peak amplitude of hiss reached 0.9 nT. The enhanced hiss within the locally unchanged plasma must originate from other spatial regions. Our data and modeling demonstrate that the large-amplitude hiss was generated by the substorm-injected electrons drifting into the outer postmidnight plasmasphere, rather than linked to the nightside chorus suffering strong Landau damping or the dayside chorus/hiss propagating azimuthally to the nightside plasmasphere.",

PMWE were observed by mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) radar during solar proton events (SPEs) and auroral substorms. We supplement the MST radar measurements with profiles of temperature and turbulent velocity from co-located Rayleigh lidar and medium frequency (MF) radar, respectively, as well as temperature data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard the Aura satellite. We establish that SH PMWE exhibit similar characteristics to their well-studied northern hemisphere counterpart. Significantly our observations reveal that these radar echoes in the lower mesosphere (\u223c50-80 km) can occur year-round, and on occasions simultaneously in both hemispheres. We report the seasonal occurrence distribution of SH PMWE is linked to the seasonal distribution of atmospheric turbulence in the lower mesosphere. We hypothesise that given sufficient turbulent velocities in the neutral atmosphere and co-located gradients in electron density, PMWE can occur throughout the year. However they are more likely in winter when turbulent velocities in the lower mesosphere maximise.",

There has been a precipitous decrease in particles accelerated in the heliosphere and a substantial increase in galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The evidence is unclear, however, as to whether Voyager 1 has crossed the heliopause into the local interstellar medium or remains within the heliosheath. In this Letter we propose a test that will determine whether Voyager 1 has crossed the heliopause: If Voyager 1 remains in the heliosheath, the high densities observed must be due to compressed solar wind, with the consequence that Voyager 1 will encounter another current sheet, where the polarity of the magnetic field reverses. Voyager 1 observations can be used to predict that the next current sheet crossing is likely to occur during 2015.",

         "abstract": "Traditionally, it is widely assumed that the source of electron precipitation in the region of diffuse aurora is wave-particle interaction processes in the Earth's plasmasheet. It is difficult to imagine that ionosphere-thermosphere system is also actively involved in the formation of electron precipitation and provides a very noticeable energy contribution to this process. In this study, we use specifically designed simulation scenarios of the SuperThermal Electron Transport code to clearly distinguish between the magnetospheric and ionospheric contributions to the precipitating electrons in the region of diffuse aurora. It is demonstrated that atmospheric collisional processes and the overall magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere energy circulation dynamics, with the participation of two magnetically conjugate hemispheres, play a very important role in the formation of electron energy fluxes that are coming from the magnetosphere.",

In particular, how the ionosphere variability due to the October 2003 Halloween storm would be different if it occurred in January coincident with a major sudden stratosphere warming (SSW) event is investigated. The TIE-GCM simulations reveal that the E\u00d7 B vertical drift velocity and total electron content (TEC) respond differently to the geomagnetic forcing when the lower atmosphere forcing is representative of SSW conditions compared to climatological lower atmosphere forcing conditions. Notably, the storm time variations in the E\u00d7 B vertical drift velocity differ when the SSW-induced zonal mean and tidal variability in the lower thermosphere are considered, and this is in part due to effects of the SSW on the equatorial ionosphere being potentially misinterpreted as being of geomagnetic origin. Differences in the TEC response to the geomagnetic storm can be up to 100% (\u223c30 TEC unit (TECU: 1 TECU = 10<SUP>16</SUP> el m<SUP>-2</SUP>)) of the storm-induced TEC change, and the temporal variability of the TEC during the storm recovery phase is considerably different if SSW effects are considered. The results demonstrate that even during periods of extreme geomagnetic forcing, it is important to consider the effects of lower atmosphere forcing on the ionosphere variability.",

However, the concept that a solar eclipse impacts polar ionosphere behavior and dynamics as well as magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling has not been appreciated. In this study, we investigate the potential impact of the 21 August 2017 solar eclipse on the polar tongue of ionization (TOI) using a high-resolution, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics model. The reduction of electron densities by the eclipse in the middle latitude TOI source region leads to a suppressed TOI in the polar region. The TOI suppression occurred when the solar eclipse moved into the afternoon sector. The Global Positioning System total electron content observations show similar tendency of polar region total electron content suppression. This study reveals that a solar eclipse occurring at middle latitudes may have significant influences on the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

The investigation is based on observations of five THEMIS spacecraft located at the dawn flank in the magnetosphere and magnetosheath, on Cluster measurements at the dusk magnetosheath, and is supported by ACE solar wind monitoring. The main revelation of our study is that the interaction of the IMF discontinuity with the bow shock creates either one very elongated hot flow anomaly (HFA) or a pair of them that is (are) simultaneously observed at both flanks. Whereas the dusk HFA is weak and does not cause observable deformation of the magnetopause, the pressure variations connected with the dawn HFA lead to a magnetopause displacement by \u22485 R<SUB>E</SUB> outward from its nominal position. This is followed by a rapid inward motion of the magnetopause \u22484 R<SUB>E</SUB> inward with respect to the model location. The surface deformation is so large that the outermost THEMIS spacecraft was in the magnetosphere, whereas the spacecraft located 9 R<SUB>E</SUB> inbound entered into the magnetosheath at the same time. The whole event lasted about 5 minutes.",

We use the magnetically and electrically self-consistent Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E) of the inner magnetosphere to assess how well different electron loss models can account for observed electron fluxes during the large 10 August 2000 magnetic storm. The strong pitch angle scattering rate produces excessive loss on the morning and dayside at geosynchronous orbit (GEO) compared to what is observed by a Los Alamos National Laboratory satellite. RCM-E simulations with parameterized scattering due to whistler chorus outside the plasmasphere and hiss inside the plasmasphere are able to account simultaneously for trapped electron fluxes at 1.2 keV to ~100 keV observed at GEO and for precipitating electron fluxes and electron characteristic energies in the ionosphere at 833 km measured by the NOAA 15 satellite.",

         "abstract": "It is well-known that solar eclipses can significantly impact the ionosphere and thermosphere, but how an eclipse influences the magnetosphere-ionosphere system is still unknown. Using a coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere model, we examined the impact on geospace of the northern polar-region eclipse that occurred on June 10, 2021. The simulations reveal that the eclipse-induced reduction in polar ionospheric conductivity causes large changes in field-aligned current, cross-polar cap potential and auroral activity. While such effects are expected in the northern hemisphere where solar obscuration occurred, they also occurred in the southern hemisphere through electrodynamic coupling. Eclipse-induced changes in monoenergetic auroral precipitation differ significantly between the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere while diffuse auroral precipitation is interhemispherically symmetric. This study demonstrates that the geospace response to a polar-region solar eclipse is not limited just to the eclipse region but has global implications.",

This implementation provides, for the first time, a modeling capability to describe macroscopic effects of the FBI on the ionosphere and thermosphere in the context of a first-principle, self-consistent model. The added heating sources primarily operate between 100 and 130 km altitude, and their magnitudes often exceed auroral precipitation heating in the TIEGCM. The induced changes in E region electron temperature in the auroral oval and polar cap by the FBI are remarkable with a maximum T<SUB>e</SUB> approaching 2200 K. This is about 4 times larger than the TIEGCM run without FBI heating. This investigation demonstrates how researchers can add the important effects of the FBI to magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere models and simulators.",

         "abstract": "We report a new modeling capability that self-consistently couples physics-based magnetospheric electron precipitation with its impact on the ionosphere. Specifically, the ring current model RAM-SCBE is two-way coupled to an ionospheric electron transport model GLOW (GLobal airglOW), representing a significant improvement over previous models, in which the ionosphere is either treated as a 2-D spherical boundary of the magnetosphere or is driven by empirical precipitation models that are incapable of capturing small-scale, transient variations. The new model enables us to study the impact of substorm-associated, spectrum-resolved electron precipitation on the 3-D ionosphere. We found that after each substorm injection, a high-energy tail of precipitation is produced in the dawn sector outside the plasmapause, by energetic electrons (10 &lt; E &lt; 100 keV) scattered by whistler-mode chorus waves. Consequently, an ionospheric sublayer characterized by enhanced Pedersen conductivity arises at unusually low altitude (\u223c85 km), with its latitudinal width of \u223c5-10\u00b0 in the auroral zone. The sublayer structure appears intermittently, in correlation with recurrent substorm injections. It propagates eastward from the nightside to the dayside in the same drift direction of source electrons injected from the plasma sheet, resulting in global impact within the ionosphere. This study demonstrates the model's capability of revealing complex cross-scale interactions in the geospace environment.",

Given zonal mean patterns of radiative forcing, radiative feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake, the MEBM accurately predicts zonal mean warming as simulated by general circulation models under increased CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Over a wide range of latitudes, the MEBM captures approximately 90% of the variance in zonal mean warming across the general circulation models, with approximately 70% of the variance attributable to differences in radiative feedbacks alone. Partitioning the radiative feedbacks into individual components shows that the majority of the uncertainty in the meridional pattern of warming arises from uncertainty in cloud feedbacks. Isolating feedback uncertainty within specific regions demonstrates that tropical feedback uncertainty leads to surface warming uncertainty that is global and nearly uniform with latitude, whereas polar feedback uncertainty leads to surface warming uncertainty that is largely confined to the poles.",

         "abstract": "Based on the ensemble spread, a methodology of measuring uncertainty in weather forecasts, the temperature trend and spread have been estimated using five radiosonde data sets and seven reanalysis products beginning in 1989. The results show that the magnitude of warming or cooling depends on the data sources, atmospheric heights, and geophysical latitudes. Over low-middle latitudes, the cooling varies from -2.6 K/decade in NCEP-DOE to -0.8 K/decade in HADAT2 in the lower stratosphere. The warming weakly changes from 0.2 through 0.4 K/decade in the middle troposphere. Over Antarctica, there is a pronounced warming in the low-middle troposphere in the three NCEP reanalyses and the RATPAC radiosonde data sets, and cooling in the other eight products. Over the Arctic, the warming is observed from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere in all twelve data sets. Significant cooling is identified over the middle stratosphere (above 50 hPa) in all five radiosondes. For global mean temperature, the trend is approximately 0.2 K/decade in the troposphere and -0.8 K/decade in the stratosphere. The spread increases significantly with atmospheric height from approximately 0.1 K/decade at 850hPa to 0.8 K/decade at 30hPa. The spread in the reanalysis data sets is much larger than in the radiosondes in the stratosphere. In contrast, the spread in both the reanalysis and radiosondes data sets is very small and shows the trend in better agreement with each other in the troposphere.",

However, it remains unclear for monsoon precipitation projections. Here we quantified the contributions of internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty to the ensemble spread of global land monsoon precipitation projections using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models and single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). For mean precipitation, model uncertainty (contributing ~90%) dominates the projection uncertainty, while the contribution of internal variability (scenario uncertainty) decreases (increases) with time. The source of uncertainty for extreme precipitation differs from that of mean precipitation mainly in long-term projection, with the contribution of scenario uncertainty comparable to model uncertainty. Reducing model uncertainty can effectively narrow the monsoon precipitation projection. The internal variability estimates differ slightly among models and methods, the uncertainty partitioning is robust in middle-long term.",

Meteor radar (MR) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)-2 observations indicate that the zonal wind reversal was descended with time, and the reversal was larger over ~72\u00b0S than the MR site (62\u00b0S). The MR detected the PWs of 14-22 days before and 8-12 days following the SSW in the mesosphere. We further noticed the enhancement of wavenumber 1 signature in the mesosphere during the peak SSW over the polar region. Thus, the polar middle-atmosphere is greatly affected by the SSW.",

Individual Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph pixels were projected onto the ionosphere of Saturn, transformed into the SLS4 north and SLS4 south longitude systems, accumulated over all over auroral observations from 2007 to early 2009, and binned into 1\u00b0\u00d71\u00b0 bins of colatitude. The intensity of the northern aurora showed little variation in its SLS4 north system, but the intensity of the southern aurora exhibited an enhancement of over ~10 kR between ~140-280\u00b0 SLS4 south longitude. This enhancement may represent the auroral signature of a southern ionospheric vortex proposed in MHD models of Saturn's magnetosphere to explain its periodicities. The loci of the northern intensity peaks and the 3 kR boundaries varied little over 360\u00b0 of longitude, while the equatorward boundary of the southern aurora varied by ~5\u00b0 in SLS4 south longitude, reaching its most equatorward location of ~23\u00b0 colatitude between 100\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 longitude. The polygonal centroids of the aurora in both north and south were consistent with offsets of no more than ~1\u00b0 in both hemispheres.",

Previous research has hinted that a substorm onset may be required before the magnetosphere can enter the SMC mode of response. For the first time, we show statistically that nearly all SMC events are preceded by a substorm. Only 1% of SMC events occur without any preceding substorm signatures. The typical magnetospheric reaction to enhanced solar wind driving is a substorm. After this occurs, we find that the duration and stability of southward IMF determines whether a particular substorm will transition into an SMC event or not. The initial substorm sets up a high pressure region in the inner magnetosphere that causes flux diversion to the flanks, which allows closed flux from the nightside x-line to return to balance the dayside reconnection rate.",

Very stable and reliable performance was demonstrably achieved during more than 2,500 hr of operations time experiencing a huge variety of weather conditions. ARTHUS provides temperature profiles with resolutions of 10-60 s and 7.5-100 m vertically in the lower free troposphere. During daytime, the statistical uncertainty of the water vapor mixing ratio is &lt;2 % in the lower troposphere for resolutions of 5 min and 100 m.

         "abstract": "In the diffuse aurora, magnetospheric electrons, initially precipitated from the inner plasma sheet via wave-particle interaction processes, degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies, and produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These initially precipitating electrons of magnetospheric origin can also be additionally reflected back into the magnetosphere, leading to a series of multiple reflections by the two magnetically conjugate atmospheres that can greatly impact the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km). The resultant population of secondary and primary electrons cascades toward lower energies and escape back to the magnetosphere. Escaping upward electrons traveling from the ionosphere can be trapped in the magnetosphere, as they travel inside the loss cone, via Coulomb collisions with the cold plasma, or by interactions with various plasma waves. Even though this scenario is intuitively transparent, this magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling element is not considered in any of the existing diffuse aurora research. Nevertheless, as we demonstrate in this letter, this process has the potential to dramatically affect the formation of electron precipitated fluxes in the regions of diffuse auroras.",

The ozone reduction in the stratosphere and troposphere following the eruption is simulated by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model and is in good agreement with the ozonesonde observations. Simulated anomalies in the global stratosphere-troposphere flux of ozone following the eruption are well correlated with those in the tropospheric ozone column. Both are at their minimum in late 1992 to early 1993 (-70 Tgyr<SUP>-1</SUP> in January 1993 for the flux and -1.9 Dobson Unit in November 1992 for tropospheric ozone) and recover after 1995. Therefore, this study identifies the reduced stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux as an important driver of the ozone decline in the troposphere following the eruption. A large fraction (67%) of the decrease in the flux is compensated by an increase in tropospheric photochemical ozone production. While both the strength of the residual circulation and the decrease in stratospheric ozone reduce the stratospheric ozone flux, the ozone reduction is identified as the dominant cause.",

If the first adiabatic invariant is conserved, these electrons would reach the conjugate ionosphere without trapping in the magnetosphere. Here we show, by using quasi-linear diffusion theory, that electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves can diffuse these low-energy electrons in pitch angle via Doppler-shifted cyclotron resonance and trap them in the magnetosphere. We show that energy diffusion is comparable to pitch angle diffusion up to energies of a few keV. We suggest that ECH waves trap ionospheric electrons in the magnetosphere and accelerate them to produce butterfly pitch angle distributions at energies of up to a few keV. We suggest that ECH waves play a role in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and help provide the source electron population for the radiation belts.",

In the F region ionosphere, electron density is depleted by about 55%. Both the temperature and electron density exhibit global effects in the hours following the eclipse. There are also significant effects on stratosphere-mesosphere chemistry, including an increase in ozone by nearly a factor of 2 at 65 km. Dynamical impacts of the eclipse in the lower atmosphere appear to propagate to the upper atmosphere.

To understand what makes this difference, we studied near-Earth magnetotail conditions at a pseudosubstorm onset and the subsequent substorm onset, using multipoint Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms spacecraft data. In the present event, near-Earth magnetic reconnection possibly occurred before initial brightening for both pseudosubstorm and substorm. In the near-Earth magnetotail at X \u223c- 10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, the ion \u03b2, ion pressure, and ion and total (ion plus magnetic) pressure gradient projection along two closely located spacecraft were smaller and magnetic field lines were less stretched around the pseudosubstorm initial brightening than around the substorm initial brightening. Dipolarization did not occur for the pseudosubstorm, whereas it began just before poleward expansion for the substorm. These observations suggest that conditions of the near-Earth magnetotail possibly affect whether the initial action develops into a full-fledged substorm.",

         "abstract": "Sunspot pairs develop in connection with cell networks at or near the boundaries of positive and negative unipolar magnetic (UM) field regions. In this paper, we confirm his findings by recent data. In this connection, Svalgaard and Wilcox (1976) found also that solar activities occur only at one side of UM boundaries, called the \"Hale boundary,\" on the basis of their observation of the interplanetary magnetic field. It is shown in this paper that the Hale boundary can be recognized also on the photosphere. Further, it is shown that new UM regions grow at the beginning of a new sunspot cycle, and active regions and sunspot pairs tend to develop at or near newly developing Hale boundaries. Thus, it is suggested that UM regions and specifically Hale boundaries are very important for the formation of active regions, sunspots, and sunspot pairs. These facts suggest also that UM regions are not merely remnants of decaying old spots and active regions. Some of the essential features of sunspot pairs, as well as their relationship to the Hale boundary in both even and odd cycles are presented in one figure, illustrating several requirements for a theory of the formation of single spots and sunspot pairs.",

We have found that two types of structured diffuse auroras with obviously different dynamical properties often coexist near MLN. One type usually drifts from low to high latitude with higher speed and shows pulsation. The other type is always adjacent to the discrete aurora oval and drifts together with nearby discrete aurora with much lower speed. Using coordinated observations from MMS and ground all-sky imagers, we found that the two types of diffuse auroras are well correlated with number density increase of O<SUP>+</SUP> (from the ionosphere) and of He<SUP>2+</SUP> (from magnetosheath) ions, respectively. These observations indicate that mangetosheath particles penetrated into the magnetosphere also can play an important role for producing the dayside diffuse aurora. In addition, for the first time, electron cyclotron harmonic waves are observed associated with dayside diffuse aurora.",

Strong semiconcentric GWs were observed and modeled, which couple from their tropospheric sources to the thermosphere, displaying strong nonlinearity indicated by instability, breaking, and formation of turbulent vortices. GWs in the stratosphere display a large range of horizontal scales from 34-400 km; however, the smaller wavelength waves break rapidly in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Larger-scale (\u2265150 km) waves dominate in the thermosphere and display northwestward propagation at 200-300 km altitude, opposing the mean winds. Despite strong molecular viscosity and thermal conductivity in the thermosphere, steepened wave fronts, which may indicate nonlinearity, is identified in 630 nm airglow imagers. The agreement between model and data suggests new opportunities for data-constrained simulations that span multilayer observables, including mesosphere and lower thermosphere-region airglow not captured for this event.",

The CESM2(WACCM6) hindcasts allow for the first comprehensive investigation into the predictability of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) during SSWs. Analysis of 14 major SSWs demonstrates that CESM2(WACCM6) hindcasts initialized \u223c5-15 days prior to the SSW onset are able to predict the timing of the SSW, though they underestimate the strength of the SSW. Aspects of the MLT variability, such as the mesosphere cooling and enhanced semidiurnal tide, are found to be well predicted. The demonstrated ability to predict MLT variability during SSWs indicates the potential for improved multi-day space weather forecasting. Improved space weather forecasting may be achieved by using whole atmosphere models that can predict the MLT variability that drives ionosphere-thermosphere variability during SSWs.",

Uncertainty in transient warming comes from both the uncertainty in each factor and from the warming's sensitivity to uncertainty in each factor. An energy balance model is used to untangle these two components of uncertainty in transient warming, which is shown to be most sensitive to uncertainty in the forcing and not to uncertainty in radiative feedbacks. Additionally, uncertainty in the efficacy of ocean heat uptake is more important than uncertainty in the rate of ocean heat uptake. Three further implications are as follows: (1) transient warming is highly sensitive to uncertainty in emissions, (2) caution is warranted when extrapolating future warming trends from short-lived climate perturbations, and (3) climate models tuned using the historical record are highly sensitive to assumptions made about the historical forcing.",

Although previous studies have mostly agreed on the increase and decrease in the polar cap area during an episode of substorm, there are disparate views on when the polar cap starts to contract relative to substorm onset. Here we address this conflict using high-resolution (~1-3 min) snapshot global auroral images from the ultraviolet imager on board the Polar spacecraft. On the basis of 28 auroral substorm events, all observed in the Northern Hemispheric winter, it is found that the polar cap inflated prior to onset in all events and it attained the largest area ~6 min prior to the substorm expansion phase onset, while the dayside polar cap area remained steady around the onset. The onset of nightside polar cap deflation is found to be attributed to intensifications of aurora on the poleward edge of the nightside oval, mostly in the midnight sector. Although this result supports the loading-unloading and reconnection substorm models, it is not clear if the initial polar cap deflation and the substorm expansion are parts of the same process.",

For many years, this type of signature was anecdotally but widely thought to occur primarily at the poleward edge of the auroral oval. Recent statistical work has found that, on the contrary, for strong solar wind driving, broadband aurora is common throughout the auroral oval. Of particular interest is the occurrence of wave aurora below 68 degrees MLAT. We have studied the dependence of such signatures, both as a function of solar wind driving, and as a function of substorm cycle. A set of about 1800 substorm onsets identified by Polar UVI, along with 116 isolated substorm onsets, were used for superposed epoch analysis. The results show that the wave aurora has a very strong substorm cycle dependence, rising dramatically in the first few minutes after onset, and peaking about 10-15 minutes later. By contrast, wave aurora has no easily identifiable solar wind driving peak, although the general trend is for wave aurora to become more common with higher driving (as do substorms themselves). This evidence adds to previous circumstantial evidence associating wave aurora particularly with substorms (for example, wave auroral power is much more strongly peaked in the premidnight region than is monoenergetic or \u201cinverted-V\u201d aurora).",

Using Cassini measurements, we report a typical event in which four successive dipolarization fronts (DFs) were observed within 1 hour during the substorm in Saturn's magnetotail. The last three DFs caused a type of stepwise electron acceleration and generated energetic electrons. The pitch angle distributions of the electrons show evidence of the Fermi acceleration mechanism behind these DFs. Therefore, we infer the magnetotail dynamics process during Saturn's substorm: The stepwise acceleration by successive DFs powerfully accelerates the field-aligned electrons and generates field-aligned energetic electrons. These high-energy electrons are injected into the inner magnetosphere and become an important trigger of Saturn's aurora. Our results show an efficient acceleration mechanism for the electrons caused by successive DFs and confirm an important source of energetic particles during the substorm in Saturn, and these findings improve our understanding of Saturn's substorm and magnetotail dynamics.",

However, the pathway and entry point of the smoke into the stratosphere and the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here, Lagrangian trajectory analysis is used to examine the flow downstream of the fires in the south Pacific, where the smoke was detected. We find that tropical cyclone Sarai merged with an extratropical cyclone to form a troposphere-wide cyclonic system, with a deep potential vorticity cutoff above it. The smoke first traveled in the isentropic layer between 340 and 350 \u00b0K. Having reached the cyclone, the smoke circulated and entered the stratosphere through a dip in the tropopause height within the cutoff. The cyclone described in this case study is not uncommon in these regions, possibly underlining the importance of this mechanism for troposphere-to-stratosphere exchange.",

         "abstract": "Mercury, a global contaminant, enters the stratosphere through convective uplift, but its chemical cycling in the stratosphere is unknown. We report the first model of stratospheric mercury chemistry based on a novel photosensitized oxidation mechanism. We find two very distinct Hg chemical regimes in the stratosphere: in the upper stratosphere, above the ozone maximum concentration, Hg<SUP>0</SUP> oxidation is initiated by photosensitized reactions, followed by second-step chlorine chemistry. In the lower stratosphere, ground-state Hg<SUP>0</SUP> is oxidized by thermal reactions at much slower rates. This dichotomy arises due to the coincidence of the mercury absorption at 253.7 nm with the ozone Hartley band maximum at 254 nm. We also find that stratospheric Hg oxidation, controlled by chlorine and hydroxyl radicals, is much faster than previously assumed, but moderated by efficient photo-reduction of mercury compounds. Mercury lifetime shows a steep increase from hours in the upper-middle stratosphere to years in the lower stratosphere.",

         "abstract": "Using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms observations from four tail seasons, we study the three-dimensional structure of the dipolarization front current sheet (DFCS), which demarcates the magnetic boundary of a dipolarizing flux bundle (DFB, the strong magnetic field region led by a dipolarization front) in Earth's magnetotail. An equatorial cross section of the DFCS is convex; a meridional cross section is consistent with a dipolarized field line. The equatorial flow pattern in the ambient plasma ahead of the DFCS exhibits diversions of opposite sense on its evening and morning sides. The magnetic field perturbations are consistent with local field-aligned current generation of region-2 sense ahead of the front and region-1 sense at the front. The median thickness of the DFCS increases from 800 to 2000 km with increasing distance from the neutral sheet, indicating bundle compression near the neutral sheet. On a meridional cross section, DFCS's linear current density (1.2-1.8 nA/m) peaks ~\u00b10.55 l from the neutral sheet (where l is the ambient cross-tail current sheet half-thickness, l ~1.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> in our database). This peak, reminiscent of active-time cross-tail current sheet bifurcation noted in past studies, suggests that the intense but thin DFCS (10 to 20 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP>) may be produced by redistribution (diversion) of the extended but weaker cross-tail current (~1 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP>). Near the neutral sheet, the average DFCS current over the dipolarization front (DF) thickness is perpendicular to both the magnetic field interior to the DFB and the average field direction over the DF thickness. Away from the neutral sheet, the average current becomes progressively parallel to the internal field and the average field direction. The average current directions are indicative of region-1-sense field-aligned current on the DF. As few as approximately three DFBs can carry sufficient total current that, if redirected into the auroral ionosphere, can account for the substorm current wedge's peak current for a sizable substorm (~1 MA). A collapsing DFB could thus be an elemental substorm current wedge, or \"wedgelet,\" that can divert a sizable portion of the cross-tail current into the auroral ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "This paper compares results from a whole atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model, GAIA, with the COSMIC and TIMED/SABER observations during the 2008/2009 northern winter season. The GAIA model has assimilated meteorological reanalysis data by a nudging method. The comparison shows general agreement in the major features from the stratosphere to the ionosphere including the growth and decay of the major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event in 2009. During this period, a pronounced semidiurnal variation in the F region electron density and its local-time phase shift similar to the previous observations are reproduced by the model and COSMIC observation. The model suggests that the electron density variation is caused by an enhanced semidiurnal variation in the E \u00d7 B drift, which is probably related to an amplified semidiurnal migrating tide (SW2) in the lower thermosphere. The model and TIMED/SABER observation show that the SW2 tide amplifies at low latitudes from the stratosphere to the thermosphere as well as the phase variation. Possible mechanisms for the SW2 variability in the low latitude stratosphere could be the change of its propagation condition, especially the (2, 2) mode, due to changing zonal background wind and meridional temperature gradient, and/or an enhancement of its source due to redistribution of stratospheric ozone. Present results also show a prominent long-term variation of the terdiurnal migrating component (TW3) in the ionosphere and atmosphere.",

         "abstract": "In common treatment of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at high latitudes, the ionosphere is represented by a thin conducting spherical shell, which closes field-aligned currents generated in the magnetosphere. In this approach, the current continuity yields a Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential associated with the ionospheric convection pattern. Solution of the Poisson equation then provides a means of self-consistently describing magnetospheric and ionospheric plasma convection with a feedback of one on the other. While the high-latitude ionospheric convection is driven by the solar wind and magnetosphere interaction, at lower latitudes atmospheric neutral winds start to dominate. The question that arises then is whether and how midlaltitude and low-latitude ionospheric convection affects high-latitude ionospheric and magnetospheric convection. In global magnetospheric models, ionospheric convection equatorward of the low-latitude boundary is excluded from the simulation domain. However, the boundary condition applied at that boundary to the electrostatic potential may be used as a proxy of this convection. In this paper, we explore effects that different idealized low-latitude boundary conditions have on the magnetospheric configuration simulated by the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global magnetohydrodynamic model. To this end, we perform a number of idealized simulations different only in the low-latitude ionospheric boundary condition used. We find that the behavior of the system can be influenced rather significantly by the different boundary conditions, which is expressed by changes in the evolution of the polar cap potential, global magnetospheric convection, and plasma pressure distribution in the magnetotail and on the dayside. The differences in the cross-polar cap potential can reach up to &gt;10%, dependent on the boundary condition used. In the magnetosphere the low-latitude ionospheric boundary condition affects the strength and location of the plasma outflow from the distant tail x-line and the subsequent earthward convection. Changes in the plasma pressure distribution on the nightside are accompanied by noticeable differences in the shape of the magnetotail. We confirm that the changes in the magnetospheric and ionospheric configuration are not just temporal deviations of the system from the same average dynamical state by considering 1 h averages of the magnetospheric flow and pressure distribution. These results verify that the simulated system reaches similar but distinctly different dynamical states dependent on the low-latitude boundary condition applied.",

         "abstract": "The only previously established seasonal auroral variation is that of intense monoenergetic aurora, corresponding to quasi-static acceleration by geomagnetic-field-aligned electric fields. Here we investigate the separate seasonal dependence of both types of electron accelerated aurora (broadband, or wave, in addition to monoenergetic) and both ion and electron diffuse aurora. Dayside and nightside variations are separately considered, as are conditions of low and high solar wind driving. Across these many combinations, several clear patterns emerge. One is that the dayside tends to maximize precipitation in the summer and much more so for low solar wind driving. Nightside precipitation is higher in the winter and much more so for high solar wind driving. The dayside effects are strongest in number flux and stronger in diffuse aurora than accelerated aurora. The ease of ion entry through the summer cusp, along with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality, and the rise in dayside currents in the summer hemisphere adequately explain much (perhaps all) of the dayside behavior. Nightside effects are more apparent in energy flux, with the winter/summer ratio of monoenergetic aurora being the largest: 1.70 for high solar wind driving. However, both other types of electron aurora, diffuse (1.30) and broadband (1.26), also have winter/summer energy fluxes well above unity for high solar wind driving. The nightside seasonal variation of ions is much smaller, with slightly more energy flux postmidnight in the winter but with slightly higher energy fluxes premidnight in the summer. Since the increased nightside fluxes into the winter hemisphere occur primarily under strong solar wind driving, and are much more prominent in energy flux than number flux, they likely reflect increased energization in the winter ionosphere when stronger currents are being driven into the ionosphere from the magnetosphere. Equinoctial behavior tends to lie between the summer and winter hemisphere values, but typically closer to the latter. As a result, nightside electron energy flux summed over the hemispheres is higher around equinox, simply because there is no summer hemisphere.",

         "abstract": "We report the first in situ observation of high-latitude magnetopause (near the northern duskward cusp) Kelvin-Helmholtz waves (KHW) by Cluster on January 12, 2003, under strongly dawnward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The fluctuations unstable to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) are found to propagate mostly tailward, i.e., along the direction almost 90\u00b0 to both the magnetosheath and geomagnetic fields, which lowers the threshold of the KHI. The magnetic configuration across the boundary layer near the northern duskward cusp region during dawnward IMF is similar to that in the low-latitude boundary layer under northward IMF, in that (1) both magnetosheath and magnetospheric fields across the local boundary layer constitute the lowest magnetic shear and (2) the tailward propagation of the KHW is perpendicular to both fields. Approximately 3-hour-long periods of the KHW during dawnward IMF are followed by the rapid expansion of the dayside magnetosphere associated with the passage of an IMF discontinuity that characterizes an abrupt change in IMF cone angle,\u03d5 = acos&lt;mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\"&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;Bx&lt;mfenced open=\"|\" close=\"|\"&gt;B&lt;/mfenced&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/mfenced&gt;, from \u223c90\u00b0 to \u223c10\u00b0. Cluster, which was on its outbound trajectory, continued observing the boundary waves at the northern evening-side magnetopause during sunward IMF conditions following the passage of the IMF discontinuity. By comparing the signatures of boundary fluctuations before and after the IMF discontinuity, we report that the frequencies of the most unstable KH modes increased after the discontinuity passed. This result demonstrates that differences in IMF orientations (especially in\u03d5) are associated with the properties of KHW at the high-latitude magnetopause due to variations in thickness of the boundary layer, and/or width of the KH-unstable band on the surface of the dayside magnetopause.",

         "abstract": "The magnetospheric mapping of Jupiter's polar auroral emissions is highly uncertain because global Jovian field models are known to be inaccurate beyond \u223c30 R<SUB>J</SUB>. Furthermore, the boundary between open and closed flux in the ionosphere is not well defined because, unlike the Earth, the main auroral oval emissions at Jupiter are likely associated with the breakdown of plasma corotation and not the open/closed flux boundary in the polar cap. We have mapped contours of constant radial distance from the magnetic equator to the ionosphere in order to understand how auroral features relate to magnetospheric sources. Instead of following model field lines, we map equatorial regions to the ionosphere by requiring that the magnetic flux in some specified region at the equator equals the magnetic flux in the area to which it maps in the ionosphere. Equating the fluxes in this way allows us to link a given position in the magnetosphere to a position in the ionosphere. We find that the polar auroral active region maps to field lines beyond the dayside magnetopause that can be interpreted as Jupiter's polar cusp; the swirl region maps to lobe field lines on the night side and can be interpreted as Jupiter's polar cap; the dark region spans both open and closed field lines and must be explained by multiple processes. Additionally, we conclude that the flux through most of the area inside the main oval matches the magnetic flux contained in the magnetotail lobes and is probably open to the solar wind.",

         "abstract": "We statistically examine the occurrence rate of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves observed by Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers/Charge Composition Explorer (AMPTE/CCE). We use the 8 Hz magnetic field data set that covers the whole CCE mission period of nearly 4.5 years from August 1984 to January 1989, which is more than three times the period studied by Anderson et al. [&lt;link href=\"#jgra50385-bib-0005\"/&gt;] (~452 days). The large data volume allows us to evaluate the storm phase dependence of the spatial occurrence pattern of EMIC waves. The major results of this study are summarized as follows. (a) The occurrence rate is below 5% on the nightside at all L. On the dayside, the rate is &lt;5% in the inner magnetosphere (L &lt; 6), while it is higher than 5% in the outer magnetosphere (L \u2265 6), up to 25%. The highest rate appears in the afternoon sector. (b) The overall occurrence rate is higher for H-band events than He-band events, except for the opposite feature seen in the inner magnetosphere on the early afternoon-to-post midnightside (L &lt; 6, 14 h &lt; MLT &lt; 22 h). (c) H-band events occur frequently in the outer magnetosphere (L \u2265 7) in the afternoon sector, regardless of geomagnetic activity. Under quiet conditions, H-band events also occur in the outer magnetosphere on the morningside (4 h \u2264 MLT &lt; 8 h). (d) He-band events frequently occur in the inner magnetosphere (L &lt; 7) on the prenoon to duskside (10 h \u2264 MLT &lt; 19 h) under disturbed conditions (Dst \u2264 -50 nT). (e) The storm time He-band waves are generated more frequently during the main phase than the recovery phase, with the main-phase wave excitation seen toward the afternoonside outer magnetosphere (L &gt; 7). The results indicate two independent major processes that cause EMIC wave excitation in the Earth's magnetosphere: one externally triggers H-band waves on the dayside, and the other internally excites He-band waves on the dusk-to-afternoonside. We suggest that the former is due to solar wind compression which leads to perpendicular adiabatic ion heating and in turn an increase in temperature anisotropy, and that the latter is caused by injections of new, highly energetic ion population from the plasma sheet, with its velocity distributions becoming pancake-like on the dusk-to-afternoonside. The frequent occurrence seen on the afternoonside, at a wide L range, and during the main/development phase, strongly suggests the significant role of the sunward surge of the plasmasphere and plasma plumes in the injection-associated (i.e., storm time) EMIC wave generation.",

         "abstract": "A Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) has been used to explore the possible physical connection between a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) and the dynamics and electrodynamics of the lower thermosphere. WAM produces SSWs naturally without the need for external forcing. The classical signatures of an SSW appear in the model with a warming of the winter polar stratosphere, a reversal of the temperature gradient, and a breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex. Substantial changes in the amplitude of stationary planetary wave numbers 1, 2, and 3 occur as the zonal mean zonal wind evolves. The simulations also show a cooling in the mesosphere and a warming in the lower thermosphere consistent with observations. The magnitude of this particular SSW is modest, belonging to the category of minor warming. In the lower thermosphere the amplitude of diurnal, semidiurnal, and terdiurnal, eastward and westward propagating tidal modes change substantially during the event. Since the magnitude of the warming is minor and the tidal interactions with the mean flow and planetary waves are complex, the one-to-one correspondence between tidal amplitudes in the lower thermosphere and the zonal mean and stationary waves in the stratosphere is not entirely obvious. The increase in the magnitude of the terdiurnal tide (TW3) in the lower thermosphere has the clearest correlation with the SSW, although the timing appears delayed by about three days. The fast group velocity of the long vertical wavelength TW3 tide would suggest a faster onset for the direct propagation of the tide from the lower atmosphere. It is possible that changes in the magnitude of the diurnal and semidiurnal tides, with their slower vertical propagation, may interact in the lower thermosphere to introduce a terdiurnal tide with a longer delay. An increase in TW3 in the lower thermosphere would be expected to alter the local time variation of the electrodynamic response. The day-to-day changes in the lower thermosphere winds from WAM are shown to introduce variability in the magnitude of dayside low latitude electric fields, with a tendency during the warming for the dayside vertical drift to be larger and occur earlier, and for the afternoon minimum to be smaller. The numerical simulations suggest that it is quite feasible that a major SSW, with a magnitude seen in January 2009, could cause large changes in lower thermosphere electrodynamics and hence in total electron content.",

         "abstract": "Statistical results on the global distribution of suprathermal electron (0.1-10 keV) fluxes are shown both outside and inside the plasmasphere separately, using electron data from THEMIS. Significant electron fluxes are found within the plasmasphere, although they are nevertheless smaller than the populations outside the plasmasphere. Electron fluxes outside of the plasmapause increase with stronger magnetic activity on the nightside and decrease as a function of increasing magnetic local time (MLT). Inside the plasmasphere, electron fluxes increase just inside of the plasmapause, particularly from the midnight to the dawn sector during active times, while electron distributions are less MLT-dependent during quiet times. Inside the plasmasphere, electron fluxes are larger and more stable at smaller L shells at higher energy (a few to 10 keV), while electron fluxes decrease at smaller L shells at lower energy (less than a few keV). Our new statistical results on the suprathermal electron distribution both inside and outside the plasmasphere provide essential information for the evaluation of wave propagation characteristics. Case analyses have been performed in order to understand potential mechanisms responsible for electron access into the plasmasphere. The first case analysis shows that during a relatively quiet time following a disturbed interval, deeply injected suprathermal electrons remain trapped at low L shells during the refilling of the plasmasphere and eventually form the plasmaspheric population. The second case analysis suggests that a combination of locally enhanced electric field and subsequent energy-dependent azimuthal magnetic drift may be able to trap the suprathermal electrons inside the plasmasphere during a geomagnetically active period.",

         "abstract": "Mercury's comparatively weak intrinsic magnetic field and its close proximity to the Sun lead to a magnetosphere that undergoes more direct space-weathering interactions than other planets. A unique aspect of Mercury's interaction system arises from the large ratio of the scale of the planet to the scale of the magnetosphere and the presence of a large-size core composed of highly conducting material. Consequently, there is strong feedback between the planetary interior and the magnetosphere, especially under conditions of strong external forcing. Understanding the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere-interior interaction at Mercury requires not only analysis of observations but also a modeling framework that is both comprehensive and inclusive. We have developed a new global MHD model for Mercury in which the planetary interior is modeled as layers of different electrical conductivities that electromagnetically couple to the surrounding plasma environment. This new modeling capability allows us to characterize the dynamical response of Mercury to time-varying external conditions in a self-consistent manner. Comparison of our model results with observations by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft shows that the model provides a reasonably good representation of the global magnetosphere. To demonstrate the capability to model induction effects, we have performed idealized simulations in which Mercury's magnetosphere is impacted by a solar wind pressure enhancement. Our results show that due to the induction effect, Mercury's core exerts strong global influences on the way Mercury responds to changes in the external environment, including modifying the global magnetospheric structure and affecting the extent to which the solar wind directly impacts the surface. The global MHD model presented here represents a crucial step toward establishing a modeling framework that enables self-consistent characterization of Mercury's tightly coupled planetary interior-magnetosphere system.",

         "abstract": "Numerous observations and model studies made during the past 5 years have unequivocally revealed that the ionosphere and thermosphere owe a considerable amount of their longitudinal, local time, seasonal latitudinal and day-to-day variability to waves originating in the lower part of the atmosphere. The most prominent pattern is the four-peaked (\u201cwave 4\u201d) longitudinal structure frequently observed by (quasi-) Sun-synchronous satellites in a variety of ionospheric and thermospheric parameters. The \u201cwave 4\u201d has often been attributed to the diurnal, eastward, wave number 3 (DE3), nonmigrating tide alone. A more detailed analysis of TIMED observations, supported by physics-based empirical modeling and data from the CHAMP satellite, now indicates that this interpretation needs to be revised. Secondary wave generation due the nonlinear interaction between the migrating diurnal tide and the DE3 leads to a large stationary planetary wave 4 (SPW4) and a large semidiurnal, eastward wave number 2 (SE2) tide in the equatorial zonal wind at E-region heights. Combined amplitudes can equal those of the DE3. SE2 penetrates into the upper thermosphere with transequatorial wind speeds in excess of 10 m/s. This paper discusses the resulting implications for electric field generation in the E-region and tidal-ionosphere coupling in the F-region and provides observational constraints for future modeling efforts.",

         "abstract": "We investigate the solar wind interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere by using a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation driven by an idealized time-varying solar wind input that includes features of Corotating Interaction Regions typically seen at Saturn. Our model results indicate that the compressibility of Saturn's magnetosphere is intermediate between the Earth's and Jupiter's, and the magnetopause location appears insensitive to the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field. The modeled dependences of both the magnetopause and bow shock locations on the solar wind dynamic pressure agree reasonably well with those of data-based empirical models. Our model shows that the centrifugal acceleration of mass-loaded flux tubes leads to reconnection on closed field lines forming plasmoids, an intrinsic process (\u201cVasyli\u016bnas-cycle\u201d) in Saturn's magnetosphere taking place independent of the external conditions. In addition, another type of reconnection process involving open flux tubes (\u201cDungey-cycle\u201d) is also seen in our simulation when the external condition is favorable for dayside reconnection. Under such circumstances, plasmoid formation in the tail involves reconnection between open field lines in the lobes, producing stronger global impacts on the magnetosphere and ionosphere compared to that imposed by the Vasyli\u016bnas-cycle directly. Our model also shows that large-scale tail reconnection may be induced by compressions driven by interplanetary shocks. In our simulation, large-scale tail reconnection and plasmoid formation take place in a quasi-periodic manner but the recurrence rate tends to be higher as the dynamic pressure becomes higher. While large-scale plasmoid release clearly is an important process in controlling the magnetospheric dynamics, it appears insufficient to account for all the losses of plasma added by the magnetospheric sources. We find that a large fraction of the planetary plasma is lost through the magnetotail near the flanks probably through relatively small-scale plasmoids, a situation that may also exist at Jupiter.",

         "abstract": "A major challenge in delineating and understanding the \u201cspace weather\u201d of the ionosphere-thermosphere system is the lack of global tidal observations in the 120-400 km \u201cthermospheric gap\u201d between satellite remote-sensing and in-situ tidal diagnostics. This paper aims to close this gap by presenting an observation-based Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT) of self-consistent upward propagating migrating and nonmigrating diurnal and semidiurnal tides from 80-400 km and pole-to-pole for moderate (F10.7 = 110 sfu) solar flux conditions. CTMT includes the 6 (8) most important diurnal (semidiurnal) tidal components for temperature, density, and zonal, meridional and vertical winds and is based on Hough Mode Extension fits to 2002-2008 mean TIMED satellite tidal diagnostics in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT). Validation with independent 2002-2008 CHAMP tidal diagnostics (F10.7 = 105 sfu) around 400 km proves that the approach captures nonmigrating tides well, indicating that these waves propagate directly upward without significant tidal forcing occurring in the thermosphere. Notable exceptions are the DW2 and D0 components that are most likely generated in-situ by nonlinear interaction forcing in the upper thermosphere. CTMT is suitable for driving upper atmosphere models that require self-consistent tidal fields in the MLT region as a lower boundary condition. It does not include migrating tides due to in-situ EUV absorption in the upper thermosphere but allows us to quantitatively assess thermospheric variability due to tides from the lower atmosphere. This is done by discussing longitude/latitude maps of reconstructed diurnal and semidiurnal tidal variations as function of altitude and local time.",

         "abstract": "Discrete aurora at Mars, characterized by their small spatial scale and tendency to form near strong crustal magnetic fields, are emissions produced by particle precipitation into the Martian upper atmosphere. Since 2014, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN's (MAVEN's) Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) has obtained a large collection of UV discrete aurora observations during its routine periapsis nightside limb scans. Initial analysis of these observations has shown that, near the strongest crustal magnetic fields in the southern hemisphere, the IUVS discrete aurora detection frequency is highly sensitive to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle. However, the role of other solar wind properties in controlling the discrete aurora detection frequency has not yet been determined. In this work, we use the IUVS discrete aurora observations, along with MAVEN observations of the upstream solar wind, to determine how the discrete aurora detection frequency varies with solar wind dynamic pressure, IMF strength, and IMF cone angle. We find that, outside of the strong crustal field region (SCFR) in the southern hemisphere, the aurora detection frequency is relatively insensitive to the IMF orientation, but significantly increases with solar wind dynamic pressure, and moderately increases with IMF strength. Interestingly however, although high solar wind dynamic pressures cause more aurora to form, they have little impact on the brightness of the auroral emissions. Alternatively, inside the SCFR, the detection frequency is only moderately dependent on the solar wind dynamic pressure, and is much more sensitive to the IMF clock and cone angles. In the SCFR, aurora are unlikely to occur when the IMF points near the radial or anti-radial directions when the cone angle (arccos(B<SUB>x</SUB>/|B|)) is less than 30\u00b0 or between 120\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. Together, these results provide the first comprehensive characterization of how upstream solar wind conditions affect the formation of discrete aurora at Mars.",

         "abstract": "A generalization of the traditional 12-station auroral electrojet (AE) index to include more than 100 magnetometer stations, SME, is an excellent predictor of global auroral power (AP), even at high cadence (1 min). We use this index, and a database of more than 53,000 substorms derived from it, covering 1980-2009, to investigate time and energy scales in the magnetosphere, during substorms and otherwise. We find, contrary to common opinion, that substorms do not have a preferred recurrence rate but instead have two distinct dynamic regimes, each following a power law. The number of substorms recurring after a time \u0394t, N(\u0394t), varies as \u0394t<SUP>-1.19</SUP> for short times (&lt;80 min) and as \u0394t<SUP>-1.76</SUP> for longer times (&gt;3 hours). Other evidence also shows these distinct regimes for the magnetosphere, including a break in the power law spectra for SME at about 3 hours. The time between two consecutive substorms is only weakly correlated (r = 0.18 for isolated and r = 0.06 for recurrent) with the time until the next, suggesting quasiperiodicity is not common. However, substorms do have a preferred size, with the typical peak SME magnitude reaching 400-600 nT, but with a mean of 656 nT, corresponding to a bit less than 40 GW AP. More surprisingly, another characteristic scale exists in the magnetosphere, namely, a peak in the SME distribution around 61 nT, corresponding to about 5 GW precipitating AP. The dominant form of auroral precipitation is diffuse aurora; thus, these values are properties of the magnetotail thermal electron distribution. The characteristic 5 GW value specifically represents a preferred minimum below which the magnetotail rarely drops. The magnetotail experiences continuous loss by precipitation, so the existence of a preferred minimum implies driving that rarely disappears altogether. Finally, the distribution of SME values across all times, in accordance with earlier work on AE, is best fit by the sum of two distributions, each normal in log(SME). The lower distribution (with a 40% weighting) corresponds to the characteristic quiet peak, while the higher value distribution (60% weighting) is an average over the characteristic substorm peak and the subsequent prolonged recovery.",

         "abstract": "In this paper we describe a coupled model of Earth's magnetosphere that consists of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation, the MIX ionosphere solver and the Rice Convection Model (RCM) and report some results using idealized inputs and model parameters. The algorithmic and physical components of the model are described, including the transfer of magnetic field information and plasma boundary conditions to the RCM and the return of ring current plasma properties to the LFM. Crucial aspects of the coupling include the restriction of RCM to regions where field-line averaged plasma-\u03b2 \u2264 1, the use of a plasmasphere model, and the MIX ionosphere model. Compared to stand-alone MHD, the coupled model produces a substantial increase in ring current pressure and reduction of the magnetic field near the Earth. In the ionosphere, stronger region-1 and region-2 Birkeland currents are seen in the coupled model but with no significant change in the cross polar cap potential drop, while the region-2 currents shielded the low-latitude convection potential. In addition, oscillations in the magnetic field are produced at geosynchronous orbit with the coupled code. The diagnostics of entropy and mass content indicate that these oscillations are associated with low-entropy flow channels moving in from the tail and may be related to bursty bulk flows and bubbles seen in observations. As with most complex numerical models, there is the ongoing challenge of untangling numerical artifacts and physics, and we find that while there is still much room for improvement, the results presented here are encouraging.",

         "abstract": "Numerical simulations are performed for a sudden stratosphere warming (SSW) under different atmospheric tide and planetary wave forcing conditions to investigate the tidal variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The influence of variability of different tides in the MLT on generating perturbations to the low latitude ionosphere is also investigated. Significant changes are found to occur in the migrating semidiurnal solar (SW2) and lunar (M2) tides as well as in the westward propagating nonmigrating semidiurnal tide with zonal wave number 1 (SW1). The changes in the zonal mean atmosphere that occur during SSWs lead to an enhancement in the SW2 and M2 tides. The vertical wavelength of the SW2 is also changed, resulting in phase variability in the SW2 at a constant altitude. Significant enhancements in the SW1 are found to occur only in the presence of additional planetary wave forcing, and this demonstrates that nonlinear planetary wave\u2212tide interactions lead to the enhanced SW1 during SSWs. The amplitude and phase variability of the SW2 is found to be capable of producing temporal variability in the vertical plasma drift velocity that is similar to the observed variability. Changes in the M2 during SSWs can contribute up to an additional \u223c30% of the total ionosphere variability; however, the overall influence of the lunar tide is found to be dependent upon the phase of the moon relative to the timing of the SSW. Although the influence is relatively minor, the SW1 also contributes to the low latitude ionosphere variability during SSWs. The simulation results for the vertical plasma drift velocity and total electron content (TEC) further illustrate that significant longitude variability occurs in the ionosphere response to SSWs.",

         "abstract": "The magnetosheath operates as a natural filter between the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma. As a result of this, the magnetosheath plays a crucial role in the plasma momentum and energy transport from the interplanetary medium into the magnetosphere. Statistical studies of the magnetosheath are difficult due to the dynamic nature of the terrestrial bow shock and the magnetopause. As a result of this, the spatial and temporal dependence of magnetosheath plasma properties under varying solar wind conditions is still not completely understood. We present a study of magnetosheath plasma properties using 5 years of THEMIS and OMNI data to produce statistical maps of fundamental magnetosheath plasma properties. The magnetosheath interplanetary medium reference frame is applied to present data in a normalized reference frame which accounts for both boundary and orbital motion. The statistical maps are compared with the MHD runs from the CCMC-BATS-R-US model which agree favorably. The results are also used to investigate the presence of any magnetosheath plasma parameter asymmetries and their possible causes.",

         "abstract": "This paper introduces a new Earth's atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model that treats seamlessly the neutral atmospheric region from the troposphere to the thermosphere as well as the thermosphere-ionosphere interaction including the electrodynamics self-consistently. The model is especially useful for the study of vertical connection between the meteorological phenomena and the upper atmospheric behaviors. As an initial simulation using the coupled model, we have carried out a 30 day consecutive run in September. The result reveals that the longitudinal structure of the F-region ionosphere varies on a day-to-day basis in a highly complex way and that a four-peak structure of the daytime equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) similar to the recent observations appears as an averaged feature. The simulation reproduces and thus confirms the vertical coupling processes proposed so far with respect to the formation of the averaged EIA longitudinal structure; the excitation of solar nonmigrating tides in the troposphere, their propagation through the middle atmosphere, and the modulation of ionospheric dynamo, which in turn affects EIA generation. The simulation result indicates that not only the ionospheric averaged longitudinal structure but also the day-to-day variation can be modulated significantly by the lower atmospheric effect.",

         "abstract": "A number of recent studies have highlighted the observational evidence for a coupling between atmospheric tides in the thermosphere and the electron density structure of the ionosphere. The most commonly proposed mechanism to explain this is an electrodynamic coupling between tides at E region altitudes and ion drifts at F region altitudes. However, based on both the observational evidence from recent satellite missions such as those of the neutral winds associated with nonmigrating tides at F region altitudes, and considering the theoretical effects of atmospheric tides on the thermosphere and ionosphere, more than one coupling mechanism must be considered. We use Sami2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere to test a set of electrodynamic and chemical-dynamical coupling mechanisms that could explain the link between tides in the thermosphere and the low-latitude ionosphere. We investigate the possible role of the vertical drifts during the both the day and around sunset, perturbations to the thermospheric neutral density and thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], and tidal winds at F region altitudes. These simulations give an estimate of the sensitivity of the nighttime ionosphere to each of these coupling mechanisms. We then compare the results of these sensitivity tests with the effects of atmospheric tides on different thermospheric parameters as simulated by a self-consistent model of the atmosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamic system (thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model). This comparison shows that in addition to the E region dynamo modulation, the potential coupling between tides and the ionosphere via changes in thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], meridional winds at F region altitudes, and modification of the vertical drifts around sunset could play an important role and all require further study, both with models and new observations.",

         "abstract": "Energetic particle transport into the inner magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms is responsible for significant plasma pressure enhancement, which is the driver of large-scale currents that control the global electrodynamics within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Therefore, understanding the transport of plasma from the tail deep into the near-Earth magnetosphere, as well as the energization processes associated with this transport, is essential for a comprehensive knowledge of the near-Earth space environment. During the main phase of a geomagnetic storm on 17 March 2013 (minimum Dst ~ -137 nT), the Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment (RBSPICE) instrument on the Van Allen Probes observed frequent, small-scale proton injections deep into the inner nightside magnetosphere in the region L ~ 4 - 6. Although isolated injections have been previously reported inside geosynchronous orbit, the large number of small-scale injections observed in this event suggests that, during geomagnetic storms injections provide a robust mechanism for transporting energetic ions deep into the inner magnetosphere. In order to understand the role that these injections play in the ring current dynamics, we determine the following properties for each injection: (i) associated pressure enhancement, (ii) the time duration of this enhancement, and (iii) the lowest and highest energy channels exhibiting a sharp increase in their intensities. Based on these properties, we estimate the effect of these small-scale injections on the pressure buildup during the storm. We find that this mode of transport could make a substantial contribution to the total energy gain in the storm time inner magnetosphere.",

The amplitudes of small-scale perturbations with apparent wavelengths between 100 and 500 km in the Ar density around the exobase show a clear dependence on temperature (T<SUB>0</SUB>) of the upper thermosphere. The average amplitude of the perturbations is 10% on the dayside and 20% on the nightside, which is about 2 and 10 times larger than those observed in the Venusian upper thermosphere and in the low-latitude region of Earth's upper thermosphere, respectively. The amplitudes are inversely proportional to T<SUB>0</SUB>, suggesting saturation due to convective instability in the Martian upper thermosphere. After removing the dependence on T<SUB>0</SUB>, dependences of the average amplitude on the geographic latitude and longitude and solar wind parameters are found to be not larger than a few percent. These results suggest that the amplitudes of small-scale perturbations are mainly determined by convective breaking/saturation in the upper thermosphere on Mars, unlike those on Venus and Earth.",

         "abstract": "Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) simulations are used to investigate solar and lunar tide changes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) that occur in response to sudden stratosphere warmings (SSWs). The average tidal response is demonstrated based on 23 moderate to strong Northern Hemisphere SSWs. The migrating semidiurnal lunar tide is enhanced globally during SSWs, with the largest enhancements (\u223c60-70%) occurring at mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Enhancements in the migrating solar semidiurnal tide (SW2) also occur up to an altitude of 120 km. Above this altitude, the SW2 decreases in response to SSWs. The SW2 enhancements are 40-50%, making them smaller in a relative sense than the enhancements in the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide. Changes in nonmigrating solar tides are, on average, generally small and the only nonmigrating tides that exhibit changes greater than 20% are the diurnal tide with zonal wave number 0 (D0) and the westward propagating semidiurnal tide with zonal wave number 1 (SW1). D0 is decreased by \u223c20-30% at low latitudes, while SW1 exhibits a similar magnitude enhancement at mid to high latitudes in both hemispheres. The tidal changes are attributed to a combination of changes in the zonal mean zonal winds, changes in ozone forcing of the SW2, and nonlinear planetary wave-tide interactions. We further investigate the influence of the lunar tide enhancements on generating perturbations in the low latitude ionosphere during SSWs by using the WACCM-X thermosphere to drive an ionosphere-electrodynamics model. For both solar maximum and solar minimum simulations, the changes in the equatorial vertical plasma drift velocity are similar to observations when the lunar tide is included in the simulations. However, when the lunar tide is removed from the simulations, the low latitude ionosphere response to SSWs is unclear and the characteristic behavior of the low latitude ionosphere perturbations that is seen in observations is no longer apparent. Our results thus indicate the importance of variability in the lunar tide during SSWs, especially for the coupling between SSWs and perturbations in the low latitude ionosphere.",

We find that both brightness and aurora morphology undergo systematic variations correlated to the periodically changing plasma environment. The time variable morphology seems to be strongly affected by Europa's interaction with the magnetospheric plasma. The brightest emissions are often found in the polar region where the ambient Jovian magnetic field line is normal to Europa's disk. Near the equator, where bright spots are found at Io, Europa's aurora is faint suggesting a general difference in how the plasma interaction shapes the aurora at Io and Europa. The dusk side is consistently brighter than the dawnside with only few exceptions, which cannot be readily explained by obvious plasma physical or known atmospheric effects. Brightness ratios of the near-surface OI] 1356 \u0160to OI 1304 \u0160emissions between 1.5 and 2.8 with a mean ratio of 2.0 are measured, confirming that Europa's bound atmosphere is dominated by O<SUB>2</SUB>. The 1356/1304 ratio decreases with increasing altitude in agreement with a more extended atomic O corona, but O<SUB>2</SUB> prevails at least up to altitudes of \u223c900 km. Differing 1356/1304 line ratios on the plasma upstream and downstream hemispheres are explained by a differing O mixing ratio in the near-surface O<SUB>2</SUB> atmosphere of \u223c5% (upstream) and \u22721% (downstream), respectively. During several eclipse observations, the aurora does not reveal any signs of systematic changes compared to the sunlit images suggesting no or only weak influence of sunlight on the aurora and an optically thin atmosphere.",

         "abstract": "We investigate whether induction within Callisto's electrically conductive ionosphere can explain observed magnetic fields which have previously been interpreted as evidence of induction in a saline, electrically conductive subsurface ocean. Callisto's ionosphere is subject to the flow of time-periodic magnetized plasma of Jupiter's magnetosphere, which induces electric fields and electric currents in Callisto's electrically conductive ionosphere. We develop a simple analytic model for a first quantitative understanding of the effects of induction in Callisto's ionosphere caused by the interaction with a time-variable magnetic field environment. With this model, we also investigate how the associated ionospheric currents close in the ambient magnetospheric plasma. Based on our model, we find that the anisotropic nature of Callisto's ionospheric conductivity generates an enhancement effect on ionospheric loop currents which are driven by the time-variable magnetic field. This effect is similar to the Cowling channel effect known from Earth's ionosphere. Subsequently, we numerically calculate the expected induced magnetic fields due to Jupiter's time-variable magnetic field in an anisotropic conductive ionosphere and compare our results with the Galileo C-3 and C-9 flybys. We find that induction within Callisto's ionosphere is responsible for a significant part of the observed magnetic fields. Ionospheric induction creates induced magnetic fields to some extent similar as expected from a subsurface water ocean. Depending on currently unknown properties such as Callisto's nightside ionosphere, the existence of layers of \"dirty ice\" and the details of the plasma interaction, a water ocean might be located much deeper than previously thought or might not exist at all.",

         "abstract": "In the last decade a significant discovery has been made in the heliosphere: the spectrum of particles accelerated in both the inner heliosphere and in the heliosheath is the same: a power law in particle speed with a spectral index of -5, when the spectrum is expressed as a distribution function; or equivalently, a differential intensity spectrum that is a power law in energy with a spectral index of -1.5. In the inner heliosphere this common spectrum occurs at quite low energies and is most evident in instruments designed to measure suprathermal particles. In the heliosheath, the common spectrum is observed over the full energy range of the Voyager energetic particle instruments, up to energies of ~100 MeV. The remarkable discovery of a common spectrum is compounded by the realization that no traditional acceleration mechanism, i.e., diffusive shock acceleration or stochastic acceleration, can account for the common spectrum. There is thus an opportunity to once again demonstrate the relevance of heliospheric physics by developing a new acceleration mechanism that yields the common spectrum, with the expectation that such a new acceleration mechanism will find broader applications in astrophysics. In this paper, the observations of the common spectrum in the heliosphere are summarized, with emphasis on those that best reveal the conditions in which the acceleration must operate. Then, building on earlier work, a complete derivation is presented of an acceleration mechanism, a pump acceleration mechanism, that yields the common spectrum, and the various subtleties associated with this derivation are discussed.",

         "abstract": "This study investigates the lunar plasma environment when embedded within Earth's magnetotail. We use data from 10 years of tail crossings by the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. We separate the plasma environments by magnetosheath-like, magnetotail lobe-like, and plasma sheet-like conditions. Our findings highlight that the lobe-like plasma is associated with low densities and a strong magnetic field, while the plasma sheet is characterized by higher densities and a weaker magnetic field. These regions are flanked by the fast, predominantly tailward flows of the terrestrial magnetosheath. During a single lunar crossing, however, the magnetotail displays a wide range of variability, with transient features\u2014including reconnection events\u2014intermixed between periods of lobe-like or sheet-like conditions. We compare and contrast the Moon's local magnetotail plasma to the environments near various outer-planet moons. In doing so, we find that properties of the ambient lunar plasma are, at times, unique to the terrestrial magnetotail, while at others, may resemble those near the Jovian, Saturnian, and Neptunian moons. These findings highlight the complementary role of the ARTEMIS mission in providing a deeper understanding of the plasma interactions of the outer-planet moons.",

         "abstract": "Steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events in the Earth's magnetosphere are thought to result from balancing the rate of opening flux through solar wind-magnetosphere reconnection at the dayside magnetopause to the rate of closing flux through reconnection in the magnetotail. For this to occur, reconnected flux in the tail must return to the dayside to balance the dayside reconnection rate. Using Geotail and THEMIS data over a span of 14 years, we examine the average plasma conditions and fast Earthward flows during SMC intervals and compare them to other types of geomagnetic activity, such as quiet intervals, isolated substorm phases, and the two hours before an SMC (Pre-SMC intervals). We show that the average total pressure in the inner magnetosphere is higher during SMC events than for other types of activity. This higher pressure region extends to larger radial distances, and causes fast Earthward flows to divert toward the dawn or dusk flanks and continue to the dayside. This pattern is contrasted to substorms, during which flows are directed toward the inner magnetosphere and flux remains there in the \u201cpile-up region.\u201d We suggest that the SMC pattern of flow deflection carries enough flux from the tail to the dayside to allow for balanced reconnection. Finally, the Pre-SMC intervals have plasma conditions that are similar to, but slightly weaker than, SMC events. Since most SMCs begin with a substorm, this indicates that preconditioning of the magnetosphere by prior geomagnetic activity is important in setting up the magnetotail for an SMC state.",

         "abstract": "We used the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global magnetohydrodynamics model to study the effects of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>y</SUB> component on the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere-ionosphere system. When the IMF reconnects with the terrestrial magnetic field with IMF B<SUB>y</SUB>\u22600, flux transport is asymmetrically distributed between the two hemispheres. We describe how B<SUB>y</SUB> is induced in the closed magnetosphere on both the dayside and nightside and present the governing equations. The magnetosphere imposes asymmetric forces on the ionosphere, and the effects on the ionospheric flow are characterized by distorted convection cell patterns, often referred to as \"banana\" and \"orange\" cell patterns. The flux asymmetrically added to the lobes results in a nonuniform induced B<SUB>y</SUB> in the closed magnetosphere. By including the dynamics of the system, we introduce a mechanism that predicts asymmetric Birkeland currents at conjugate foot points. Asymmetric Birkeland currents are created as a consequence of y directed tension contained in the return flow. Associated with these currents, we expect fast localized ionospheric azimuthal flows present in one hemisphere but not necessarily in the other. We also present current density measurements from Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment that are consistent with this picture. We argue that the induced B<SUB>y</SUB> produces asymmetrical Birkeland currents as a consequence of asymmetric stress balance between the hemispheres. Such an asymmetry will also lead to asymmetrical foot points and asymmetries in the azimuthal flow in the ionosphere. These phenomena should therefore be treated in a unified way.",

         "abstract": "The Geotail spacecraft made in situ observations of magnetic reconnection on 15 May 2003 in the near-Earth magnetotail at a radial distance of 28 R<SUB>E</SUB> when a moderate substorm started on the ground. For this event, the intense cross-tail electron current layer was detected in association with the simultaneous plasma flow and magnetic field reversals, and the scale length along the GSM x axis was obtained. This observation enables us to deduce scales for the basic structure of magnetic reconnection in the near-Earth magnetotail. In the center of the electron current layer (a possible X line), the speed of the dawnward electron flow carrying cross-tail current exceeds the maximum of the electron outflow speed (earthward/tailward), and it is highly super Alfv\u00e9nic. The full extent of this central intense cross-tail electron current layer is approximately 1 \u03bbi (ion inertial length) in the x direction, which corresponds to 0.2 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the magnetotail. Electron outflow speed reaches its maximum, which is also super Alfv\u00e9nic, at distances of less than 1 \u03bbi from the X line, and ion outflow speed reaches its maximum farther away from the center. Electron outflow speed decreases in the downstream region, and it becomes the same as the ion speed at distances of 4 \u03bbi. The full extent of the ion-electron decoupling region is 8 \u03bbi in the x direction, which corresponds to 1.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the magnetotail, and the outer region belongs to the MHD regime. Inside the ion-electron decoupling region, ions are accelerated up to 10 keV during inflow processes and further accelerated beyond 40 keV toward the duskward direction near the center and along the x axis slightly away from the center. These observations of the ion and electron dynamics in the close vicinity of the X line are fairly consistent with results from the two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation described here and others. The present Geotail results provide the observational basis for the structure of magnetic reconnection in the near-Earth magnetotail.",

         "abstract": "Solar flare enhancements to the soft X-ray (XUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral irradiance depend on the location of the flare on the solar disk. Most emission lines in the XUV region (\u223c0.1 to \u223c25 nm) are optically thin and are weakly dependent on the location of the flare, but in the EUV region (\u223c25 to \u223c120 nm), many important lines and continua are optically thick, so enhancements are relatively smaller for flares located near the solar limb, due to absorption by the solar atmosphere. The flare irradiance spectral model (FISM) was used to illustrate these location effects, assuming two X17 flares that are identical except that one occurs near disk center and the other near the limb. FISM spectra of these two flares were used as solar input to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) to investigate the ionosphere/thermosphere (I/T) response. Model simulations showed that in the E region ionosphere, where XUV dominates ionization, flare location does not affect I/T response. However, flare-driven changes in the F region ionosphere, total electron content (TEC), and neutral density in the upper thermosphere, are 2-3 times stronger for a disk-center flare than for a limb flare, due to the importance of EUV enhancement. Flare location did not affect the timing of the ionospheric response, but the thermospheric response was \u223c20 min faster for the disk-center flare. Model simulations of I/T responses to an X17 flare on 28 October 2003 were consistent with measurements of TEC and neutral density changes.",

         "abstract": "This paper addresses the question of the contribution of azimuthally localized flow channels and magnetic field dipolarizations embedded in them in the global dipolarization of the inner magnetosphere during substorms. We employ the high-resolution Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global magnetosphere magnetohydrodynamic model and simulate an isolated substorm event, which was observed by the geostationary satellites and by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. The results of our simulations reveal that plasma sheet flow channels (bursty bulk flows, BBFs) and elementary dipolarizations (dipolarization fronts, DFs) occur in the growth phase of the substorm but are rare and do not penetrate to the geosynchronous orbit. The substorm onset is characterized by an abrupt increase in the occurrence and intensity of BBFs/DFs, which penetrate well earthward of the geosynchronous orbit during the expansion phase. These azimuthally localized structures are solely responsible for the global (in terms of the magnetic local time) dipolarization of the inner magnetosphere toward the end of the substorm expansion. Comparison with the geostationary satellites and Magnetospheric Multiscale data shows that the properties of the BBFs/DFs in the simulation are similar to those observed, which gives credence to the above results. Additionally, the simulation reveals many previously observed signatures of BBFs and DFs, including overshoots and oscillations around their equilibrium position, strong rebounds and vortical tailward flows, and the corresponding plasma sheet expansion and thinning.",

         "abstract": "We introduce a new model to study Jupiter's magnetosphere and how it interacts with the solar wind. We first derive a set of one-fluid MHD equations to consistently include the ion-neutral collisions in Jupiter's ionosphere and the mass loading in the Io torus. The mass loading and the subsequent radial mass transport in Jupiter's magnetosphere leads to a deviation from full corotation of the magnetospheric plasma. Ion-neutral collisions in Jupiter's ionosphere and subsequent transport of angular momentum out into the magnetosphere acts to spin up the magnetosphere's plasma. Our model explicitly includes mass loading in the Io plasma torus and an inner boundary region, which represents the effects of Jupiter's ionosphere. We present the results of five model runs where different mass loading rates and ionospheric conductances are used. For these model runs, we consider an antiparallel interplanetary magnetic field and a strong solar wind dynamic pressure, resulting in a compressed magnetosphere. The results are compared with analytical models, in situ measurements, and remote-sensing observations. Our azimuthal velocity profiles and the position of the corotation breakdown are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions by Hill (1979, 2001) and Saur et al., (2004a), and Voyager observations. The total current flowing into and out of the ionosphere is 48.7 MA, which is in agreement with estimates from measurements and analytical models. Using the field aligned electric current j<SUB>\u2225</SUB> to determine the position of the aurorae, we find that our main auroral oval is associated, as expected, with the position of the corotation breakdown (between 20.6 R<SUB>J</SUB> and 30.1 R<SUB>J</SUB> for the different model runs). The discontinuity in the main oval observed by Radioti et al. (2008) is also present in our results, where it is caused by an asymmetry in the pressure distribution, due to the interaction between the rotating plasma and the magnetopause.",

         "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the ionosphere is an important source of ions in the magnetosphere and until recently this population has largely been neglected from many global simulations. In this study, a causally regulated cusp O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow is added to the multifluid version of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global simulation. The cusp outflow algorithm uses empirical relationships to regulate the outflow flux with further conditioning to isolate the outflow spatially to a dynamic cusp. The impact cusp O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow has on the magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) system is investigated for a moderate storm on 31 August 2005. It is found the MI system response depends upon the specification of the outflow velocity and temperature. More energetic outflow tends to flow downtail whilst colder, slower outflow fills the inner magnetosphere. High O<SUP>+</SUP> densities in the inner magnetosphere can increase the strength of the ring current, reducing Dst and inflating the magnetosphere. This effect is mostly found for the less energetic outflow specification. O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow is found to reduce the access of solar wind ions to the inner magnetosphere, which, through the MI coupling in LFM reduces the precipitating electron power, conductance and field-aligned currents. The effect outflow has on the cross polar cap potential (CPCP) depends upon two competing factors. The reduction in Region I currents when outflow is present appears to increase the CPCP whilst the inflation of the magnetosphere due to an enhanced ring current decreases the CPCP.",

         "abstract": "Recent THEMIS spacecraft observations have shown longitudinally narrow, earthward moving, plasma sheet flow channels with large, abrupt magnetic field dipolarizations that have been referred to as dipolarization fronts. We undertake a detailed study of the subset of these events that had good quality auroral imaging. We find that many occurred during the substorm expansion phase after onset (determined by auroral intensification) and were related to auroral streamers. Both the fronts' relation to streamers and their plasma sheet changes are similar to what has been previously shown for other plasma sheet flow channels and to other flow channels seen during the expansion phases of the events considered here. Surprisingly, the dipolarization fronts examined made major contributions to substorm onset ground and space magnetic signatures. These include substorm near-Earth dipolarization, which indicates that the current wedge may develop via a series of well-defined, narrow, post-onset wedge-like structures. These also include the auroral zone ground magnetic field, which showed only modest responses to the onsets but abrupt, large responses to post-onset dipolarization-front-related streamers, and midlatitude positive bays, which started near the time of streamer formation. Our observations suggest that traditional magnetic signatures of substorm onset, such as near-Earth dipolarization, auroral-zone negative bays, and midlatitude positive bays, may misidentify the expansion phase onset determined by auroral intensification by up to 10s of minutes for some events. It should be interesting in the future to determine the generality of the above relations between dipolarization front signatures and onset signatures.",

         "abstract": "This paper presents results from a simulation study exploring heliospheric consequences of time-dependent changes at the Sun. We selected a 2 month period in the beginning of year 2008 that was characterized by very low solar activity. The heliosphere in the equatorial region was dominated by two coronal holes whose changing structure created temporal variations distorting the classical steady state picture of the heliosphere. We used the Air Force Data Assimilate Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) model to obtain daily updated photospheric magnetograms and drive the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model of the corona. This leads to a formulation of a time-dependent boundary condition for our three-dimensional (3-D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, LFM-helio, which is the heliospheric adaptation of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry MHD simulation code. The time-dependent coronal conditions were propagated throughout the inner heliosphere, and the simulation results were compared with the spacecraft located near 1 astronomical unit (AU) heliocentric distance: Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A and STEREO-B), and the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft that was in cruise phase measuring the heliospheric magnetic field between 0.35 and 0.6 AU. In addition, during the selected interval MESSENGER and ACE aligned radially allowing minimization of the effects of temporal variation at the Sun versus radial evolution of structures. Our simulations show that time-dependent simulationsreproduce the gross-scale structure of the heliosphere with higher fidelity, while on smaller spatial and faster time scales (e.g., 1 day) they provide important insights for interpretation of the data. The simulations suggest that moving boundaries of slow-fast wind transitions at 0.1 AU may result in the formation of inverted magnetic fields near pseudostreamers which is an intrinsically time-dependent process. Finally, we show that heliospheric current sheet corrugation, which may result in multiple sector boundary crossings when observed by spacecraft, is caused by solar wind velocity shears. Overall, our simulations demonstrate that time-dependent heliosphere modeling is a promising direction of research both for space weather applications and fundamental physics of the heliosphere.",

         "abstract": "An extensive analysis of Cassini Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) and Charge Energy Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) measurements of ~6-231 keV ion anisotropies acquired during selected spin and stare periods for nearly all mission orbits has been completed. Based on this analysis, we find that the computed azimuthal speed of Saturn's magnetodisk plasma increases within the inner and middle magnetosphere. Beyond the orbit of Titan, in the magnetotail, the calculated rotation speed remains roughly constant with increasing distance from Saturn. The component of convection parallel to Saturn's spin axis is smaller and on average nearly zero. The radial speed of plasma shows distinct local time dependence and increases outward with increasing distance down the magnetotail. The magnetodisk flow remains primarily azimuthal to large distances, indicating the plasma is still under the influence of Saturn as it transits across the nightside. Tailward flows have been observed in the region near the dawn and dusk magnetotail flanks. The plasma flow in the predawn quadrant is much more disorganized than that in the premidnight quadrant. The hydrogen and oxygen hot ion temperatures increase with decreasing distance to Saturn. Some plasma evidently escapes into a dusk boundary layer at the dusk magnetotail flank, while the remaining plasma primarily moves across the magnetotail and is entrained into the flow of a boundary layer at the dawn flank of the magnetotail. When scaled to the magnetopause standoff distance and corotation fraction, the convection speed of plasma in the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn is similarly organized.",

         "abstract": "We compared the global plasmaspheric total electron content (pTEC) with the ionospheric TEC (iTEC) simultaneously measured by Jason-1 satellite during the declining phase of solar cycle 23 (2002-2009) to investigate the global morphology of the plasmaspheric density in relation to the ionosphere. Our study showed that the plasmaspheric density structures fundamentally follow the ionosphere, but there are also significant differences between them. Although the diurnal variations are very similar to each region, the plasmasphere shows much weaker variations, only approximately 1 TECU day-night difference. By analyzing the day-night differences in the plasmasphere, we found that the plasmaspheric contribution to the nighttime ionosphere does not increase with solar activity and the largest contribution occurs during June solstice. The plasmasphere shows similar seasonal variations to the ionosphere, except for the semiannual variation, which is essentially absent in the plasmasphere. There is also an important difference in the annual variation: although the annual variation in the ionosphere exists regardless of longitude, it occurs only at American sector in the plasmasphere. As solar activity increases to moderate level, the pTEC substantially enhances from approximately 2 to 4 TECU at the initial increase of solar activity below F10.7p = 100 and then quickly slows down while the iTEC almost linearly enhances. Although it is well known that magnetic storms are the major source of plasmaspheric density depletion, pTEC does not show this aspect of the plasmasphere probably due to the relatively small K<SUB>p</SUB> values for high magnetic activity (K<SUB>p</SUB> &gt; 2.5) in the current study.",

         "abstract": "The substorm mechanism is investigated by analyzing the numerical results obtained through the use of the recently refined magnetohydrodynamic model. After showing the growth phase features, the numerical solution reproduces the observed signatures of a substorm onset, including the formation of a near-Earth neutral line (NENL), earthward directed flow in the plasma sheet, a dipolarization, a geosynchronous D deflection, the development of the nightside field aligned currents (FACs), and electrojets in the ionosphere. The onset is triggered by a sudden collapse of the plasma sheet and a successive formation of a high-pressure region in the inner magnetosphere. The energy source of this high-pressure region is the magnetic tension released from the NENL. The tail disturbance is primary transmitted to the ionosphere by the region 2 FAC accompanying the high-pressure region formed in the inner magnetosphere. The associated nightside region 1 FAC is not connected to the traditional current wedge but to the cusp region. The region 1 FAC path to the ionosphere develops from dayside to nightside, so as to construct a grand loop with the region 2 FAC from the partial ring current. In the grand loop, the region 1 FAC provides a short circuit in the ionosphere for the region 2 FAC. In the expansion phase, convection enhances to relax the distorted pressure distribution formed at the onset, accompanied by a further development of dipolarization and a thickening of the plasma sheet in the magnetosphere and increases in the westward and eastward electrojets in the ionosphere. The present model can explain the explosive growth phase and the thinning of the midtail plasma sheet just after the onset.",

We compare R against the composite sunspot group data from the Royal Greenwich Observatory network and the Solar Optical Observing Network, using both the number of sunspot groups, N<SUB>G</SUB>, and the total area of the sunspots, A<SUB>G</SUB>. In addition, we compare R with the recently developed interdiurnal variability geomagnetic indices IDV and IDV(1d). In all four cases, linearity of the relationship with R is not assumed and care is taken to ensure that the relationship of each with R is the same before and after the putative calibration change. It is shown the probability that a correction is not needed is of order 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and that R is indeed too low before 1945. The optimum correction to R for values before 1945 is found to be 11.6%, 11.7%, 10.3%, and 7.9% using A<SUB>G</SUB>, N<SUB>G</SUB>, IDV, and IDV(1d), respectively. The optimum value obtained by combining the sunspot group data is 11.6% with an uncertainty range 8.1-14.8% at the 2\u03c3 level. The geomagnetic indices provide an independent yet less stringent test but do give values that fall within the 2\u03c3 uncertainty band with optimum values are slightly lower than from the sunspot group data. The probability of the correction needed being as large as 20%, as advocated by Svalgaard (2011), is shown to be 1.6 \u00d7 10<SUP>-5</SUP>.",

         "abstract": "We present observations of proton aurora at Mars made using the Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) onboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft. Martian proton aurora display a prominent intensity enhancement in the hydrogen Lyman-alpha (121.6 nm) emission between ~110 and 150 km altitude. Using altitude-intensity profiles from periapsis limb scan data spanning nearly two Martian years, we create a comprehensive database of proton aurora and characterize their phenomenology. Due to Mars' lack of a global dipole magnetic field, Martian proton aurora are expected to form on the dayside via electron stripping and charge exchange between solar wind protons and the neutral corona. We observe proton aurora in ~14% of dayside periapsis profiles (with notable seasonal variability), making proton aurora the most commonly observed type of aurora at Mars. We determine that the primary factors influencing proton aurora occurrence rates are solar zenith angle and season. The highest proton aurora occurrence rates are at low solar zenith angles on the Mars dayside, consistent with known formation processes. Proton aurora have highest emission enhancements, peak intensities, peak altitudes, and occurrence rates (nearing 100%) around southern summer solstice. This time period corresponds with the seasonal inflation of the neutral lower atmosphere, the onset of Martian dust storm season, seasonally increased coronal hydrogen column densities, and higher atmospheric temperature and solar wind flux following perihelion. The results of our study provide a new understanding of the primary factors influencing proton aurora, and the long-term variability of these phenomena as observed over multiple Mars years.",

         "abstract": "to its importance for global energy dissipation in the ionosphere, the diffuse aurora has been intensively studied in the past 40 years. Its origin (precipitation of 0.5-10 keV electrons from the plasma sheet without potential acceleration) has been generally attributed to whistler-mode chorus wave scattering in the inner magnetosphere (R &lt; ~8 R<SUB>E</SUB>), while the scattering mechanism beyond that distance remains unresolved. By modeling the quasi-linear diffusion of electrons with realistic parameters for the magnetic field, loss cone size, and wave intensity (obtained from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) observations as a function of magnetospheric location), we estimate the loss cone filling ratio and electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) wave-induced electron precipitation systematically throughout the entire data set, from 6 R<SUB>E</SUB> out to 31 R<SUB>E</SUB> (the THEMIS apogee). By comparing the wave-induced precipitation directly with the equatorially mapped energy flux distribution of the diffuse aurora from ionospheric observations (OVATION Prime model) at low altitudes, we quantify the contribution of auroral energy flux precipitated due to ECH wave scattering. Although the wave amplitudes decrease, as expected, with distance from the Earth, due to the smaller loss cone size and stretched magnetic field topology, ECH waves are still capable of causing sufficient scattering of plasma sheet electrons to account for the observed diffuse auroral dissipation. Our results demonstrate that ECH waves are the dominant driver of the diffuse aurora in the outer magnetosphere, beyond ~8 R<SUB>E</SUB>.",

The Lunar Environment Heliospheric X-ray Imager and Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer missions are scheduled to image the Earth's dayside magnetosphere system in soft X-rays to investigate global-scale magnetopause reconnection modes under varying solar wind conditions. The exospheric neutral hydrogen density distribution, especially the value of this density at the subsolar magnetopause is of particular interest for understanding X-ray emissions near this boundary. This paper estimates the exospheric density during solar minimum using the X-ray Multimirror Mission (XMM) astrophysics observatory. We selected an event on 12 November 2008 from the XMM data archive, which detects soft X-rays of magnetosheath origin while solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions are relatively constant. During the event the location of the magnetopause was measured in situ by the THEMIS mission, thus the location of the solar wind ions responsible for the magnetosheath emission is well constrained by observation. We estimated the exospheric density using the Open Geospace Global Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) and a spherically symmetric exosphere model. The ratio of the magnetosheath plasma flux between the OpenGGCM model and the THEMIS, was nearly 1, which means the magnetohydrodynamic model reasonably reproduces the magnetosheath plasma conditions. The OpenGGCM magnetosheath parameters were used to deconvolve soft X-rays of exospheric origin from the XMM signal. The lower-limit of the exospheric density of this solar minimum event is 36.8 \u00b1 11.7 cm<SUP>\u22123</SUP> at 10 R<SUB>E</SUB> subsolar location.",

         "abstract": "A combination of statistical studies and 18 case studies have been used to investigate the structure of the induced Martian magnetosphere. The different plasma and magnetic pressure forces on the dayside of the induced magnetosphere of Mars have been studied using 3.5 years of Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) and Mars Express (MEX) observations. We present estimates of typical values for the dominant pressure terms, that is, the thermal pressures of the ionosphere and the magnetosheath, the magnetic pressure of the magnetic pile-up region, and the solar wind dynamic pressure. For 18 typical orbits the altitudes and relative distances of the pressure balance boundaries, the photoelectron boundary, the ion composition boundary, and the induced magnetosphere boundary are estimated. The magnetic pile-up boundary is discussed but not further studied since earlier characterizations of the magnetic pile-up boundary do not agree with our results. This study focuses on the transition region between the ionosphere and the magnetosheath on the dayside of Mars. We show that earlier definitions of the photoelectron boundary, ion composition boundary, and induced magnetosphere boundary do not characterize the transition region well, mainly because each boundary is based on measurements from only one or two instruments. In order to characterize the transition region correctly, changes in magnetic field strength and fluctuations, dominant ion species, electron and ion densities and energy distributions need to be considered. This article confirms a complex interaction between Mars and the solar wind and can explain why previous studies have had difficulties to describe the force balance.",

We demonstrate that the structure of FACs formed during the expansion phase and associated with the substorm current wedge is significantly more complex than a simple equivalent line current model comprising a downward FAC in the east and upward FAC in the west. This two-dimensional view demonstrates that azimuthal bands of upward and downward FACs with periodic structuring in latitude form across midnight and can span up to 8 h of magnetic local time. However, when averaged over latitude, the overall longitudinal structure of the net FACs resembles the simpler equivalent line current description of the substorm current wedge (SCW). In addition, we demonstrate that the upward FAC elements of the structured SCW are spatially very well correlated with discrete aurora during the substorm expansion phase and that discrete changes in the FAC topology are observed in the late growth phase prior to auroral substorm expansion phase onset. These observations have important implications for determining how the magnetosphere and ionosphere couple during the late growth phase and expansion phase, as well as providing important constraints on the magnetospheric generator of the FACs comprising the SCW.",

We find that the azimuthal current intensity, and thus the stretching of the magnetic field lines, is dependent on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, i.e., the ionospheric Pedersen conductivity and iogenic plasma mass outflow rate. Overall, however, the equatorial magnetic field profiles obtained are similar in the inner region to those used previously, such that the currents are of the same order as previous solutions obtained using a fixed empirical equatorial field strength model, although the outer fringing field of the current disc acts to reverse the field-aligned current in the outer region. We also find that while the azimuthal current in the inner region is dominated by hot plasma pressure, as is generally held to be the case for Jupiter, the use of a realistic plasma angular velocity profile actually results in the centrifugal current becoming dominant in the outer magnetosphere. In addition, despite the dependence of the intensity of the azimuthal current on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, the location of the peak field-aligned current in the equatorial plane also varies, such that the ionospheric location remains roughly constant. It is thus found that significant changes to the mass density of the iogenic plasma disc are required to explain the variation in the main oval location observed using the Hubble Space Telescope.",

The SW2 and M<SUB>2</SUB> amplitudes reach \u223c50 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> and \u223c40 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively, in zonal wind at E region altitudes. The dramatic increase in the M<SUB>2</SUB> at these altitudes influences the dynamo generation of electric fields, and the importance of the M<SUB>2</SUB> on the ionosphere variability during the 2009 SSW is demonstrated by comparing simulations with and without the M<SUB>2</SUB>. TIME-GCM simulations that incorporate the M<SUB>2</SUB> are found to be in good agreement with Jicamarca Incoherent Scatter Radar vertical plasma drifts and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations of the maximum F region electron density. The agreement with observations is worse if the M<SUB>2</SUB> is not included in the simulation, demonstrating that the lunar tide is an important contributor to the ionosphere variability during the 2009 SSW. We additionally investigate sources of the F region electron density variability during the SSW. The primary driver of the electron density variability is changes in electric fields. Changes in meridional neutral winds and thermosphere composition are found to also contribute to the electron density variability during the 2009 SSW. The electron density variability for the 2009 SSW is therefore not solely due to variability in electric fields as previously thought.",

         "abstract": "The LEXI and SMILE missions will provide soft X ray images of the Earth's magnetosheath and cusps after their anticipated launch in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The IBEX mission showed the potential of an Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) instrument to image dayside magnetosheath and cusps, albeit over the long hours required to raster an image with a single pixel imager. Thus, it is timely to discuss the two imaging techniques and relevant science topics. We simulate soft X ray and low ENA images that might be observed by a virtual spacecraft during two interesting solar wind scenarios: a southward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field and a sudden enhancement of the solar wind dynamic pressure. We employ the OpenGGCM global magnetohydrodynamics model and a simple exospheric neutral density model for these calculations. Both the magnetosheath and the cusps generate strong soft X rays and ENA signals that can be used to extract the locations and motions of the bow shock and magnetopause. Magnetopause erosion corresponds closely to the enhancement of dayside reconnection rate obtained from the OpenGGCM model, indicating that images can be used to understand global scale magnetopause reconnection. When dayside imagers are installed with high ENA inner magnetosphere and FUV/UV aurora imagers, we can trace the solar wind energy flow from the bow shock to the magnetosphere and then to the ionosphere in a self standing manner without relying upon other observatories. Soft X ray and/or ENA imagers can also unveil the dayside exosphere density structure and its response to space weather.",

         "abstract": "In recent years there have been a series of reported ground- and satellite-based observations of lunar tide signatures in the equatorial and low latitude ionosphere/thermosphere around sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events. This lower atmosphere/ionosphere coupling has been suggested to be via the E region dynamo. In this work we present the results of analyzing 6 years of hourly upper mesospheric winds from specular meteor radars over a midlatitude (54\u00b0N) station and a high latitude (69\u00b0N) station. Instead of correlating our results with typical definitions of SSWs, we use the definition of polar vortex weaking (PVW) used by Zhang and Forbes. This definition provides a better representation of the strength in middle atmospheric dynamics that should be responsible for the waves propagating to the E region. We have performed a wave decomposition on hourly wind data in 21 day segments, shifted by 1 day. In addition to the radar wind data, the analysis has been applied to simulations from Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Extended version and the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model. Our results indicate that the semidiurnal lunar tide (M<SUB>2</SUB>) enhances in northern hemispheric winter months, over both middle and high latitudes. The time and magnitude of M<SUB>2</SUB> are highly correlated with the time and associated zonal wind of PVW. At middle/high latitudes, M<SUB>2</SUB> in the upper mesosphere occurs after/before the PVW. At both latitudes, the maximum amplitude of M<SUB>2</SUB> is directly proportional to the strength of PVW westward wind. We have found that M<SUB>2</SUB> amplitudes could be comparable to semidiurnal solar tide amplitudes, particularly around PVW and equinoxes. Besides these general results, we have also found peculiarities in some events, particularly at high latitudes. These peculiarities point to the need of considering the longitudinal features of the polar stratosphere and the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere regions. For example, during SSW 2009, we found that M<SUB>2</SUB> enhances many days before PVW which is not in agreement with most of our results.",

Earthward fast flows can thus be used as a proxy for energy and momentum transfer into the closed magnetosphere during the course of a substorm. Characteristics of flows observed before substorm onset can provide information on the role of the flows in substorm onset triggering as well as the sequence of substorm-related processes. We use 15 years of data obtained by Geotail, Cluster, and THEMIS to study statistically the distribution of earthward plasma sheet flows during substorms. Substorm phases are determined from time series of the AL index and the z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field. We find that the occurrence frequency of medium-speed (100 km/s &lt; V &lt; 500 km/s) flows increases slightly toward the end of the substorm growth phase. At substorm onset there is a sharp increase of medium-speed flows, and during substorm recovery there is a gradual decrease of such flows. The occurrence frequency of high-speed (V &gt; 500 km/s) flows, on the other hand, does not clearly increase during the substorm growth phase. The increase at substorm onset is more gradual than for the medium-speed flows. The occurrence frequency of high-speed flows peaks at the beginning of substorm recovery. These results indicate that any effect of the flows on substorm onset triggering would be caused by medium rather than very high speed flows.",

         "abstract": "The large-scale dynamic behavior of Mercury's highly compressed magnetosphere is predominantly powered by magnetic reconnection, which transfers energy and momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. The contribution of flux transfer events (FTEs) at the dayside magnetopause to the redistribution of magnetic flux in Mercury's magnetosphere is assessed with magnetic field data acquired in orbit about Mercury by the Magnetometer on the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. FTEs with core fields greater than the planetary field just inside the magnetopause are prevalent at Mercury. Fifty-eight such large-amplitude FTEs were identified during February and May 2012, when MESSENGER sampled the subsolar magnetosheath. The orientation of each FTE was determined by minimum variance analysis, and the magnetic flux content of each was estimated using a force-free flux rope model. The average flux content of the FTEs was 0.06 MWb, and their durations imply a transient increase in the cross-polar cap potential of ~25 kV. For a substorm timescale of 2-3 min, as indicated by magnetotail flux loading and unloading, the FTE repetition rate (10 s) and average flux content (assumed to be 0.03 MWb) imply that FTEs contribute at least ~30% of the flux transport required to drive the Mercury substorm cycle. At Earth, in contrast, FTEs are estimated to contribute less than 2% of the substorm flux transport. This result implies that whereas at Earth, at which steady-state dayside reconnection is prevalent, multiple X-line dayside reconnection and associated FTEs at Mercury are a dominant forcing for magnetospheric dynamics.",

         "abstract": "Auroral substorms are often associated with optical ray or bead structures during initial brightening (substorm auroral onset waves). Occurrence probabilities and properties of substorm onset waves have been characterized using 112 substorm events identified in Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imager data and compared to Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E) and kinetic instability properties. All substorm onsets were found to be associated with optical waves, and thus, optical waves are a common feature of substorm onset. Eastward propagating wave events are more frequent than westward propagating wave events and tend to occur during lower-latitude substorms (stronger solar wind driving). The wave propagation directions are organized by orientation of initial brightening arcs. We also identified notable differences in wave propagation speed, wavelength (wave number), period, and duration between westward and eastward propagating waves. In contrast, the wave growth rate does not depend on the propagation direction or substorm strength but is inversely proportional to the wave duration. This suggests that the waves evolve to poleward expansion at a certain intensity threshold and that the wave properties do not directly relate to substorm strengths. However, waves are still important for mediating the transition between the substorm growth phase and poleward expansion. The relation to arc orientation can be explained by magnetotail structures in the RCM-E, indicating that substorm onset location relative to the pressure peak determines the wave propagation direction. The measured wave properties agree well with kinetic ballooning interchange instability, while cross-field current instability and electromagnetic ion cyclotron instability give much larger propagation speed and smaller wave period.",

         "abstract": "The ability to perform data assimilation in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended version (WACCMX) is implemented using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results are presented demonstrating that WACCMX+DART analysis fields reproduce the middle and upper atmosphere variability during the 2009 major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. Compared to specified dynamics WACCMX, which constrains the meteorology by nudging toward an external reanalysis, the large-scale dynamical variability of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere is improved in WACCMX+DART. This leads to WACCMX+DART better representing the downward transport of chemical species from the mesosphere into the stratosphere following the SSW. WACCMX+DART also reproduces most aspects of the observed variability in ionosphere total electron content and equatorial vertical plasma drift during the SSW. Hindcast experiments initialized on 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 January are used to assess the middle and upper atmosphere predictability in WACCMX+DART. A SSW, along with the associated middle and upper atmosphere variability, is initially predicted in the hindcast initialized on 15 January, which is \u223c10 days prior to the warming. However, it is not until the hindcast initialized on 20 January that a major SSW is forecast to occur. The hindcast experiments reveal that dominant features of the total electron content can be forecasted \u223c10-20 days in advance. This demonstrates that whole atmosphere models that properly account for variability in lower atmosphere forcing can potentially extend the ionosphere-thermosphere forecast range.",

Model simulations and data analysis were conducted for two flares of similar magnitude (X6.2 and X5.4) that had the same location on the solar limb, but the X6.2 flare had longer rise and decay times. Simulated total electron content (TEC) enhancements from the X6.2 and X5.4 flares were \u223c6 total electron content units (TECU) and \u223c2 TECU, and the simulated neutral density enhancements were \u223c15%-20% and \u223c5%, respectively, in reasonable agreement with observations. Additional model simulations showed that for idealized flares with the same magnitude and location, the thermosphere and ionosphere responses changed significantly as a function of rise and decay rates. The \"Neupert Effect,\" which predicts that a faster flare rise rate leads to a larger EUV enhancement during the impulsive phase, caused a larger maximum ion production enhancement. In addition, model simulations showed that increased E \u00d7 B plasma transport due to conductivity increases during the flares caused a significant equatorial anomaly feature in the electron density enhancement in the F region but a relatively weaker equatorial anomaly feature in TEC enhancement, owing to dominant contributions by photochemical production and loss processes. The latitude dependence of the thermosphere response correlated well with the solar zenith angle effect, whereas the latitude dependence of the ionosphere response was more complex, owing to plasma transport and the winter anomaly.",

         "abstract": "The influence of the solar wind on Jupiter's magnetosphere is studied via three-dimensional global MHD simulations. We especially examine how solar wind density variations affect the main auroral emission. Our simulations show that a density increase in the solar wind has strong effects on the Jovian magnetosphere: the size of the magnetosphere decreases, the field lines are compressed on the dayside and elongated on the nightside (this effect can be seen even deep inside the magnetosphere), and dawn-dusk asymmetries are enhanced. Our results also show that the main oval becomes brighter when the solar wind is denser. But the precise response of the main oval to such a density enhancement in the solar wind depends on the local time: on the nightside the main oval becomes brighter, while on the dayside it first turns slightly darker for a few hours and then also becomes brighter. Once the density increase in the solar wind reaches the magnetosphere, the magnetopause moves inward, and in less than 5 h, a new approximate equilibrium position is obtained. But the magnetosphere as a whole needs much longer to adapt to the new solar wind conditions. For instance, the total electrical current closing in the ionosphere slowly increases during the simulation and it takes about 60 h to reach a new equilibrium. By then the currents have increased by as much as 45%.",

         "abstract": "By performing a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation, we have demonstrated for the first time that an electrojet at the dayside magnetic equator can be reversed and an overshielding condition can be established in the inner magnetosphere after substorm onset without northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field. Near the substorm onset, the plasma pressure is highly enhanced in the inner magnetosphere on the nightside. The Region 2 field-aligned current diverges from the diamagnetic current on the surface of the dayside extension of the high-pressure region, which is connected to the ionosphere in the relatively low-conductivity region a few degrees equatorward of the main auroral oval that is formed as the projection of the plasma sheet. The separation of the equatorward boundary of the auroral region and the equatorward boundary of the Region 2 current results in dusk-dawn electric fields that generate a counter electrojet (CEJ) at the dayside magnetic equator. Poleward electric fields in a narrow latitudinal width, which may be regarded as subauroral ion drift and subauroral polarization stream, are simultaneously intensified. The dusk-dawn electric fields may propagate to the inner magnetosphere along a field line as shear Alfv\u00e9n waves. Then, the inner magnetosphere is completely constrained by the overshielding condition. The intensity and polarity of the CEJ depend largely on at least the ionospheric conductivity that is related to the plasma pressure (probably associated with diffuse aurora). This may explain the observational fact that overshielding does not always occur after onset.",

         "abstract": "Substorms release a large amount of energy, some of which is used to energize the precipitating particles in the polar region. Superposed epoch analysis was performed with 11 years of DMSP SSJ/4/5 data to characterize the substorm cycle of the diffuse, monoenergetic, and broadband/wave precipitating electrons and precipitating ions. Although substorms only increase the ion pressure by 30%, they increase the power of the diffuse, monoenergetic, and wave electron aurora by 310%, 71%, and 170%, respectively. Substorms energize the ion aurora mainly in the 21:00-05:00 magnetic local time (MLT) sector. The dynamics of the diffuse electron aurora are different from those of the other two electron aurorae. The expansion phase duration is approximately 15 min for the monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae, whereas it is 1 h for the diffuse electron aurora. The monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae appear to complete the substorm cycle within a 5 h interval, whereas the diffuse electron aurora takes more than 5 h. The diffuse electron aurora power and energy flux start increasing at 15 min before the substorm onset, whereas those for the monoenergetic and wave electron aurorae start increasing at 1 h and 15 min before the onset. The increase in the monoenergetic electron aurora power and energy flux may result from the increase in the magnetotail stretching and region-1 field-aligned current during the growth phase. The monoenergetic electrons may also be associated with fast flows, which have been previously observed more frequently in the dusk-midnight sector.",

         "abstract": "We investigate localized magnetosheath and solar wind density enhancements, associated with clear magnetic field changes, and therefore referred to as magnetosheath/solar wind plasmoids, respectively. Using Cluster data, we show that there are two distinct populations of magnetosheath plasmoids, one associated with a decrease of magnetic field strength (diamagnetic plasmoids), and one with an increased magnetic field strength (paramagnetic plasmoids). The diamagnetic magnetosheath plasmoids have scale sizes of the order of 1-10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, while the paramagnetic ones are an order of magnitude smaller. The diamagnetic plasmoids are not associated with any change in the magnetosheath plasma flow velocity, and they are classified as embedded plasmoids in the terminology of Karlsson et al. (2012). The paramagnetic plasmoids may either be embedded or associated with increases in flow velocity (fast plasmoids). A search for plasmoids in the pristine solar wind resulted in identification of 62 diamagnetic plasmoids with very similar properties to the magnetosheath diamagnetic plasmoids, making it probable that the solar wind is the source of these structures. No paramagnetic plasmoids are found in the pristine solar wind, indicating that these are instead created at the bow shock or in the magnetosheath. We discuss the relation of the plasmoids to the phenomenon of magnetosheath jets, with which they have many properties in common, and suggest that the paramagnetic plasmoids can be regarded as a subset of these or a closely related phenomenon. We also discuss how the results from this study relate to theories addressing the formation of magnetosheath jets.",

         "abstract": "We analyze an isolated substorm on 29 March 2009 observed by the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and well monitored by ground-based observatories at and near station Gillam. The event provides a rare opportunity for monitoring the substorm magnetic topology thanks to fortuitous clustering of the THEMIS probes, complemented by the GOES 12 spacecraft. The neutral sheet position was found to be displaced by \u223c0.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> northward from its average location. The peak cross-tail current density was estimated to be \u223c20 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP> at the end of the growth phase, revealing the formation of a thin current sheet during the last 15 min prior to the expansion onset. The fortuitous spacecraft conjunction allowed us to construct an adjusted time-varying model based on magnetic field and pressure observations during the substorm. We then used the adjusted model to map the location of the spacecraft to the ionosphere and the breakup from the ionosphere to the equatorial region. Significant time-dependent differences between this and the standard models (e.g., T96) do exist, resulting in breakup mapping to \u223c22 R<SUB>E</SUB>, compared to 12 R<SUB>E</SUB> if classical models are used. Moreover, we find that spacecraft footprints in the ionosphere move significantly equatorward (2\u00b0) over tens of minutes during the growth phase but jump poleward (2\u00b0-4\u00b0) after expansion onset. Since such motions are also typical for auroral arcs during substorms, we infer that magnetic field reconfiguration during various substorm phases, rather than plasma motion in the equatorial magnetosphere, is largely responsible for the observed motion of the aurora.",

         "abstract": "works have emphasized the significant influence of the solar wind Alfv\u00e9n Mach number (M<SUB>A</SUB>) on magnetospheric dynamics. Here we report statistical, observational results that pertain to changes in the magnetosheath flow distribution and magnetopause shape as a function of solar wind M<SUB>A</SUB> and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle orientation. We use all Cluster 1 data in the magnetosheath during the period 2001-2010, using an appropriate spatial superposition procedure, to produce magnetosheath flow distributions as a function of location in the magnetosheath relative to the IMF and other parameters. The results demonstrate that enhanced flows in the magnetosheath are expected at locations quasi-perpendicular to the IMF direction in the plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line; in other words, for the special case of a northward IMF, enhanced flows are observed on the dawn and dusk flanks of the magnetosphere, while much lower flows are observed above the poles. The largest flows are adjacent to the magnetopause. Using appropriate magnetopause crossing lists (for both high and low M<SUB>A</SUB>), we also investigate the changes in magnetopause shape as a function of solar wind M<SUB>A</SUB> and IMF orientation. Comparing observed magnetopause crossings with predicted positions from an axisymmetric semi-empirical model, we statistically show that the magnetopause is generally circular during high M<SUB>A</SUB>, while is it elongated (albeit with moderate statistical significance) along the direction of the IMF during low M<SUB>A</SUB>. These findings are consistent with enhanced magnetic forces that prevail in the magnetosheath during low M<SUB>A</SUB>. The component of the magnetic forces parallel to the magnetopause produces the enhanced flows along and adjacent to the magnetopause, while the component normal to the magnetopause exerts an asymmetric pressure on the magnetopause that deforms it into an elongated shape.",

         "abstract": "Observational properties of throat aurora are investigated in detail by using 7 year continuous auroral observations obtained at Yellow River Station (magnetic latitude 76.24\u00b0N). From our inspection, throat aurora is often observed under the condition of stripy diffuse aurora contacting with the persistent discrete auroral oval, and the long-period throat aurora observations generally consist of intermittent subsequences of throat aurora brightening followed by poleward moving auroral form and throat aurora dimming. We also noticed that the orientation of throat aurora is aligned along the ionospheric convection flow, and its local time distribution shows clear dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>y</SUB> component. These observational results indicate that factors inside the magnetosphere may play important role on occurrence of throat aurora. We thus suggest that throat aurora may present the ionospheric signature of redistribution of reconnection rate on the magnetopause by cold magnetospheric plasma flowing into the reconnection site. In addition, we also found that the occurrence rate of throat aurora clearly decreases with increase of the IMF cone angle (arccos(|B<SUB>x</SUB>|/B)), which is very similar with the occurrence rate of high-speed jet (HSJ) observed in magnetosheath depending on the IMF cone angle. This is suggested as that the HSJs occurred outside the magnetosphere may also play important role for generation of throat aurora by triggering magnetopause reconnection or by direct impacting. Although further studies are needed to clarify how the throat auroras are generated in detail, the relevant observations about throat aurora have presented important implications on a variety open questions, such as distribution and generation of cold plasma structures in the outer magnetosphere, magnetopause deformation, and possible relation between HSJ and reconnection.",

         "abstract": "We present a detailed analysis of the large-scale current systems and their effects on the ground magnetic field disturbance for an idealized substorm event simulated with the equilibrium version of the Rice Convection Model. The objective of this study is to evaluate how well the bubble-injection picture can account for some classic features of the substorm expansion phase. The entropy depletion inside the bubble is intentionally designed to be so severe that it can penetrate deep into geosynchronous orbit. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Both the region-1-sense and region-2-sense field-aligned currents (FACs) intensify substantially. The former resembles the substorm current wedge and flows along the eastern and western edges of the bubble. The latter is connected to the enhanced partial ring current in the magnetosphere associated with a dipolarization front earthward of the bubble. In the ionosphere, these two pairs of FACs are mostly interconnected via Pedersen currents. (2) The horizontal ionospheric currents show a significant westward electrojet peaked at the equatorward edge of the footprint of the bubble. The estimated ground magnetic disturbance is consistent with the typical features at various locations relative to the center of the westward electrojet. (3) A prominent Harang-reversal-like boundary is seen in both ground \u0394H disturbance and plasma flow pattern, appearing in the westward portion of the equatorward edge of the bubble footprint, with a latitudinal extent of \u223c5\u00b0 and a longitudinal extent of the half width of the bubble. (4) The dramatic dipolarization inside the bubble causes the ionospheric map of the inner plasma sheet to exhibit a bulge-like structure, which may be related to auroral poleward expansion. (5) The remarkable appearance of the westward electrojet, Harang-reversal-like boundary and poleward expansion starts when the bubble reaches the magnetic transition region from tail-like to dipole-like configuration. We also estimate the horizontal and vertical currents using magnetograms at tens of ground stations for a deep injection substorm event occurred on April 9, 2008, resulting in a picture that is qualitatively consistent with the simulation. Based on the simulations and the observations, an overall picture of the ionospheric dynamics and its magnetospheric drivers during deep bubble injections is obtained.",

         "abstract": "In order to study the dynamical role of gravity waves (GWs) propagating upward from the lower atmosphere to the thermosphere, numerical simulation using a high-resolution general circulation model that contains the region from the ground surface to the exobase (about 500 km height) has been performed. Our results indicate that the zonal momentum drag due to breaking/dissipation of GWs (GW drag) plays an important role not only in the mesosphere but also in the thermosphere. In particular, the GW drag at high latitudes in the150-250 km height region exceeds 200 ms<SUP>-1</SUP> (d)<SUP>-1</SUP> and is important for the zonal momentum balance. The semidiurnal variation of the GW drag is dominant in the 100-200 km height region, while the diurnal variation of the GW drag prevails above a height of 200 km. The GW drag in the thermosphere is mainly directed against the background zonal wind, indicating the filtering effect by the background wind. A global view of the GW activity in the middle and upper atmosphere is also investigated. The global distribution of the GW activity in the thermosphere is not uniform, and there are some enhanced regions of the GW activity. The GW activity in the thermosphere is stronger in high latitudes than in low latitudes. The GW activity in the winter thermosphere is influenced by the mesospheric jet and the planetary wave activity in the mesosphere.",

We investigate the oxygen-to-hydrogen ratio in the near-Earth magnetosphere from -10 R<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; X<SUB>GSE</SUB> &lt; 10 R<SUB>E</SUB>. The results are based on seven years of ion flux measurements in the energy range \u223c10 keV to \u223c955 keV from the RAPID and CIS instruments on board the Cluster satellites. We find that (1) hydrogen ions at \u223c10 keV show only a slight correlation with the geomagnetic conditions and interplanetary magnetic field changes. They are best correlated with the solar wind dynamic pressure and density, which is an expected effect of the magnetospheric compression; (2) \u223c10 keV O<SUP>+</SUP> ion intensities are more strongly affected during disturbed phase of a geomagnetic storm or substorm than &gt;274 keV O<SUP>+</SUP> ion intensities, relative to the corresponding hydrogen intensities; (3) In contrast to \u223c10 keV ions, the &gt;274 keV O<SUP>+</SUP>ions show the strongest acceleration during growth phase and not during the expansion phase itself. This suggests a connection between the energy input to the magnetosphere and the effective energization of energetic ions during growth phase; (4) The ratio between quiet and disturbed times for the intensities of ion ionospheric outflow is similar to those observed in the near-Earth magnetosphere at &gt;274 keV. Therefore, the increase of the energetic ion intensity during disturbed time is likely due to the intensification and the effective acceleration of the ionospheric source. In conclusion, the energization process in the near-Earth magnetosphere is mass dependent and it is more effective for the heavier ions.",

Understanding, therefore, the formation and evolution of energetic particle injections is critical in order to quantify their effect in the inner magnetosphere. We present a case study of a substorm event that occurred during a weak storm (Dst ~ -40 nT) on 14 July 2013. Van Allen Probe B, inside geosynchronous orbit, observed two energetic proton injections within 10 min, with different dipolarization signatures and duration. The first one is a dispersionless, short-timescale injection pulse accompanied by a sharp dipolarization signature, while the second one is a dispersed, longer-timescale injection pulse accompanied by a gradual dipolarization signature. We combined ground magnetometer data from various stations and in situ particle and magnetic field data from multiple satellites in the inner magnetosphere and near-Earth plasma sheet to determine the spatial extent of these injections, their temporal evolution, and their effects in the inner magnetosphere. Our results indicate that there are different spatial and temporal scales at which injections can occur in the inner magnetosphere and depict the necessity of multipoint observations of both particle and magnetic field data in order to determine these scales.",

Typically one dimension of the density enhancements is shorter than others, is directed perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and varies from \u223c0.1 R<SUB>E</SUB> to 10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, with the other two dimensions a factor 3-10 greater. The density structures are oriented with the longest sides in the general direction of the bow shock and magnetopause. Examples of density structures both convecting with the same velocity as the background magnetosheath flow (\u201cembedded plasmoids\u201d), and convecting with an excess x<SUB>GSE</SUB> velocity component (\u201cfast plasmoids\u201d) are found. Possible importance for the impulsive penetration mechanism for plasma entry in the magnetosphere is analyzed by comparing the results to laboratory results, via a parameter scaling. The estimation of the three-dimensional topology of the density enhancements will enable a comparison with localized magnetosheath populations inside the magnetosphere, observed earlier, to determine if these originate from penetrated magnetosheath density enhancements.",

         "abstract": "In the high-latitude regions of Saturn, the ionosphere is strongly coupled to the magnetosphere through the exchange of energy. The influx of energetic particles from Saturn's magnetosphere enhances the ionospheric densities and temperatures, affects the electrodynamical properties of the ionosphere, and contributes to the heating of the thermosphere. It is therefore critical to accurately model the energy deposition of these magnetospheric particles in the upper atmosphere in order to evaluate key ionospheric quantities of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. We present comprehensive results of ionospheric calculations in the auroral regions of Saturn using our Saturn Thermosphere-Ionosphere Model (STIM). We focus on solar minimum conditions during equinox. The atmospheric conditions are derived from the STIM 3-D General Circulation Model. The ionospheric component is self-consistently coupled to the solar and auroral energy deposition component. The precipitating electrons are assumed to have a Maxwellian distribution in energy with a mean energy E<SUB>m</SUB> and an energy flux Q<SUB>0</SUB>. In the presence of hard electron precipitation (1 &lt; E<SUB>m</SUB> \u2264 20 keV) with Q<SUB>0</SUB> &gt; 0.04 mW m<SUP>-2</SUP>, the ionospheric conductances are found to be proportional to the square root of the energy flux, but the response of the ionosphere is not instantaneous and a time delay needs to be applied to Q<SUB>0</SUB> when estimating the conductances. In the presence of soft electron precipitation (E<SUB>m</SUB> &lt; 500 eV) with Q<SUB>0</SUB> \u2264 0.2 mW m<SUP>-2</SUP>, the ionospheric conductances at noon are found to be primarily driven by the Sun. However, soft auroral electrons are efficient at increasing the ionospheric total electron content and at heating the thermal electron population.",

The COSMIC observations reveal the presence of distinct longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC, and these further exhibit a seasonal and local time dependence. The predominant feature observed at all local times in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC is a substantial maximum (minimum) during Northern Hemisphere winter (summer) around 300\u00b0-360\u00b0 geographic longitude. Around equinox, at a fixed local time, a wave 4 variation in longitude prevails in the daytime F region TEC as well as the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC. The wave 4 variation in longitude persists into the nighttime in the F region; however, the nighttime topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC exhibits two maxima in longitude. The COSMIC observations clearly reveal the presence of substantial longitude variations in the F region and topside ionosphere-plasmasphere, and to elucidate the source of the longitude variations, results are presented based on the coupling between the Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere model and the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. The model simulations demonstrate that the orientation of the geomagnetic field plays a fundamental role in generating significant longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere but does not considerably influence longitude variations in the F region ionosphere. The model results further confirm that nonmigrating tides are the primary mechanism for generating longitude variations in the F region ionosphere. The coupled model additionally demonstrates that nonmigrating tides are also of considerable importance for the generation of longitude variations in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere TEC.",

         "abstract": "Recent observations from the 2-D array of high-resolution THEMIS all-sky imagers (ASIs) during the 2008 tail season have shown that the majority of substorm onsets are preceded by equatorward extension of an auroral arc initiated at the poleward boundary of the aurora zone, and that the aurora breakup is likely triggered when this precursor arc reaches the onset region. These observations were used to suggest that substorm onset is driven by a new population of plasma having lower global entropy content than that of the preexisting plasma intruding into the inner plasma sheet. We have taken advantage of conjunctions between the location of the precursor arc observed by the THEMIS ASI and THEMIS spacecraft and identified four events where clear signatures of the proposed new plasma intrusion were observed simultaneously in both the magnetotail and ionosphere. In two of the events, the intrusion plasma was captured more than 10 min before substorm onset in the midtail plasma sheet. The intruding plasma is characterized as the reduction of the pressure and entropy parameter associated with more dipolarized magnetic field, as well as the enhancement of the duskward electric field and earthward flow. In two other events, the plasma intrusion was found within 2 min before onset in the inner plasma sheet region R \u223c11 R<SUB>E</SUB>, which is very close to the onset locations. These observations are consistent with the proposal that intrusion of low-entropy content plasma to the onset region may provide a trigger for substorm onset. We also found two plasma intrusion events not associated with substorm onset in the plasma sheet, which indicates that the new plasma intrusion is not a sufficient condition for substorm onset. We suggest that sufficient pressure and azimuthal pressure gradient buildup in the inner plasma sheet during growth phase should be another necessary condition.",

         "abstract": "We present a fortuitous case of an isolated substorm on 29 March 2009, observed by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interaction during Substorms (THEMIS) probes clustered at \u223c11-14 R<SUB>E</SUB> with simultaneous coverage by the THEMIS ground network. The four probes are at roughly the same radial and azimuthal location, with one probe staying near the neutral sheet during entire growth phase and during the ensuing transition to the substorm expansion phase. Prior to substorm onset, THEMIS observed the damping of earthward convection and development of an embedded tail current sheet with half thickness \u2264 0.15 R<SUB>E</SUB> and current density \u223c20 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP>, while the total magnetic field closest to the neutral sheet was below 2 nT. Tail activity was observed to start prior to substorm onset tailward of the THEMIS probes (&lt;-14 R<SUB>E</SUB>) with the gradual increase of earthward flow and total pressure in front of an earthward moving bursty bulk flow event (BBF). There was no evidence of an outward propagating rarefaction wave prior to BBF onset. Peak flow was accompanied by two short dipolarization pulses, followed by a sharp reduction of the total pressure (up to 30-50%) and a decrease in the lobe magnetic field. By analyzing the lobe field waveforms, we infer their reconnection origin and argue that different onset-related magnetotail phenomena discussed in past literature (BBFs, bubbles, current disruption, nightside flux transfer events, earthward traveling convection regions) are views of the same dissipative structure formed by reconnection, when it is observed from different vantage points. Although the first ionospheric signatures of the substorm were observed near the equatorward edge of the auroral oval, the adaptive magnetospheric model maps the breakup to the tail current sheet at 15-20 R<SUB>E</SUB>, consistent with other estimates of the substorm onset location available in our case. The event provides definite evidence in favor of tail reconnection within a thin current sheet as the primary substorm initiation process. It also demonstrates that actual changes of tail current magnitude in the magnetotail can be an order of magnitude larger, compared to the magnitude of 3-D current inferred from ground observations.",

         "abstract": "We combine 4861 identifications of substorm onsets from satellite global imagers (Polar UVI and IMAGE FUV) with DMSP particle data to investigate the substorm cycle dependence of the diffuse aurora (electrons and ions), monoenergetic aurora (produced by quasi-static electric fields), and broadband aurora (associated with Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration). Although all types of aurora increase at substorm onset, broadband aurora shows a particular association with substorms and, especially, substorm onset. While diffuse electron and monoenergetic auroral precipitating power rises by 79% and 90%, respectively, following an onset, wave aurora rises by 182%. In the first 10-15 min following onset, the power associated with Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration is comparable to monoenergetic acceleration (also called \u201cinverted V\u201d events). In general, this is not the case before onset, or indeed, during recovery. The rise time of the electron diffuse aurora following onset is much slower, about 50 min, and thus presumably extends into recovery. Discrete acceleration, which rises over just a few minutes, is already deep into decline, while diffuse auroral power is still rising. Most of the sharp increase in Alfv\u00e9nic precipitating power at onset is associated with a 132% jump in the characteristic energy associated with broadband acceleration. Previous work has associated PiB signatures (which are compressional) in the magnetotail with dipolarization. More recently, FAST observations near the auroral zone have been used to show that there are nearly simultaneous sharp increases in Alfv\u00e9n waves, apparently created by mode coupling. The present work strongly supports the idea that the Alfv\u00e9nic aurora has a particular connection to substorm onsets, with much of the auroral power over a substorm cycle concentrated shortly after onset. Finally, a superposed epoch analysis of commonly used coupling functions indicates a drop in the mean solar wind driving starting 20 min before substorm onset. However, the distribution of increases and decreases in solar wind driving is roughly symmetric about a peak at zero (no change) but with (rare) large drops in solar wind driving (\u201cnorthward turnings\u201d) outweighing large increases. Comparison with the distribution of random changes in solar wind driving leads us to suggest that probably only a minority of substorms are externally driven.",

A lack of a realistic quantitative SCW model hampers testing model predictions against large sets of spacecraft data. This paper (1) presents a computationally efficient and flexible model with a realistic geometry of field-aligned currents, conveniently parameterized by the SCW strength, longitudinal width, and position, all derived from ground-based midlatitude magnetic variations; and (2) tests the model against INTERMAGNET network observations during substorms and compares its predictions with space magnetometer data. The testing demonstrated significant and systematic discrepancies between the observed and predicted magnetic variations, depending on spacecraft location, concurrent magnetotail configuration, and substorm phase. In particular, we found that the net SCW current derived from the midlatitude field variations corresponds to only a relatively small and variable fraction of the distant 3-D substorm current, inferred from spacecraft data in the lobe and at geosynchronous distance. The discrepancy can be partly attributed to additional region 2 polarity field-aligned currents in the same longitudinal sector, associated with azimuthal diversion of the earthward plasma flow when it encounters the region of strong quasi-dipolar field in the inner magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Inside the magnetosheath, the IBEX-Hi energetic neutral atom (ENA) imager measures a distinct background count rate that is more than 10 times the typical heliospheric ENA emissions observed when IBEX is outside the magnetosheath. The source of this enhancement is magnetosheath ions of solar wind (SW) origin that deflect around the Earth's magnetopause (MP), scatter and neutralize from the anti-sunward part of the IBEX-Hi sunshade, and continue into the instrument as neutral atoms, behaving indistinguishably from ENAs emitted from distant plasma sources. While this background pollutes observations of outer heliospheric ENAs, it provides a clear signature of IBEX crossings over the magnetospheric boundaries. In this study, we investigate IBEX encounters with the magnetosheath boundaries using \u223c8 yr of orbital data, and we determine the MP and bow shock (BS) locations derived from this background signal. We find 280 BS crossings from X<SUB>GSE</SUB> \u223c 11 R<SUB>e</SUB> to X<SUB>GSE</SUB> \u223c \u221236 R<SUB>e</SUB> and 241 MP crossings from X<SUB>GSE</SUB> \u223c 6 R<SUB>e</SUB> to X<SUB>GSE</SUB> \u223c \u221248 R<SUB>e</SUB>. We compare IBEX BS and MP crossing locations to those from IMP-8, Geotail, Cluster, Magion-4, ISEE, and Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission, and we find that IBEX crossing locations overlap with the BS and MP locations inferred from these other data sets. In this paper, we demonstrate how IBEX can be used to identify magnetosheath crossings, and extend boundary observations well past the terminator, thus further constraining future models of magnetosheath boundaries. Furthermore, we use the IBEX data set to show observational evidence of near-Earth magnetotail squeezing during periods of strong interplanetary magnetic field B<SUB>y</SUB>.",

         "abstract": "In order to study the coupling mechanism between the solar wind and the magnetosphere, we use a numerical model to simulate the global magnetosphere and to predict potential favorable reconnection locations. We propose that a \"switch-like\" magnetosphere exists at Uranus in both equinox and solstice seasons, where the planetary rotation drives the interchange between an open magnetosphere and a closed magnetosphere each Uranus day. This periodic reconnection is predicted to occur upstream of the magnetopause, with a frequency that corresponds to the planetary rotation (once per 17.24 h). The locations of the bow shock and magnetopause in our model are validated against measurements made by Voyager 2. In examining the evolution of the magnetic field configuration along with that of high plasma beta regions, which in combination indicate where the system is favorable for reconnection, we found that the reconnection that occurs is highly dependent on the rotation of the planetary magnetic field in both equinox and solstice seasons. These periodic reconnection events in our simulation support our hypothesis of a periodic \"switch-like\" magnetosphere at Uranus.",

         "abstract": "Flux transfer events observed at Mercury, Earth, and Jupiter are attributed to spatially and temporally limited events in which the magnetosheath and magnetospheric magnetic field become interconnected and magnetic flux is transported from the dayside to the lobes of the magnetotail. Examination of the Saturnian magnetopause at local times from 1000 to 1400 shows no evidence for this phenomenon. Nevertheless, we do find brief intervals during which the normal component of the magnetic field across the magnetopause becomes significantly enhanced for typically one to ten minutes. Magnetosheath electrons appear during these episodes of enhanced magnetic field normal components indicating that indeed the magnetosphere is connected to the magnetosheath by these magnetic bridges. To determine if this magnetic connection leads to a measurable transfer of magnetic flux from the dayside, we check the location of the magnetopause standoff distance for both northward and southward magnetosheath fields. In 71 crossings, we find no obvious dependence of the distance on the direction of the magnetosheath field, indicating that the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field is not a major factor in the determination of the location of the Saturnian magnetopause. This is unlike the position of the terrestrial magnetosphere that undergoes significant motion through reconnection with the interplanetary magnetic field.",

         "abstract": "Spectrographic images in the far ultraviolet, obtained from observations made from 2007 to 2009, are used to quantify and compare the morphology of Saturn's northern and southern aurora in local time. Made by the UVIS imager on the Cassini spacecraft, these observations differ from previous UV observations of Saturn's aurora by offering complete local time coverage of the aurora from small zenith angles. A statistical picture emerges after combining over 10<SUP>5</SUP> spectrographic images of the north and south aurora. From its composite, the northern aurora exhibits an intensity peak of \u223c40 kR near 05 h local time, while the southern aurora peaks at \u223c60 kR near the same local time. Aurora intensities in the post-noon sectors are essentially constant at \u223c10 kR. The half-power points of latitudinal profiles reveal widths of \u223c4\u00b0 near dawn and \u223c8\u00b0 near dusk in both north and south. The aurora has an approximately circular shape (not oval!), although harmonic fits suggest the northern aurora is more nearly circular than the southern. The center of the northern aurora has an offset of \u223c1-2\u00b0 from the pole, while the southern center is offset by \u223c2-3\u00b0, with both offsets in the midnight-to-dawn quadrant. When mapped to the polar regions, precipitation of field-aligned energetic electrons (&gt;20 keV) generally lies equatorward of the main auroral intensity at all local times.",

         "abstract": "Energetic particle bursts associated with dipolarization events within Mercury's magnetosphere were first observed by Mariner 10. The events appear analogous to particle injections accompanying dipolarization events at Earth. The Energetic Particle Spectrometer (3 s resolution) aboard MESSENGER determined the particle bursts are composed entirely of electrons with energies \u2273 300 keV. Here we use the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer high-time-resolution (10 ms) energetic electron measurements to examine the relationship between energetic electron injections and magnetic field dipolarization in Mercury's magnetotail. Between March 2013 and April 2015, we identify 2,976 electron burst events within Mercury's magnetotail, 538 of which are closely associated with dipolarization events. These dipolarizations are detected on the basis of their rapid ( 2 s) increase in the northward component of the tail magnetic field (\u0394B<SUB>z</SUB> 30 nT), which typically persists for 10 s. Similar to those at Earth, we find that these dipolarizations appear to be low-entropy, depleted flux tubes convecting planetward following the collapse of the inner magnetotail. We find that electrons experience brief, yet intense, betatron and Fermi acceleration during these dipolarizations, reaching energies 130 keV and contributing to nightside precipitation. Thermal protons experience only modest betatron acceleration. While only 25% of energetic electron events in Mercury's magnetotail are directly associated with dipolarization, the remaining events are consistent with the Near-Mercury Neutral Line model of magnetotail injection and eastward drift about Mercury, finding that electrons may participate in Shabansky-like closed drifts about the planet. Magnetotail dipolarization may be the dominant source of energetic electron acceleration in Mercury's magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Motivated by recent event studies and modeling efforts on pulsating aurora, which conclude that the precipitation energy during these events is high enough to cause significant chemical changes in the mesosphere, this study looks for the bulk behavior of auroral pulsations. Based on about 400 pulsating aurora events, we outline the typical duration, geomagnetic conditions, and change in the peak emission height for the events. We show that the auroral peak emission height for both green and blue emission decreases by about 8 km at the start of the pulsating aurora interval. This brings the hardest 10% of the electrons down to about 90 km altitude. The median duration of pulsating aurora is about 1.4 h. This value is a conservative estimate since in many cases the end of event is limited by the end of auroral imaging for the night or the aurora drifting out of the camera field of view. The longest durations of auroral pulsations are observed during events which start within the substorm recovery phases. As a result, the geomagnetic indices are not able to describe pulsating aurora. Simultaneous Antarctic auroral images were found for 10 pulsating aurora events. In eight cases auroral pulsations were seen in the southern hemispheric data as well, suggesting an equatorial precipitation source and a frequent interhemispheric occurrence. The long lifetimes of pulsating aurora, their interhemispheric occurrence, and the relatively high-precipitation energies make this type of aurora an effective energy deposition process which is easy to identify from the ground-based image data.",

         "abstract": "Theory and observations have linked equatorial VLF waves with pulsating aurora for decades, invoking the process of pitch angle scattering of tens of keV electrons in the equatorial magnetosphere. Recently published satellite studies have strengthened this argument, by showing strong correlation between pulsating auroral patches and both lower-band chorus and tens of keV electron modulation in the vicinity of geosynchronous orbit. Additionally, a previous link has been made between Pc4-5 compressional pulsations and modulation of whistler-mode chorus using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms. In the current study, we present simultaneous in situ observations of structured chorus waves and an apparent field line resonance (in the Pc4-5 range) as a result of a substorm injection, observed by Van Allen Probes, along with ground-based observations of pulsating aurora. We demonstrate the likely scenario being one of substorm-driven Pc4-5 ULF pulsations modulating chorus waves, and thus providing the driver for pulsating particle precipitation into the Earth's atmosphere. Interestingly, the modulated chorus wave and ULF wave periods are well correlated, with chorus occurring at half the periodicity of the ULF waves. We also show, for the first time, a particular few-Hz modulation of individual chorus elements that coincides with the same modulation in a nearby pulsating aurora patch. Such modulation has been noticed as a high-frequency component in ground-based camera data of pulsating aurora for decades and may be a result of nonlinear chorus wave interactions in the equatorial region.",

         "abstract": "To understand magnetosphere-ionosphere conditions that result in thermal emission velocity enhancement (STEVE) and subauroral ion drifts (SAID) during the substorm recovery phase, we present substorm aurora, particle injection, and current systems during two STEVE events. Those events are compared to substorm events with similar strength but without STEVE. We found that the substorm surge and intense upward currents for the events with STEVE reach the dusk, while those for the non-STEVE substorms are localized around midnight. The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite observations show that location of particle injection and fast plasma sheet flows for the STEVE events also shifts duskward. Electron injection is stronger and ion injection is weaker for the STEVE events compared to the non-STEVE events. SAID are measured by Super Dual Auroral Radar Network during the STEVE events, but the non-STEVE events only showed latitudinally wide subauroral polarization streams without SAID. To interpret the observations, Rice Convection Model (RCM) simulations with injection at premidnight and midnight have been conducted. The simulations successfully explain the stronger electron injection, weaker ion injection, and formation of SAID for injection at premidnight, because injected electrons reach the premidnight inner magnetosphere and form a narrower separation between the ion and electron inner boundaries. We suggest that substorms and particle injections extending far duskward away from midnight offer a condition for creating STEVE and SAID due to stronger electron injection to premidnight. The THEMIS all-sky imager network identified the east-west length of the STEVE arc to be ~1900 km (~2.5 h magnetic local time) and the duration to be 1-1.5 h.",

A unique alignment of several spacecraft near the Earth-Sun line together with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, ground-based magnetometer, and auroral observations allow a comprehensive timing analysis of the events leading to substorm onset. Perplexingly, prior to substorm onset Geotail measured for 26 min positive IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> just upstream of the bow shock, while simultaneously MMS spacecraft measured several intervals of strong negative B<SUB>z</SUB> in the dayside magnetosheath. These strong pulses of negative B<SUB>z</SUB> in the magnetosheath were associated with high dynamic pressure magnetosheath jets, likely created by foreshock transients during strongly radial IMF interval. Multipoint plasma and magnetic field measurements from ARTEMIS and THEMIS spacecraft were used to determine tail reconnection time at 8:14 and location at x=-33R<SUB>E</SUB>. Ground-based observations of Pi2 pulsations and auroral brightening, with observations of a dipolarization front by THEMIS spacecraft, allowed determination of substorm onset to be at \u224808:17. All MMS spacecraft detected the same magnetosheath jet structure with B<SUB>z</SUB>=-25 nT at \u223c08:00 while IMF was northward. Based on DMSP observations and timing analysis we propose that these jets produced magnetopause reconnection leading to final, critical flux enhancement in the midtail region, which may have triggered reconnection 12-14 min later after jet observations.",

In this paper, the interaction between a foreshock transient and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system is investigated using dayside aurora imagers revealing structures and propagation in greater detail than previously possible. A foreshock transient was detected by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms B and C during 1535-1545 UT on 25 June 2008. Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms A, D, and E observed magnetopause compression, cold plasma enhancement, and ultralow frequency waves in the dayside magnetosphere. The all-sky imager at South Pole observed that both diffuse and discrete aurora brightened locally soon after the appearance of this foreshock transient. The diffuse aurora brightening, which corresponded to a region a few Re size in geocentric solar magnetospheric Y in the equatorial plane, propagated duskward with an average speed of 100 km/s. Soon after the diffuse aurora brightened, discrete aurora also brightened and extended duskward, which was consistent with the motion of the foreshock transient as it swept through the magnetosheath while impacting the magnetopause. Equivalent horizontal currents measured by magnetometers revealed a pair of field-aligned currents moving duskward consistent with motion of the discrete aurora patterns. We conclude that the high-resolution and two-dimensional observation of auroral responses by ground-based all-sky imager can help to estimate the evolution and propagation of upstream foreshock transients and their substantial impacts on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system, including magnetospheric compression and currents in the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Effects of subgrid-scale gravity waves (GWs) on the diurnal migrating tides are investigated from the mesosphere to the upper thermosphere for September equinox conditions, using a general circulation model coupled with the extended spectral nonlinear GW parameterization of Yi\u011fit et al. (&lt;link href=\"#jgra53482-bib-0076\"/&gt;). Simulations with GW effects cut off above the turbopause and included in the entire thermosphere have been conducted. GWs appreciably impact the mean circulation and cool the thermosphere down by up to 12-18%. GWs significantly affect the winds modulated by the diurnal migrating tide, in particular, in the low-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the high-latitude thermosphere. These effects depend on the mutual correlation of the diurnal phases of the GW forcing and tides: GWs can either enhance or reduce the tidal amplitude. In the low-latitude MLT, the correlation between the direction of the deposited GW momentum and the tidal phase is positive due to propagation of a broad spectrum of GW harmonics through the alternating winds. In the Northern Hemisphere high-latitude thermosphere, GWs act against the tide due to an anticorrelation of tidal wind and GW momentum, while in the Southern high-latitudes they weakly enhance the tidal amplitude via a combination of a partial correlation of phases and GW-induced changes of the circulation. The variable nature of GW effects on the thermal tide can be captured in GCMs provided that a GW parameterization (1) considers a broad spectrum of harmonics, (2) properly describes their propagation, and (3) correctly accounts for the physics of wave breaking/saturation.",

         "abstract": "The observations made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft in the topside (\u2265200 km) ionosphere of Mars show that this region is very responsive to the variations of the external (solar extreme ultraviolet flux, solar wind, and interplanetary magnetic field [IMF]) and internal (the crustal magnetic field) drivers. With the growth of the solar irradiance the ionosphere broadens while with increase of the solar wind dynamic pressure it shrinks. As a result, the upper ionospheric boundary at solar zenith angles of 60-70\u00b0 can move from \u223c400 to \u223c1,200 km. Similar trends are observed at the nightside ionosphere. At P<SUB>dyn</SUB> \u2265 1-2 nPa the nightside ionosphere becomes very fragmented and depleted. On the other hand, the ion density in the nightside ionosphere significantly (up to a factor of 10) increases with the rise of the solar extreme ultraviolet flux. Large-amplitude motions of the topside ionosphere also occur with variations of the value of the cross-flow component of the IMF. The upper dayside ionosphere at altitudes of more than 300-400 km is sensitive also to the direction of the cross-flow component of the IMF or, correspondingly, to the direction of the motional electric field in the solar wind. The ionosphere becomes very asymmetrical with respect to the V<SUB>sw</SUB>\u00d7B<SUB>IMF</SUB> direction and the asymmetry strongly enhances at the nightside. The topside ionosphere above the areas with strong crustal magnetic field in the dayside southern hemisphere is significantly denser and expands to higher altitudes as compared to the ionosphere above the northern nonmagnetized lowlands. The crustal magnetic field also protects the nightside ionosphere from being filled by plasma transported from the dayside. The draping IMF penetrates deeply into the ionosphere and actively influences its structure. Weak fields and, correspondingly, weak magnetic field forces only slightly affect the ionosphere. With increase of the induced magnetic field strength the transport motions driven by the magnetic field pressure and field tensions seem to be intensified and we observe that the local ion densities at the dayside considerably decrease. A different trend is observed at the nightside. The ion density in the nightside ionosphere above the northern lowlands is higher than in the southern hemisphere indicating that plasma transport from the dayside is the main source of the nightside ionosphere. Nonstop variations in the solar wind, the IMF and the solar irradiance together with planetary rotation of the crustal magnetic field sources lead to a continuous expansion/shrinking and reconfiguration of the topside ionosphere of Mars.",

         "abstract": "Jupiter's magnetosphere is often said to be rotationally driven, with strong centrifugal stresses due to large spatial scales and a rapid planetary rotation period. While the solar wind is therefore expected to have a relatively small influence on Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurora, there is considerable observational evidence that the solar wind does affect the magnetopause standoff distance, auroral radio emissions, and the ultraviolet auroral position and brightness. We report on the results of a comprehensive, quantitative study of the influence of the solar wind dynamic pressure on magnetospheric data sets measured by the Galileo mission (1996-2003). Using model predictions of the solar wind conditions near Jupiter calculated by propagating measurements made near the Earth, we have established how predicted changes in the solar wind affect the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field in the magnetosphere, the hectometric auroral radio emissions, and energetic particles in Jupiter's magnetosphere. We find that increases in the solar wind dynamic pressure are statistically associated with magnetospheric compression events but that tail reconnection and plasmoid release is most likely driven internally by the Vasyliunas cycle. We find no link between solar wind conditions and the occurrence of quasiperiodic modulations in the magnetosphere. Overall, we conclude that activity in Jupiter's magnetosphere is both internally and solar wind driven. Finally, we examine the effects of solar wind-induced magnetospheric compressions on Jupiter's auroral brightness and mapping, finding that a solar wind compression could shift the auroral mapping of a given point in the magnetosphere by ~3\u00b0 on average.",

         "abstract": "Magnetospheric substorms represent key explosive processes in the interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind, and their understanding and modeling are critical for space weather forecasting. During substorms, the magnetic field on the nightside is first stretched in the antisunward direction and then it rapidly contracts earthward bringing hot plasmas from the distant space regions into the inner magnetosphere, where they contribute to geomagnetic storms and Joule dissipation in the polar ionosphere, causing impressive splashes of aurora. Here we show for the first time that mining millions of spaceborne magnetometer data records from multiple missions allows one to reconstruct the global 3-D picture of these stretching and dipolarization processes. Stretching results in the formation of a thin (less than the Earth's radius) and strong current sheet, which is diverted into the ionosphere during dipolarization. In the meantime, the dipolarization signal propagates further into the inner magnetosphere resulting in the accumulation of a longer lived current there, giving rise to a protogeomagnetic storm. The global 3-D structure of the corresponding substorm currents including the substorm current wedge is reconstructed from data.",

Substorm onset and a later intensification coincided with polar cap patches entering the auroral oval to become auroral blobs. Using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers and optical data, we show severe scintillation driven by intense auroral emissions in the line of sight between the receiver and the satellites. During substorm expansion, the area of scintillation followed the intense poleward edge of the auroral oval. The intense auroral emissions were colocated with polar cap patches (blobs). The patches did not contain strong irregularities, neither before entering the auroral oval nor after the aurora had faded. Signals from all three GNSS constellations were similarly affected by the irregularities. Furthermore, two receivers spaced around 120km apart reported highly different scintillation impacts, with strong scintillation on half of the satellites in one receiver and no scintillation in the other. This shows that areas of severe irregularities in the nightside ionosphere can be highly localized. Amplitude scintillations were low throughout the entire interval.",

Lastly, we choose a frontal perpendicular shock, FPS, whose shock normal is along the Sun-Earth line, with the same Mach number as IOS-1. We find that, in the IOS-1 case, due to the north-south asymmetry, the magnetotail is deflected southward, leading to a mild compression. The geomagnetic activity observed in the nightside ionosphere is then weak. On the other hand, in the head-on case, the FPS compresses the magnetotail from both sides symmetrically. This compression triggers a substorm allowing a larger amount of stored energy in the magnetotail to be released to the nightside ionosphere, resulting in stronger geomagnetic activity. By comparing IOS-2 and FPS, we find that, despite the IOS-2 having a larger Mach number, the FPS leads to a larger geomagnetic response in the nightside ionosphere. As a result, we conclude that IP shocks with similar upstream conditions, such as magnetic field, speed, density, and Mach number, can have different geoeffectiveness, depending on their shock normal orientation.",

         "abstract": "Magnetosheath high-speed jets (HSJs) are dayside upstream transient disturbances with enhanced flow velocity and dynamic pressure. They are associated with significant magnetopause perturbations, ultralow frequency waves in the dayside magnetosphere, and localized flow enhancements in the ionosphere. However, whether HSJs have corresponding dayside aurora signatures is still an open question. If auroral signatures are found, 2-D structure and evolution of HSJ effects on the magnetosphere can be imaged in a much higher precision than possible by other means. In this study, eight HSJ events are identified by the THEMIS satellites located within \u00b11 MLT of the center of the field-of-view of the South Pole station all-sky imager. In all of those cases, the HSJs are observed to have a nearly one-to-one relationship with individual localized discrete/diffuse auroral brightenings. The azimuthal size of HSJ-related diffuse aurora signatures is 800 km at 230-km altitude in the ionosphere and 3.7 Re in the magnetosphere, which is slightly larger but of the order of the cross-sectional diameter of HSJs ( 1 Re). Furthermore, most of those aurora signatures have azimuthal motion, whose magnitude and direction agree with magnetosheath background flows. This study for the first time shows high-resolution, two-dimensional observations of localized structure and fast propagation of precipitation due to magnetosheath HSJs. We conclude that magnetosheath HSJs can have substantial impacts on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system, causing localized magnetospheric compression and aurora brightening, in a similar manner to responses during interplanetary shocks except with a smaller scale size.",

         "abstract": "The subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) are one of the most important features in representing magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art modeling framework that couples an inner magnetospheric ring current model RAM-SCB with a global MHD model Block-Adaptive Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and an ionospheric potential solver to study the SAPS that occurred during the 17 March 2013 storm event as well as to assess the modeling capability. Both ionospheric and magnetospheric signatures associated with SAPS are analyzed to understand the spatial and temporal evolution of the electrodynamics in the midlatitude regions. Results show that the model captures the SAPS at subauroral latitudes, where Region 2 field-aligned currents (FACs) flow down to the ionosphere and the conductance is lower than in the higher-latitude auroral zone. Comparisons to observations such as FACs observed by Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), cross-track ion drift from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and in situ electric field observations from the Van Allen Probes indicate that the model generally reproduces the global dynamics of the Region 2 FACs, the position of SAPS along the DMSP, and the location of the SAPS electric field around L of 3.0 in the inner magnetosphere near the equator. The model also demonstrates double westward flow channels in the dusk sector (the higher-latitude auroral convection and the subauroral SAPS) and captures the mechanism of the SAPS. However, the comparison with ion drifts along DMSP trajectories shows an underestimate of the magnitude of the SAPS and the sensitivity to the specific location and time. The comparison of the SAPS electric field with that measured from the Van Allen Probes shows that the simulated SAPS electric field penetrates deeper than in reality, implying that the shielding from the Region 2 FACs in the model is not well represented. Possible solutions in future studies to improve the modeling capability include implementing a self-consistent ionospheric conductivity module from inner magnetosphere particle precipitation, coupling with the thermosphere-ionosphere chemical processes, and connecting the ionosphere with the inner magnetosphere by the stronger Region 2 FACs calculated in the inner magnetosphere model.",

The magnetospheric responses to these structures and consequent ionospheric drivers are simulated using the numerical Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere model and the empirical Weimer 2005 model, finding that the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is more important than solar wind speed and density per se in controlling magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model is then employed to calculate neutral density, nitric oxide cooling, and electron density, for comparison to space-based measurements from the STAR instrument on the CHAMP satellite, the SABER instrument on the TIMED satellite, and GPS occultations from the COSMIC mission, respectively. The recurrent, periodic changes observed under solar minimum conditions during 2008, and particularly during the Whole Heliospheric Interval (March-April of 2008), are simulated by the model and compared to these measurements. Numerical experiments were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of solar wind and IMF forcing, setting the solar wind speed and density to nominal values, smoothing the IMF, and also setting it to zero. The results confirm the importance of IMF variations, particularly its north-south component (B<SUB>z</SUB>), but also show that when the average B<SUB>z</SUB> values are negative (southward), the interaction with increased solar wind speed amplifies the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere response. Conversely, during events when B<SUB>z</SUB> is on average positive (northward), even large increases in solar wind speed have small effects on the system.",

Recent analysis showed that the buildup of hot ion population in the inner magnetosphere largely occurs in the form of localized discrete injections associated with sharp dipolarizations of magnetic field, similar to dipolarization fronts in the magnetotail. Because of significant differences between the ambient magnetic field and the dipolarization front properties in the magnetotail and the inner magnetosphere, the physical mechanisms of ion acceleration at dipolarization fronts in these two regions may also be different. In this paper we discuss a new acceleration mechanism enabled by stable trapping of ions at the azimuthally localized dipolarization fronts. It is shown that trapping can provide a robust mechanism of ion energization in the inner magnetosphere even in the absence of large electric fields.",

         "abstract": "When a magnetosheath jet (localized dynamic pressure enhancements) compresses ambient magnetosheath at a (relative) speed faster than the local magnetosonic speed, a bow wave or shock can form ahead of the jet. Such bow waves or shocks were recently observed to accelerate particles, thus contributing to magnetosheath heating and particle acceleration in the extended environment of Earth's bow shock. To further understand the characteristics of jet-driven bow waves, we perform a statistical study to examine which solar wind conditions favor their formation and whether it is common for them to accelerate particles. We identified 364 out of 2,859 (~13%) magnetosheath jets to have a bow wave or shock ahead of them with Mach number typically larger than 1.1. We show that large solar wind plasma beta, weak interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, large solar wind Alfv\u00e9n Mach number, and strong solar wind dynamic pressure present favorable conditions for their formation. We also show that magnetosheath jets with bow waves or shocks are more frequently associated with higher maximum ion and electron energies than those without them, confirming that it is common for these structures to accelerate particles. In particular, magnetosheath jets with bow waves have electron energy flux enhanced on average by a factor of 2 compared to both those without bow waves and the ambient magnetosheath. Our study implies that magnetosheath jets can contribute to shock acceleration of particles especially for high Mach number shocks. Therefore, shock models should be generalized to include magnetosheath jets and concomitant particle acceleration.",

         "abstract": "Observations by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft (MMS) of an unusual layer, located between the dayside magnetosheath and the magnetosphere, alternating with encounters with the magnetosheath during an extended time period between December 31, 2015 and January 01, 2016, when the interplanetary magnetic field was strongly southward and the Earth's dipole tilt large and negative, are presented. It appears to have been magnetically connected to both magnetosphere and magnetosheath. The layer appears to be located mostly on closed field lines and was bounded by a rotational discontinuity (RD) at its magnetosheath edge and by the magnetosphere on its earthward side. A separatrix layer, with heated magnetosheath electrons streaming unidirectionally along the field lines, was present sunward of the RD. We infer that the layer was started by a dominant reconnection site well north of the spacecraft and that it may have gained additional width, from a large drop in solar wind density and ram pressure, which preceded the beginning of the event by more than an hour. Relative to the magnetosheath, in which the magnetic field was strongly southward, this unusual layer was characterized by a less southward, more dawnward magnetic field of lower magnitude. The plasma density and flow speed in the region were lower than in the magnetosheath, albeit with Alfv\u00e9nic jetting occurring at the magnetosheath edge as well as at the magnetospheric edge of the layer. The closing of the magnetic field lines requires the existence of another reconnection site, located southward/tailward of MMS.",

It is considered that transient reconnection causes localized auroral arcs or spots in the Jovian magnetosphere, by analogy to the case in the Earth's magnetosphere. However, the local structures of transient reconnection events (i.e., magnetospheric plasma parameters) and their spatial distribution have not been extensively investigated for the Jovian magnetosphere. Here we examine plasma velocity and density during strong north-south magnetic field events in the Jovian nightside magnetosphere, which may be associated with tail reconnection. We find prominent reconnection jet fronts predominantly on the dawnside of the nightside magnetosphere, which would be a signature unique to rotation-dominant planetary magnetospheres. The observed plasma structures are consistent with significant field-aligned currents which would generate localized aurora.",

         "abstract": "Pulsating aurora is a common phenomenon generally believed to occur mainly in the aftermath of a substorm, where dim long-period pulsating patches appear. The study determines the temporal and spatial evolution of pulsating events using two THEMIS all-sky imager stations, at Gillam (66.18 magnetic latitude, 332.78 magnetic longitude, magnetic midnight at 0634 UT) and Fort Smith, (67.38 magnetic latitude, 306.64 magnetic longitude, magnetic midnight at 0806 UT) along roughly the same invariant latitude. Parameters have been calculated from a database of 74 pulsating aurora events from 119 days of good optical data within the period from September 2007 through March 2008 as identified with the Gillam camera. It is shown that the source region of pulsating aurora drifts or expands eastward, away from magnetic midnight, for premidnight onsets and that the spatial evolution is more complicated for postmidnight onsets, which has implications for the source mechanism. The most probable duration of a pulsating aurora event is roughly 1.5 h, while the distribution of possible event durations includes many long (several hours) events. This may suggest that pulsating aurora is not strictly a substorm recovery phase phenomenon but rather a persistent, long-lived phenomenon that may be temporarily disrupted by auroral substorms. Observations from the Gillam station show that in fact, pulsating aurora is quite common with the occurrence rate increasing to around 60% for morning hours, with 69% of pulsating aurora onsets occurring after substorm breakup.",

         "abstract": "The orientation of the Earth's magnetic field has changed dramatically during the geological past. We have investigated the effects of changes in dipole tilt angle on the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere, using the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere (CMIT) model. The dipole tilt angle modulates the efficiency of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling, by influencing the diurnal variation in the angle \u03bc between the dipole axis and the GSM z axis. This influences how much Joule heating occurs at high magnetic latitudes. The dipole tilt angle also controls the geographic distribution of the Joule heating, as it determines the geographic latitude of the magnetic poles. Changes in the amount and distribution of Joule heating with tilt an`gle produce further changes in temperature and neutral winds. The latter affect the O/N<SUB>2</SUB> ratio, which in turn modifies the peak electron density of the F<SUB>2</SUB> layer, N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>. All these effects are most important when the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) is southward, while being almost negligible under northward IMF. However, a change in dipole tilt also changes the inclination of the magnetic field, which affects the vertical component of ionospheric plasma diffusion along the magnetic field, regardless of the IMF direction. Changes in vertical plasma diffusion are responsible for \u223c2/3 of the changes in N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> and most of the low to midlatitude changes in h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> under southward IMF and for most of the changes in both variables under northward IMF. Thermal contraction may be responsible for high-latitude decreases in h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> with increasing tilt angle under southward IMF.",

         "abstract": "Spacecraft observations and global hybrid (kinetic ions and fluid electrons) simulations have demonstrated that ion dissipation processes at the quasi-parallel bow shock are associated with the formation of structures called spontaneous hot flow anomalies (SHFAs). Previous simulations and recent spacecraft observations have also established that SHFAs result in the formation of magnetosheath filamentary structures (MFS). In this paper we demonstrate that in addition to MFS, SHFAs also result in the formation of magnetosheath cavities that are associated with decreases in density, velocity, and magnetic field and enhancements in temperature. We use the results of a global MHD run to determine the change in the magnetosheath properties associated with cavities due to ion kinetic effects. The results also show the formation of regions of high flow speed called magnetosheath jets whose properties as a function of solar wind Mach number are described in this study. Comparing the properties of the simulated magnetosheath cavities and jets to past spacecraft observations provides good agreement in both cases. We also demonstrate that pressure variations associated with cavities and SHFAs in the sheath result in a continuous sunward and antisunward magnetopause motion. This result is consistent with previous suggestions that SHFAs may be responsible for the generation of ion cyclotron waves and precipitation of ring current protons in the outer magnetosphere.",

In this paper, the progress reached in investigations of long-term trends in the upper atmosphere and mesosphere in the last 2 years is briefly summarized. First information appeared about trends in electron temperature (positive trend), thermospheric neutral wind (complex pattern), and total electron content (nonnegative trend). Some new information created partial apparent discrepancies, particularly in the case of ion temperature trends. The quantitative discrepancy between observation-based and model-based trends in mesospheric temperatures and in polar mesospheric clouds has largely been removed. The first observations of trends in CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration in the lower thermosphere suggest a way how to reduce the observation-model difference in the thermosphere and ionosphere. The scenario of trends in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere is now more complete than it was 2 years ago, but still some gaps and discrepancies occur for further investigations.",

         "abstract": "We present the first statistical study of loading and unloading of magnetic flux in Mercury's magnetotail. These events describe the global circulation of magnetic flux through the magnetosphere and provide strong evidence that terrestrial-type substorms take place at Mercury. 438 events were identified over the 4 years of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission by a gradual, short-lived increase in the magnetotail lobe magnetic field strength, coincident with an outward flaring of the magnetotail. Substorm duration ranged from tens of seconds to several minutes, with a median of 195 s and a mean of 212 s. The median amplitude of lobe magnetic field increase was 11.5 nT, which represents an increase of 23.4% on the background lobe field strength, compared with 10% for terrestrial substorms. The magnetotail lobes were found to contain 2-3 MWb of magnetic flux based on 1031 tail passes, with a mean of 2.52 MWb and a standard deviation of 0.48 MWb. An estimate of the change in open flux content during the loading phase of each substorm ranged from 0.08 to 3.7 MWb with a mean value of 0.69 MWb and a standard deviation of 0.38 MWb. These changes in open flux content are an underestimate as the change in magnetotail radius during the events was not accounted for. The maximum lobe flux content during each substorm ( 3 MWb) represented 40% of the total available magnetic flux in the system ( 7.5 MWb). During terrestrial substorms, the maximum lobe magnetic flux content is 10-12% of the total flux from the dipole. A typical substorm at Mercury therefore cycles through a significantly larger fraction of the available magnetic flux than all but the largest substorms at the Earth.",

Both the COSMIC observations and TIME-GCM simulations reveal perturbations in the &lt;fi&gt;F&lt;/fi&gt; region peak height (h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) at Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes during SSW time periods. The perturbations are \u223c20-30 km, which corresponds to 10-20% variability of the background mean h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>. The TIME-GCM simulations and COSMIC observations of the h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability are in overall good agreement, and the simulations can thus be used to understand the physical processes responsible for the h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability. Through comparison of simulations with and without the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M<SUB>2</SUB>), we conclude that the midlatitude h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> variability is primarily driven by the propagation of the M<SUB>2</SUB> into the thermosphere where it modulates the field-aligned neutral winds, which in turn raise and lower the &lt;fi&gt;F&lt;/fi&gt; region peak height. Though there are subtle differences, the consistency of the behavior between the 2009 and 2013 SSWs suggests that variability in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude ionosphere and thermosphere is a consistent feature of the SSW impact on the upper atmosphere.",

The first specified dynamics WACCM-X v.2.0 results are compared with several data sets, and with the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM), during the deep solar minimum year. Comparisons with Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite of temperature and zonal wind in the lower thermosphere show that WACCM-X reproduces the seasonal variability of tides remarkably well, including the migrating diurnal and semidiurnal components and the nonmigrating diurnal eastward propagating zonal wavenumber 3 component. There is overall agreement between WACCM-X, TIE-GCM, and vertical drifts observed by the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS) satellite over the magnetic equator, but apparent discrepancies also exist. Both model results are dominated by diurnal variations, while C/NOFS observed vertical plasma drifts exhibit strong temporal variations. The climatological features of ionospheric peak densities and heights (NmF<SUB>2</SUB> and hmF<SUB>2</SUB>) from WACCM-X are in general agreement with the results derived from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) data, although the WACCM-X predicted NmF<SUB>2</SUB> values are smaller, and the equatorial ionization anomaly crests are closer to the magnetic equator compared to COSMIC and ionosonde observations. This may result from the excessive mixing in the lower thermosphere due to the gravity wave parameterization. These data-model comparisons demonstrate that WACCM-X can capture the dynamic behavior of the coupled atmosphere and ionosphere in a climatological sense.",

We use simulations with the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere model to investigate how the magnetosphere, upper atmosphere, and solar quiet (Sq) geomagnetic variation respond as the geomagnetic dipole moment M varies between 2\u1e6110<SUP>22</SUP> and 10\u1e6110<SUP>22</SUP> Am<SUP>2</SUP>. We find that the magnetopause stand-off distance and the cross-polar cap potential increase, while the polar cap size decreases, with increasing M. Their dependence on M is stronger than predicted by previous studies. We also show for the first time that the shape of the magnetosphere starts to change for M \u2264 4\u1e6110<SUP>22</SUP> Am<SUP>2</SUP>. This may be due to enhanced magnetopause erosion and/or to strong changes in the ionospheric conductance, which affect the field-aligned currents and the magnetic fields they create in the magnetosphere, thus modifying the magnetic pressure inside the magnetosphere. E \u00d7 B drift velocities, Joule heating power, the global mean thermospheric temperature and the global mean height of the peak of the ionospheric F<SUB>2</SUB> layer, h<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>, all increase with increasing M for low dipole moments, but all decrease with increasing M for larger dipole moments. The peak electron density of the F<SUB>2</SUB> layer, N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>, shows the opposite behavior. The Sq amplitude decreases with increasing M and this dependence can be roughly described by a power law scaling. Most scaling relations show a weak dependence on the solar activity level, which is likely associated with a change in the relative contributions to the Pedersen conductance from the upper and lower ionosphere, which scale differently with M.",

The zonal structure of the QTDW during early 2006 in the Southern Hemisphere MLT and low-latitude ionosphere is dominated by westward propagating zonal wave number 3 (W3) and eastward propagating zonal wave number 2 (E2) components. However, the observed longitude variability is not fully described by the E2 and W3 components of the QTDW. The remaining longitude variability is attributed to the presence of nonmigrating tides and secondary waves generated by the nonlinear interaction of the QTDW with migrating tides. The nonmigrating tides are a combination of those that are generated in situ by QTDW-tide nonlinear interactions and those of tropospheric origin that propagate upward into the MLT. The results presented demonstrate that nonmigrating tides and secondary waves are of considerable importance for determining the total longitude variability during periods of enhanced QTDW activity. The general similarity between the QTDW in OH airglow and temperature indicates that variations in atomic oxygen concentrations due to vertical winds during the QTDW are the primary driver of the QTDW in the OH airglow emission. However, there are some differences in the OH airglow and temperature that we consider to be connected to changes in eddy diffusion due to changes in gravity waves during the QTDW. Last, although similar zonal structure of the QTDW is observed in the ionosphere, the observed longitude variations are not well represented by the QTDW components, indicating that nonmigrating tides play a critical role in determining longitudinal variability in the ionosphere during the QTDW. The importance of nonmigrating tides in the ionosphere may be related to the relative efficiency of the QTDW and different nonmigrating tides in the generation of electric fields.",

Observations have shown that the cross-polar cap potential tends to maximize near the equinoxes, when on average \u03bc = 0, with smaller values observed near the solstices. This is similar to the well-known semiannual variation in geomagnetic activity. We use numerical model simulations to investigate the role of two possible mechanisms that may be responsible for the influence of \u03bc on the magnetosphere-ionosphere system: variations in the coupling efficiency between the solar wind and the magnetosphere and variations in the ionospheric conductance over the polar caps. Under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions, variations in ionospheric conductance at high magnetic latitudes are responsible for 10-30% of the variations in the cross-polar cap potential associated with \u03bc, but variations in solar wind-magnetosphere coupling are more important and responsible for 70-90%. Variations in viscous processes contribute slightly to this, but variations in the reconnection rate with \u03bc are the dominant cause. The variation in the reconnection rate is primarily the result of a variation in the length of the section of the separator line along which relatively strong reconnection occurs. Changes in solar wind-magnetosphere coupling also affect the field-aligned currents, but these are influenced as well by variations in the conductance associated with variations in \u03bc, more so than the cross-polar cap potential. This may be the case for geomagnetic activity too.",

For shear layers with vector velocity changes |\u0394v| &gt; 50 km/s, an average of \u223c12 pass the Earth per day. In the fast wind, \u223c60 sudden shear layers pass the Earth per day (about 2.5 per hour). To explore the effects of sudden wind shears on the Earth's magnetosphere, global magnetospheric MHD simulations with four different simulation codes are performed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) with north-south and east-west wind shears. Windsock movement of the magnetotail is analyzed and comet-like disconnections of the magnetotail and magnetosheath are examined. Sudden changes in the cross-polar-cap potential and ionospheric Joule dissipation are seen as the shear layers pass the Earth. Other potential effects of sudden wind shear on the magnetosphere are discussed.",

         "abstract": "The diffuse aurora is generally believed to be the result of \u223ckeV electron precipitation from the magnetosphere, which presents an important sink of magnetospheric particles, a primary high-latitude ionospheric energy source, and a strong magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling mechanism. Resonant scattering of the plasma sheet electrons by electron cyclotron harmonic and whistler mode chorus waves is suggested to be responsible for the diffuse auroral precipitation. The dependence of quasi-linear diffusion rates and consequent diffuse auroral precipitation on the spatial position L, normal angle, and frequency distribution of both upper-band chorus (UBC) and lower-band chorus (LBC) is investigated in detail. Whistler mode chorus waves are found to be more effective in the production of diffuse aurora at larger L shells. The normal angle and frequency distribution of UBC can significantly affect the diffusion rates for \u223ckeV electrons and the consequent diffuse aurora precipitation. Numerical results show that the strong diffusion limit for \u223ckeV electrons can be reached up to large pitch angles closer to 90\u00b0, and the diffuse auroral precipitation can be remarkably enhanced when the UBC waves possessing a relatively larger normal angle range or centering higher in the band. In contrast, the diffusion rates and diffuse auroral precipitation of electrons with energies E<SUB>k</SUB> &lt; 2 keV are largely independent of the normal angle and frequency distribution of LBC waves. Enhanced precipitations of \u223c5 keV electrons are found to occur when the LBC waves centering higher in the band. The current results suggest that the significant variability of wave characteristics and the variation with spatial position should be taken into account in order to identify the dominant mechanism for diffuse aurora.",

         "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of rapid assimilation-forecast cycling on the performance of ionospheric data assimilation during geomagnetic storm conditions. An ensemble Kalman filter software developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), called Data Assimilation Research Testbed, is applied to assimilate ground-based GPS total electron content (TEC) observations into a theoretical numerical model of the thermosphere and ionosphere (NCAR thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model) during the 26 September 2011 geomagnetic storm period. Effects of various assimilation-forecast cycle lengths: 60, 30, and 10 min on the ionospheric forecast are examined by using the global root-mean-squared observation-minus-forecast (OmF) TEC residuals. Substantial reduction in the global OmF for the 10 min assimilation-forecast cycling suggests that a rapid cycling ionospheric data assimilation system can greatly improve the quality of the model forecast during geomagnetic storm conditions. Furthermore, updating the thermospheric state variables in the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere forecast model in the assimilation step is an important factor in improving the trajectory of model forecasting. The shorter assimilation-forecast cycling (10 min in this paper) helps to restrain unrealistic model error growth during the forecast step due to the imbalance among model state variables resulting from an inadequate state update, which in turn leads to a greater forecast accuracy.",

         "abstract": "A new model for the propagation of ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves in dipolar geometry has been developed. This model features a full height-resolved ionosphere including finite Pedersen, Hall, and parallel conductivities. By using a nonorthogonal coordinate system, this model is capable of calculating the ground magnetic field produced by ULF waves and comparing these fields to those measured in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. This model has been used to investigate the properties of the ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator (IAR) in a dipolar magnetosphere. Although the IAR mode frequencies are not strongly affected by the finite magnetic zenith angle, the damping of these waves is enhanced by the presence of the height-resolved ionosphere. Pedersen conductivity shields higher frequency ULF waves such as Pc1 from penetrating through the ionosphere, limiting the magnitude of the ground magnetic field, whereas Hall conductivity and finite azimuthal wave number enhance the coupling to the ground. Results for runs in which a wave packet is introduced into the model show that the ground magnetic field is enhanced when the central frequency of the wave packet matches a resonant frequency of the IAR. Including a more realistic height-resolved ionosphere yields a more direct calculation of ionospheric fields, allowing a comparison between ground and ionospheric fields.",

A couple of issues remain to be addressed in the EIW model: (1) How is the TM<SUB>0</SUB> mode wave excited by the field-aligned currents (FACs) in the polar region? (2) How are the quasi-steady ionospheric currents achieved by the TM<SUB>0</SUB> mode waves? (3) How simultaneous or delayed are the onset and peak of the equatorial PI with respect to the high-latitude PI? To address these issues, we examine the TEM (TM<SUB>0</SUB>) mode wave propagation in the finite-length transmission lines replacing the pair of FACs (magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) transmission line) and the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (ionosphere-ground (IG) transmission line). The issue (1) is addressed by showing that a fraction of the TEM mode wave is transmitted from the MI to IG transmission lines through the polar ionosphere. To address the issues (2) and (3), we examine the properties of the finite-length IG transmission line with finite ionospheric conductivity. It is shown that the ionospheric currents start to grow instantaneously and continue to grow gradually with time constants of 1-10 s depending on the ionospheric conductivity. The MIG transmission line enables us to explain the instantaneous onset and delayed peak time of the equatorial PI and quick electric field response of the low-latitude ionosphere and inner magnetosphere.",

Here we analyze energetic electrons and ions (mostly protons) in the vicinity (\u00b11 R<SUB>S</SUB>) of Saturn's magnetopause, using particle data acquired with the low energy magnetosphere measurements system, one of the three sensors of the magnetosphere imaging instrument on board the Cassini spacecraft, during a period of \u223c14 years (2004-2017). It is found that energetic particles, especially ions, are also common in Saturn's magnetosheath. A clear inward (toward Saturn) gradient in the electron differential flux is identified, suggestive of magnetospheric sources. Such an inward gradient does not appear in some of the ion channels. We conclude that Saturn's magnetopause acts as a porous barrier for energetic electrons and, to a lesser extent, for energetic ions. A dawn dusk asymmetry in the gradient of particle flux across the magnetopause is also identified, with a gradual decrease at the dawn and a sharp decrease at the dusk magnetopause. It is also found that magnetic reconnection enhanced flux levels just outside of the magnetopause, with evidence suggesting that these particles are from magnetospheric sources. These findings strongly suggest that Saturn's magnetosphere is most likely the main source of energetic particles in Saturn's magnetosheath and magnetosphere leakage is an important process responsible for the presence of the energetic particles in Saturn's magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "Subauroral Polarization Streams (SAPS) are associated with closure of region 2 field-aligned current (R2 FAC) through the low conductivity region. Although SAPS have often been studied from a magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling perspective, recent observations suggest strong interaction also exists between SAPS and the thermosphere. Our study focuses on thermospheric wind driving and its impact on SAPS and R2 FAC during the 17 March 2013 geomagnetic storm using both observations and the physics-based Rice Convection Model-Coupled Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Plasmasphere, electrodynamics (RCM-CTIPe) model that self-consistently couples the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-18 and Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite observations show that, as the storm progresses, sunward ion flows intensify and expand equatorward and are accompanied by strengthening of subauroral neutral winds with some delay. Our model successfully reproduces time evolution and overall structure of the sunward ion drift and neutral wind. A force term analysis is performed to investigate the momentum transfer to the neutrals from the ions. Contrary to previous studies showing that Coriolis force is the main driver of neutrals during storm time, we find that the ion drag is the largest force driving westward neutral wind in the SAPS region where the ion density is low in the trough region. Furthermore, simulations with and without the neutral wind dynamo effect are compared to quantify the effect of the neutral to plasma flow. The comparison shows that the self-consistent active ionosphere thermosphere coupling increases the R2 FAC and the westward ion drift equatorward of the SAPS region by 20% and 40% by the flywheel effect, respectively.",

The weak induced magnetosphere itself is created by the prevailing Solar wind conditions and therefore in its shape and strength dynamically depending on it. In early 2010, Mars was located behind Earth in the Solar wind; thus, we can use coordinated data from multiple near-Earth spacecraft (Stereo, Wind) to evaluate what kind of Solar wind disturbances have passed by Earth and might consecutively hit Mars, and when. We employ plasma data from the ESA Mars-Express mission, the ASPERA-3 particle instrument, and the MARSIS Active Ionospheric Sounder (AIS) to investigate, for a number of isolated events in March and April 2010, how the ionosphere and the induced magnetosphere at Mars develop and decay in response to Solar wind variability in the magnetic field, density, and velocity. In a dedicated campaign mode, we use frequent long-duration MARSIS AIS operations for several consecutive orbits, to monitor for the first time the long-term development of the Martian plasma environment during solar wind disturbances. We find that the magnetosphere and ionosphere of Mars can become considerably compressed by solar wind dynamic pressure variations, which usually are also associated with changes in the magnetic draping of the interplanetary magnetic field around the planet. These are typically associated with corotating interaction regions and coronal mass ejections, and can last for several days. During such episodes of compression, we see signatures of increased plasma transport over the terminator and enhanced ion outflow from the upper atmosphere.",

Perhaps the most basic and important attributes of the plasmasphere are its mass and spatial distribution. However, our understanding is often constrained by the method of measurement. Storm time loss of plasmasphere content is a kind of exhalation where plasma is lost. Refilling or inhalation into the body of the plasmasphere occurs during the following calm. Using a follow the mass approach, storm time plasmasphere loss for 1.5\u2264L&lt;5.5 is found to range from 32% to 62% during three events. Plasma lost inside the average eroded plasmapause boundary ranges from 22% to 42% and outside from 35% to 72%. Following the start of refilling, the innermost L shells show the lowest observed refilling rates. Mass refilling rates at higher L shells rise to a maximum observed \u223c6 Mt/day near L = 4.5 that is less at higher L shells (Mt/d = 1,000 kg/day). More variability and higher refilling rates are found during lower solar activity. The mass content of the plasmasphere between L = 1.5 and 3.0 was also followed for 54 days when it exhibited eight \"breathes.\" Using this analogy, only the first inhale/exhale is \"deep.\" The remaining carry forward the consequences of past and continued activity that prevents full recovery. There appears to be a month long declining trend in the mass of the inner plasmasphere during the last two thirds of this time.",

         "abstract": "We present a new interhemispheric numerical model: the IRAP plasmasphere-ionosphere model (IPIM). This model describes the transport of the multispecies ionospheric plasma from one hemisphere to the other along convecting and corotating magnetic field lines, taking into account source processes at low altitude such as photoproduction, chemistry, and energization through the coupling with a kinetic code solving the transport of suprathermal electron along the field line. Among the new developments, a 16-moment-based approach is used for the transport equations in order to allow development of strong temperature anisotropy at high altitude and we consider important but often neglected effects, such as inertial acceleration (centrifugal and Coriolis). In this paper, after presenting in detail the principle of the model, we focus on preliminary results showing the original contribution of this new model. For these first runs, we simulate the convection and corotation transport of closed flux tubes in the plasmasphere for tilted/eccentric dipolar magnetic field configuration in solstice and equinox conditions. We follow different flux tubes between 1.2 and 6 Earth Radii (R<SUB>E</SUB>) and demonstrate the capability of the model to describe a wide range of density (above 15 orders of magnitude). The relevance of the mathematical approach used is highlighted, as anisotropies can develop above 3000 km in the plasmasphere as a result of the mirroring effect related to the anisotropic pressure tensor. Moreover, we show that the addition of inertial acceleration may become critical to describe plasma interhemispheric transport above 4R<SUB>E</SUB>. The ability of the model to describe the external plasmasphere is demonstrated, and innovative studies are foreseen, regarding the dynamics of the plasma along the magnetic field lines (in particular interhemispheric exchanges and \"opening\"/\"closure\" of a flux tube).",

Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is required to understand its role in energy redistribution in the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In previous theoretical descriptions of precipitated magnetospheric electrons (E\u223c 1 keV), the major focus has been the ionization and excitation rates of the neutral atmosphere and the energy deposition rate to thermal ionospheric electrons. However, these precipitating electrons will also produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. This paper presents the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E&lt; 600 eV) and their ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling processes. In this article, we discuss for the first time how diffuse electron precipitation into the atmosphere and the associated secondary electron production participate in ionosphere-magnetosphere energy redistribution.",

Typically, models of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling include changes to ionospheric conductance driven by extreme ultraviolet ionization and electron precipitation. This paper shows that effects driven by the Farley-Buneman instability can also create significant enhancements in the ionospheric conductance, with substantial impacts on geospace. We have implemented a method of including electrojet turbulence (ET) effects into the ionospheric conductance model utilized within geospace simulations. Our particular implementation is tested with simulations of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global magnetosphere model coupled with the Rice Convection Model of the inner magnetosphere. We examine the impact of including ET-modified conductances in a case study of the geomagnetic storm of 17 March 2013. Simulations with ET show a 13% reduction in the cross polar cap potential at the beginning of the storm and up to 20% increases in the Pedersen and Hall conductance. These simulation results show better agreement with Defense Meteorological Satellite Program observations, including capturing features of subauroral polarization streams. The field-aligned current (FAC) patterns show little differences during the peak of storm and agree well with Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) reconstructions. Typically, the simulated FAC densities are stronger and at slightly higher latitudes than shown by AMPERE. The inner magnetospheric pressures derived from Tsyganenko-Sitnov empirical magnetic field model show that the inclusion of the ET effects increases the peak pressure and brings the results into better agreement with the empirical model.",

         "abstract": "Pi2 driving has been the subject of long standing debate involving magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Using the THEMIS ground-based all-sky imager array, we have examined auroral disturbances evolving in the Pi2 frequency range to help identify where the Pi2 signal propagates from the magnetosphere toward the ionosphere. We demonstrate that expansion-phase intensifications near the poleward edge of the auroral bulge occur quasiperiodically with one-to-one correspondence to Pi2 pulses, neither being strictly periodic. The expansion-phase intensifications propagate toward the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval, and then often turn azimuthally. Based on the known relation between auroral streamers and plasma sheet flow bursts, the presence of the quasiperiodic streamers indicates that substorm Pi2s are driven by multiple plasma sheet flow bursts, each driving a Pi2 pulse. While it is difficult to tell precisely when auroral zone Pi2 starts because of the modest onset-related negative bays, we found that midlatitude-equatorial Pi2 tends to start a few minutes after initial substorm auroral onset, and that each Pi2 pulse starts to rise simultaneously over a wide latitude range from the auroral zone to the magnetic dip equator as well as over a wide longitudinal range. The observations furthermore show that auroral zone Pi2 near the streamer meridian is anti-correlated with midlatitude-equatorial Pi2. These features can be explained by an oscillating current wedge, whose upward field-aligned current (FAC) corresponds to the auroral streamers. The midlatitude-equatorial Pi2 is likely caused by the FACs of the current wedge, and the oscillating westward electrojet creates the auroral zone Pi2.",

         "abstract": "Ionospheric heavy ions play an important role in the dynamics of Earth's magnetosphere. The greater mass and gyroradius of ionospheric oxygen differentiates its behavior from protons at the same energies. Oxygen may have an impact on tail reconnection processes, and it can at least temporarily dominate the energy content of the ring current during geomagnetic storms. At sub-keV energies, multispecies ion populations in the inner magnetosphere form the warm plasma cloak, occupying the energy range between the plasmasphere and the ring current. Lastly, cold lighter ions from the midlatitude ionosphere create the corotating plasmasphere whose outer regions can interact with the plasma cloak, plasma sheet, ring current, and outer electron belt. In this paper we present a statistical view of warm, cloak-like ion populations in the inner magnetosphere, contrasting, in particular, the warm plasma composition during quiet and active times. We study the relative abundances and absolute densities of warm plasma measured by the Van Allen Probes, whose two spacecraft cover the inner magnetosphere from plasmaspheric altitudes close to Earth to just inside geostationary orbit. We observe that warm (&gt;30 eV) oxygen is most abundant closer to the plasmasphere boundary, whereas warm hydrogen dominates closer to geostationary orbit. Warm helium is usually a minor constituent but shows a noticeable enhancement in the near-Earth dusk sector.",

         "abstract": "We investigate, for the first time with a spatial superposed epoch analysis study, the thermosphere global time response to 159 geomagnetic storms caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed in the solar wind at Earth's orbit during the period of September 2001 to September 2011. The thermosphere neutral mass density is obtained from the CHAMP (CHAllenge Mini-Satellite Payload) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery Climate Experiment) spacecraft. All density measurements are intercalibrated against densities computed by the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 empirical model under the regime of very low geomagnetic activity. We explore both the effects of the pre-CME shock impact on the thermosphere and of the storm main phase onset by taking their times of occurrence as zero epoch times (CME impact and interplanetary magnetic field B<SUB>z</SUB> southward turning) for each storm. We find that the shock impact produces quick and transient responses at the two high-latitude regions with minimal propagation toward lower latitudes. In both cases, thermosphere is heated in very high latitude regions within several minutes. The B<SUB>z</SUB> southward turning of the storm onset has a fast heating manifestation at the two high-latitude regions, and it takes approximately 3 h for that heating to propagate down to equatorial latitudes and to globalize in the thermosphere. This heating propagation is presumably accomplished, at least in part, with traveling atmospheric disturbances and complex meridional wind structures. Current models use longer lag times in computing thermosphere density dynamics during storms. Our results suggest that the thermosphere response time scales are shorter and should be accordingly adjusted in thermospheric empirical models.",

         "abstract": "Magnetospheric substorms represent a major energy release process in Earth's magnetosphere. Their duration and intensity are coupled to solar wind input, but the precise way the solar wind energy is stored and then released is a matter of considerable debate. Part of the observational difficulty has been the gaps in the auroral electrojet index traditionally used to study substorm properties. In this study, we created a midlatitude positive bay (MPB) index to measure the strength of the substorm current wedge. Because this index is based on midlatitude magnetometer data that are available continuously over several decades, we can assemble a database of substorm onsets lasting 31 years (1982-2012). We confirmed that the MPB onsets have a good agreement (\u00b12 min) with auroral onsets as determined by optical means on board the IMAGE mission and that the MPB signature of substorms is robust and independent of the stations' position relative to ionospheric currents. Using the MPB onset, expansion, and recovery as a proxy of the respective substorm quantities, we found that the solar cycle variation of substorm occurrence depends on solar wind conditions and has a most probable value of 80 min. In contrast, the durations of substorm expansion and recovery phases do not change with the solar cycle. This suggests that the frequency of energy unloading in the magnetosphere is controlled by solar wind conditions through dayside reconnection, but the unloading process related to flux pileup in the near-Earth region is controlled by the magnetosphere and independent of external driving.",

To fully understand the formation of this flux at the upper ionospheric boundary, \u223c700-800 km, it is important to consider the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In the diffuse aurora, precipitating electrons initially injected from the plasma sheet via wave-particle interaction processes degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These precipitating electrons can be additionally reflected upward from the two conjugate ionospheres, leading to a series of multiple reflections through the magnetosphere. These reflections greatly influence the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km) and the resultant population of secondary electrons and electrons cascading toward lower energies. In this paper, we present the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E &lt; 600 eV) and its energy interplay in the magnetosphere and two conjugated ionospheres. This solution takes into account, for the first time, the formation of the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region, beginning with the primary injection of plasma sheet electrons via both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves and whistler mode chorus waves to the loss cone, and including their subsequent multiple atmospheric reflections in the two magnetically conjugated ionospheres. It is demonstrated that magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is key in forming the electron distribution function in the diffuse auroral region.",

         "abstract": "A critical, long-standing problem in substorm research is identification of the sequence of events leading to substorm expansion phase onset. Recent Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imager (ASI) array observations have shown a repeatable preonset sequence, which is initiated by a poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and is followed by auroral streamers moving equatorward (earthward flow in the plasma sheet) and then by substorm onset. On the other hand, substorm onset is also preceded by azimuthally propagating waves, indicating a possible importance of wave instability for triggering substorm onset. However, it has been difficult to identify the link between fast flows and waves. We have found an isolated substorm event that was well instrumented with the Poker Flat incoherent scatter radar (PFISR), THEMIS white-light ASI, and multispectral ASI, where the auroral onset occurred within the PFISR and ASI fields of view. This substorm onset was preceded by a PBI, and ionospheric flows propagated equatorward from the polar cap, crossed the PBI, and reached the growth phase arc. This sequence provides evidence that flows from open magnetic field lines propagate across the open-closed boundary and reach the near-Earth plasma sheet prior to the onset. Quasi-stable oscillations in auroral luminosity and ionospheric density are found along the growth phase arc. These preonset auroral waves amplified abruptly at the onset time, soon after the equatorward flows reached the onset region. This sequence suggests a coupling process where preexisting stable waves in the near-Earth plasma sheet interact with flows from farther downtail and then evolve to onset instability.",

The density trough inside the plasmasphere with a width of \u223c0.7 R<SUB>E</SUB> in terms of L shell (from L \u223c 2.3 to L \u223c 3.0) was observed in situ by RPI when IMAGE traversed the plasmasphere in \u223c2130 magnetic local time (MLT) sector. The plasmasphere images taken by the IMAGE EUV instrument confirm that the density trough is inside the plasmasphere. A 2-D electron density image constructed from the RPI active sounding measurements reveals that the density trough extends along the magnetic field from the IMAGE orbit to at least 41\u00b0 magnetic latitude. Meanwhile, the DMSP-F15 satellite, circling the Earth at about 850 km altitude, detected a light ion density trough at the same time on the same L shells and similar MLT sector. The coordinated observations with the IMAGE and DMSP-F15 satellite demonstrate, for the first time, that the density trough is a low-density plasmaspheric structure extending from the plasmasphere to the topside ionosphere along the geomagnetic field lines.",

The relative importance of different plasma entry mechanisms and pathways is largely determined by the solar wind conditions. Therefore, the spatial and temporal dependence of magnetotail plasma and field properties under different kinds of solar wind conditions is critically important for understanding the Earth's magnetosphere. This study presents a statistical study of fundamental magnetotail plasma properties in a normalized reference frame by utilizing 12+ years of data from NASA's Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission. These statistical maps are mostly in agreement with the magnetosheath of MHD runs from the CCMC BATS-R-US model, but some features in the maps can be explained by kinetic particle physics, not present in the MHD. The results are also used to investigate the presence of any magnetotail plasma parameter asymmetries and their possible causes.",

We aim to explain why the observed longitudinal structures of the QTDOs in the ionosphere are different from those of the QTDWs in the MLT. We find that large QTDOs in the ionosphere with zonal wavenumbers other than W3 occur in the model run with the true magnetic field, but not in the model run with an aligned dipole field. These numerical experiments suggest that the occurrence of the additional zonal wavenumbers in ionospheric QTDOs is related to the longitudinal variations of the Earth's magnetic field configuration, strength, and dip angle, which have distinct stationary zonal wavenumbers. We also find that when the specified W3 QTDW winds drive ionospheric plasma motion in the magnetic field, the resultant QTDOs in ionospheric parameters, such as the dynamo electric field, ion vertical drifts, plasma densities, and total electron content, have more complicated longitudinal variations than simply W3, corresponding to a zonal wavenumber broadening effect. Additionally, we find that the wavenumber broadening effect in the ionosphere can be fed back onto the neutrals through ion drag, to produce small QTDW winds with new wavenumbers in the thermosphere.",

The optical pulsations are at times locally interrupted or drowned out by auroral substorm activity but are observed in the same location once the discrete aurora recedes. The pulsations following the auroral breakup appear to be brighter and have a larger patch size than before breakup. This suggests that, while the onset of pulsating aurora is not necessarily dependent upon a substorm precursor, the pulsations are affected and possibly enhanced by the substorm process. The long duration of this pulsating aurora event, lasting approximately 8 h without interruption as imaged from Gillam station, is significantly longer than the typical 2-3 h substorm recovery phase, suggesting that pulsating aurora is not strictly a recovery phase phenomenon. This paper is accompanied by a movie of the THEMIS ASI array data, from 0000 to 1715 UT, plotted in mosaic and superimposed onto a map of North America.",

         "abstract": "The extreme substorm event on 5 April 2010 (THEMIS AL = -2,700 nT, called supersubstorm) was investigated to examine its driving processes, the aurora current system responsible for the supersubstorm, and the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (M-I-T) responses. An interplanetary shock created shock aurora, but the shock was not a direct driver of the supersubstorm onset. Instead, the shock with a large southward IMF strengthened the growth phase with substantially larger ionosphere currents, more rapid equatorward motion of the auroral oval, larger ionosphere conductance, and more elevated magnetotail pressure than those for the growth phase of classical substorms. The auroral brightening at the supersubstorm onset was small, but the expansion phase had multistep enhancements of unusually large auroral brightenings and electrojets. The largest activity was an extremely large poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and subsequent auroral streamer, which started ~20 min after the substorm auroral onset during a steady southward IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> and elevated dynamic pressure. Those were associated with a substorm current wedge (SCW), plasma sheet flow, relativistic particle injection and precipitation down to the D-region, total electron content (TEC), conductance, and neutral wind in the thermosphere, all of which were unusually large compared to classical substorms. The SCW did not extend over the entire nightside auroral activity but was localized azimuthally to a few 100 km in the ionosphere around the PBI and streamer. These results reveal the importance of localized magnetotail reconnection for releasing large energy accumulation that can affect geosynchronous satellites and produce the extreme M-I-T responses.",

We study the response of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system to a 25% reduction in magnetic field intensity, using the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (CMIT) model. Simulations were performed with a dipole moment of 8 \u00d7 10<SUP>22</SUP> A m<SUP>2</SUP>, close to the present-day value, and a dipole moment of 6 \u00d7 10<SUP>22</SUP> A m<SUP>2</SUP>, both under the same solar wind conditions, intermediate solar activity (F10.7 = 150), and for March equinox and June solstice. The 25% reduction in field strength causes the magnetosphere to shrink and the polar cap to expand, in agreement with theory. The Pedersen and the Hall ionospheric conductances increase by 50%-60% and 60%-65%, respectively. This causes a \u223c9%-12% decrease in electric potential and a \u223c20% increase in field-aligned currents during equinox. Ion E \u00d7 B drift velocities are enhanced by \u223c10%-15%. The Joule heating also increases, by 13%-30%, depending on the season. Changes in the neutral temperature structure are caused partly by changes in Joule heating and partly by changes in the neutral wind. The neutral wind itself is also affected by changes in neutral temperature and by changes in ion velocities. The changes in the neutral wind, together with changes in the vertical component of the E \u00d7 B drift, affect the height of the ionospheric F2 layer. Changes in electron density are related to changes in the O/N<SUB>2</SUB> ratio. The global mean increase in neutral temperature causes the thermosphere to expand, resulting in a global mean uplift of the ionosphere. These effects are generally smaller during solstice.",

         "abstract": "The azimuthal plasma pressure gradient in the near-Earth plasma sheet makes crucial contributions to field-aligned current (FAC) formation. Numerical simulations and statistical observations have shown that a plasma pressure peak tends to build up in the premidnight region of the near-Earth plasma sheet during the substorm growth phase owing to enhanced magnetic drift. This leads to azimuthal pressure gradients in this region. The temporal variation of the azimuthal pressure gradient may provide an indication for the FAC variations associated with the substorm growth phase and may set up a plasma sheet precondition for the substorm onset being triggered near this region. We take advantage of two of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft separated azimuthally near the orbit apogee and investigate the azimuthal plasma pressure gradient before substorm onset in the R \u223c10-12 R<SUB>E</SUB> region. Equatorial plasma pressure is estimated by removing the curvature force effect. Five events with the spacecraft footprints mapped very close to the aurora onset region were selected. These events show substantial duskward pressure gradient enhancement 1-5 min before onset. The onset arc, which results from enhanced energetic electron precipitation, was found to intensify simultaneously with the pressure gradient enhancement before onset breakup occurs. Since the energy and energy flux of precipitating electrons reflect the upward FAC strength, these results indicate that the duskward azimuthal pressure gradient enhancement is associated with enhanced upward FAC during the late growth phase and leads to the intensification of the onset auroral arc soon before it breaks up. It is possible that this pressure gradient enhancement may lead to ballooning mode instability and thus substorm onset along the intensifying arc.",

         "abstract": "fast flows that impinge on the inner magnetosphere from the plasma sheet are observed to oscillate on time scales of minutes. The compression ahead of these flows will launch fast mode waves, while the velocity shears at the edges of these flows directly excite shear Alfv\u00e9n waves. These waves, which are coupled by gradients in the Alfv\u00e9n speed, have been suggested as a source for the Pi1 and Pi2 waves that are observed at both high and low latitudes in the ionosphere. A new three-dimensional simulation of the propagation of ULF waves in the dipolar region of the magnetosphere has been developed to study these coupled wave modes. This model includes a height-resolved ionospheric conductivity so that ionospheric fields can be more realistically determined, as well as a direct calculation of ground magnetic fields to compare with ground magnetometers using an inductive ionosphere model. Results from this model show that a plasmaspheric resonance can be set up by waves with periods about 1 min and that field line resonances can be excited both inside and outside the plasmasphere. The use of the inductive ionosphere model leads to the conclusion that even a uniform Hall conductivity can break the dawn-dusk symmetry of the convection pattern. Waves from a source at 10 Earth radii reach the ionosphere with time delays between high and low latitudes of tens of seconds, with implications for the timing of substorm phenomena observed by spacecraft and by ground magnetometers and radars.",

We find that the flapping motion generally comprises contributions both from a nonpropagating steady flapping and a propagating kink-like flapping. The flapping motion tilts the current sheet normal significantly in the plane perpendicular to the Venus-Sun line. The kink-like flapping waves traveling along solar wind electric field or its antidirection can be found in either magnetotail hemisphere where solar wind electric field pointing toward/away. The traveling behaviors suggest that the locations of the triggers for kink-like flappings are near the boundaries between magnetotail current sheet and magnetosheath, not near the central region of magnetotail as is for the Earth's magnetotail.",

         "abstract": "The ionization of neutral material ejected by Jupiter's volcanically active moon, Io, results in a plasma disc that extends from Io's orbit out through the Jovian magnetosphere. This magnetospheric plasma is coupled to the planetary ionosphere via currents which flow along the magnetic field. Inside of \u223c40 R<SUB>J</SUB>, these currents transfer angular momentum from the planet to the magnetospheric plasma, in an attempt to keep the plasma rigidly corotating with the planet. Jupiter's main auroral emission is a signature of this current system. To date, one-dimensional models of Jupiter's magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling have either assumed a dipole field or used a field description appropriate to the postmidnight region of the Jovian magnetosphere. Vogt et al. (2011) described the variation of the N-S component of the magnetic field in the center of the current sheet, B<SUB>N</SUB>, with local time and radius. We apply a 1-D model of Jupiter's M-I current system every hour in local time using a modified description of the Vogt et al. (2011) magnetic field to investigate how local time variations in the magnetosphere affect the auroral currents and plasma angular velocity. Our model predicts the strongest aurora at dawn, with a minimum in the auroral currents existing from noon through dusk. This is a few hours duskward of the discontinuity predicted by Radioti et al. (2008). While our model predictions are consistent with some of the observations, future MI coupling models must account for the azimuthal bendback in the magnetic field.",

Here we consider generation mechanisms of \"dispersionless\" injections, namely, those with simultaneous increase of the particle flux over a wide energy range. In this study we take advantage of multisatellite observations which simultaneously monitor Earth's magnetospheric dynamics from the tail toward the radiation belts during a substorm event. Dispersionless injections are associated with instabilities in the plasma sheet during the growth phase of the substorm, with a dipolarization front at the onset and with magnetic flux pileup during the expansion phase. They show different spatial spread and propagation characteristics. Injection associated with the dipolarization front is the most penetrating. At geosynchronous orbit (6.6 R<SUB>E</SUB>), the electron distributions do not have a classic power law fit but instead a bump on tail centered on \u223c120 keV during dispersionless electron injections. However, electron distributions of injections associated with magnetic flux pileup in the magnetotail (13 R<SUB>E</SUB>) do not show such a signature. We surmise that an additional resonant acceleration occurs in between these locations. We relate the acceleration mechanism to the electron drift resonance with ultralow frequency waves localized in the inner magnetosphere.",

Neutral hydrogen density is a key parameter that controls soft X-ray emission and can be inversely extracted from the soft X-ray observations. We introduce a unique method to estimate the dayside neutral density by using X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM)-Newton astrophysics X-ray observations and Open Geospace Global Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) global magnetosphere-ionosphere magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. On 4 May 2003 and 16 October 2001, the XMM-Newton line of sight traversed the dayside of the Earth's magnetosheath and observed strong near-Earth soft X-ray emission. We simulate these two events using the OpenGGCM model. Although the model tends to produce a spatially thicker magnetosheath than measured, modeled magnetosheath plasma fluxes match well with the in situ observations of Cluster and Geotail. We calculate the neutral densities every thousand seconds by comparing the modeled count rates with the XMM-Newton rates. The densities are averaged at 39.9 \u00b1 8.0 and 57.6 \u00b1 8.0 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> for the 4 May 2003 and 16 October 2001 events, respectively. Since our MHD tends to underestimate neutral densities due to its thicker magnetosheath, the true neutral density is likely to lie within the upper half of these error bars.",

         "abstract": "Thermosphere densities from the CHAMP and GRACE satellites are utilized, for the first time, to study the recovery of the thermosphere as a function of latitude during the October 2003 storms. Our results show that the relaxation times, defined by the e-folding time of the poststorm recovery of thermosphere density, are about 6 and 8 h for two recovery phases of the October 2003 superstorms, respectively. Geomagnetic activity index Kp or ring current index Dst is incapable of describing the rapid recovery of thermosphere density. Moreover, a weak altitudinal dependence of the relaxation times was observed between the CHAMP and GRACE altitudes at middle and high latitudes, but no coherent latitudinal dependence was found. The MSISE00 and TIEGCM neutral densities are compared with the observations to assess their capability in predicting the thermosphere response during the recovery phase of extremely severe storms. Neither the MSISE00 nor the TIEGCM reproduced the rapid recovery of thermosphere densities seen in the CHAMP and GRACE, although the TIEGCM captured most of the salient features observed by CHAMP and GRACE when AMIE convection and precipitation patterns were used to specify the high-latitude drivers. The relaxation times of the MSISE00 and TIEGCM nighttime densities at 390 km are generally longer than those from the CHAMP observations by about 4 h, and even longer in the geographic latitudinal range of 25\u00b0N-50\u00b0N. The TIEGCM recovery times of thermosphere density are shorter on the dayside than on the nightside, whereas the MSISE00 densities show substantially longer relaxation times at low latitudes. Thus, not only are the relaxation times of the MSISE00 and TIEGCM densities longer than observed in the CHAMP and GRACE data, but they also show much larger day-night differences. No clear explanation can be found to fully understand the causes for the slower recovery of the thermosphere density simulated by the TIEGCM.",

Through the use of a generalized multicomponent fitting routine to the full 3-D distribution function, we distinguish magnetosheath ions from magnetospheric and diffuse energetic ion populations through these regions. From this approach, we find that the energy density of magnetosheath ions is well correlated with the spectral energy density of electromagnetic field fluctuations on gyro-radius scales. Through a dispersion analysis, we demonstrate that these field structures have the properties of kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves. We show that the heating provided by these waves is nearly entirely perpendicular to the magnetic field and, subject to a threshold condition being exceeded, occurs at a rate that is lognormally distributed as 10<SUP>-0.3\u00b11.1</SUP> eVs<SUP>-1</SUP> or on average ~1 eVs<SUP>-1</SUP>. This rapid perpendicular heating is shown in turn to be limited by the threshold condition for anisotropy instabilities which when exceeded leads to further wave emission and the transfer of perpendicular energy to parallel particle energy. We suggest that this cycle of wave emission and heating may be expected to slow magnetosheath flow while driving irreversible changes in magnetosheath ion distributions.",

         "abstract": "To understand the relationship between generation of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves and energetic particle injections, we performed a statistical study of EMIC waves associated with and without injections based on the Van Allen Probes (Radiation Belt Storm Probes) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES; GOES-13 and GOES-15) observations. Using 47 months of observations, we identified wave events seen by the Van Allen Probes relative to the plasmapause and to energetic particle injections seen by GOES-13 and GOES-15 on the nightside. We separated the events into four categories: EMIC waves with (without) injections inside (outside) the plasmasphere. We found that He<SUP>+</SUP> EMIC waves have higher occurrence rate inside the plasmasphere, while H<SUP>+</SUP> EMIC waves predominantly occur outside the plasmasphere. Meanwhile, the time duration and peak occurrence rate of EMIC waves associated with injections are shorter and limited to a narrower magnetic local time region than those without injections, indicating that these waves have localized source regions. He<SUP>+</SUP> EMIC waves inside the plasmasphere associated with injection are usually accompanied by an increase in H<SUP>+</SUP> flux within energies of 1-50 keV through all magnetic local time regions, while most wave events outside the plasmasphere show less relationship with H<SUP>+</SUP> flux increase. From these observations, we suggest that injected hot ions are the major driver of He<SUP>+</SUP> EMIC waves inside the plasmasphere during active time. Expanding plasmasphere during quiet times can provide broad wave source regions for He<SUP>+</SUP> EMIC waves on the dayside. However, H<SUP>+</SUP> EMIC waves outside the plasmasphere show different characteristics, suggesting that these waves are generated by other processes.",

The observed oxygen ion temperature and flow energy indicate that the outflow is marginally stable to ion acoustic wave generation: The oxygen temperature is slightly lower than the electron temperature and slightly higher than the oxygen flow energy. Moreover, the observed outflows are accompanied by low frequency electrostatic waves that may contribute to outflow thermalization. The oxygen bulk velocity has a significant component directed toward the equatorial plane, originating from the cross-field drift in the convection electric field.

         "abstract": "The intraseasonal variability of the eastward propagating nonmigrating diurnal tide with zonal wave number 3 (DE3) during 2007 in the mesosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere is investigated using a whole atmosphere model reanalysis and satellite observations. The atmospheric reanalysis is based on implementation of data assimilation in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. The tidal variability in the WACCM+DART reanalysis is compared to the observed variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) based on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics satellite Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (TIMED/SABER) observations, in the ionosphere based on Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations, and in the upper thermosphere (\u223c475 km) based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density observations. To obtain the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT and upper thermosphere, we apply the method of tidal deconvolution to the TIMED/SABER observations and consider the difference in the ascending and descending longitudinal wave number 4 structure in the GRACE observations. The results reveal that tidal amplitude changes of 5-10 K regularly occur on short timescales (\u223c10-20 days) in the MLT. Similar variability occurs in the WACCM+DART reanalysis and TIMED/SABER observations, demonstrating that the short-term variability can be captured in whole atmosphere models that employ data assimilation and in observations by the technique of tidal deconvolution. The impact of the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT on the ionosphere and thermosphere is also clearly evident in the COSMIC and GRACE observations. Analysis of the troposphere forcing in WACCM+DART and simulations of the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) show that the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT is not related to a single source; rather, it is due to a combination of changes in troposphere forcing, zonal mean atmosphere, and wave-wave interactions.",

The present study investigates the source of the global N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> decrease by performing numerical experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model. The simulations reveal that the N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> reduction coincides with a depletion of thermospheric [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>], indicating that the N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> depletion is related to changes in thermospheric composition during SSWs. Numerical experiments further illustrate that the short-term (\u223c10 day) enhancement of the migrating semidiurnal solar tide (SW2) during SSWs is the source of the variability in thermospheric composition. In particular, the enhancement of the SW2 during SSWs alters the lower thermosphere zonal mean circulation, leading to a reduction in atomic oxygen in the lower thermosphere. The atomic oxygen reduction propagates into the upper thermosphere through molecular diffusion, leading to a decrease in [O]/[N<SUB>2</SUB>] throughout the low- to middle-latitude thermosphere. It is anticipated that the effects of the SW2 on the ionosphere and thermosphere investigated herein will be modulated by SSW related enhancements of the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M2). The magnitude of the combined impact of the SW2 and M2 on the ionosphere-thermosphere mean state will depend on the relative phasing of the solar and lunar tides. The results demonstrate that in addition to modulating the low-latitude electrodynamics, tidal variability during SSWs can significantly impact the mean state of the ionosphere and thermosphere.",

         "abstract": "It is now well established that the ionosphere, because it acts as a significant source of plasma, plays a critical role in ring current dynamics. However, because the ring current deposits energy into the ionosphere, the inverse may also be true: the ring current can play a critical role in the dynamics of ionospheric outflow. This study uses a set of coupled, first-principles-based numerical models to test the dependence of ionospheric outflow on ring current-driven region 2 field-aligned currents (FACs). A moderate magnetospheric storm event is modeled with the Space Weather Modeling Framework using a global MHD code (Block Adaptive Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme, BATS-R-US), a polar wind model (Polar Wind Outflow Model), and a bounce-averaged kinetic ring current model (ring current atmosphere interaction model with self-consistent magnetic field, RAM-SCB). Initially, each code is two-way coupled to all others except for RAM-SCB, which receives inputs from the other models but is not allowed to feed back pressure into the MHD model. The simulation is repeated with pressure coupling activated, which drives strong pressure gradients and region 2 FACs in BATS-R-US. It is found that the region 2 FACs increase heavy ion outflow by up to 6 times over the noncoupled results. The additional outflow further energizes the ring current, establishing an ionosphere-magnetosphere mass feedback loop. This study further demonstrates that ionospheric outflow is not merely a plasma source for the magnetosphere but an integral part in the nonlinear ionosphere-magnetosphere-ring current system.",

         "abstract": "Earthward-propagating dipolarization fronts (DFs) are often found to be associated with magnetic reconnection and bursty bulk flows (BBFs) in the magnetotail. Recent THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms) probe observations have shown a DF propagating over 10 R<SUB>E</SUB> from the mid-tail region to the near-Earth tail region, and THEMIS All-Sky Imager data show a north-south auroral form and intensification of westward auroral zone currents. In this study, we examine THEMIS in situ observations of DFs in the magnetotail and simultaneous observations of the proton aurora from ground-based CANOPUS (the Canadian Auroral Network for the OPEN Program Unified Study) Meridian Scanning Photometers (MSPs). We find that earthward-moving DFs are often associated with intensification of proton aurora when the THEMIS probes are conjugate to the meridian of the MSP. The proton auroral intensifications are transient and in some cases detached from the background proton precipitation. Just before the DFs, the ion distribution is anisotropic in the field-aligned direction (mostly earthward) and the ion energy increases. These observations suggest that plasma sheet protons can be reflected and energized by earthward-moving DFs as they propagate through the magnetotail. We postulate that this population of ions is the source of the proton auroral intensification observed on the ground. This conjecture is tested using our global MHD simulation results, where the proton precipitation is calculated with the field-line curvature (FLC) model. The MHD simulation results show that proton precipitation enhancement can be caused by compression of plasma by approaching DFs/BBFs, which is consistent with ion reflection at DFs. Thus, using the conjugate observations from THEMIS spacecraft and MSP in this study, we are able to directly link the magnetotail dynamics, i.e., dipolarization fronts, with ground auroral activities. However, understanding of DF-associated ion energization requires detailed test-particle simulations with an analytical magnetotail model, such as those in our companion paper.",

         "abstract": "Magnetospheric whistler mode emissions (chorus and hiss) can play an important role in acceleration and loss of energetic electrons by wave-particle interaction. Here we present a first report of two events in the simultaneous observations of chorus and hiss by the Cluster constellation. During the event of 30 August 2001, one spacecraft observed chorus in the plasmasphere boundary layer (PBL), and three spacecraft observed hiss in the plasmasphere. In the event of 18 November 2002, one Cluster spacecraft observed hiss inside the plasmasphere, and the other three spacecraft observed chorus outside the plasmasphere. The correlation between chorus and hiss waves in both events are analyzed via intensity comparison and cross-correlation analysis. It is found that chorus and hiss waves have significant correlation in the first event but have no correlation in the second event. Furthermore, we perform a ray-tracing study to investigate the correlation by adopting two typical density models: the MTotal density model associated with the PBL structure and the global core density model. Simulation results demonstrate that chorus waves outside the plasmapause can propagate into the plasmasphere and possibly evolve into hiss waves under the MTotal density model, supporting the previous finding that the plasmaspheric hiss may originate from discrete chorus emission. However, chorus cannot travel into the plasmasphere under the global core density model. This paper presents a first result that chorus has more opportunity to propagate into the plasmasphere through the PBL than through the plasmapause. The results suggest that the gradual density variation of the PBL appears to favor the inward propagation of whistler mode waves.",

         "abstract": "The subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) is an important magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling phenomenon that impacts a range of particle populations in the inner magnetosphere. SAPS studies often emphasize ionospheric signatures of fast westward flows, but the equatorial magnetosphere is also affected through strong radial electric fields in the dusk sector. This study focuses on a period of steady southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) during the 29 June 2013 geomagnetic storm where the Van Allen Probes observe a region of intense electric fields near the plasmapause over multiple consecutive outbound duskside passes. We show that the large-amplitude electric fields near the equatorial plane are consistent with SAPS by investigating the relationship between plasma sheet ion and electron boundaries, associated field-aligned currents, and the spatial location of the electric fields. By incorporating high-inclination DMSP data we demonstrate the spatial and temporal variability of the SAPS region, and we suggest that discrete, earthward propagating injections are driving the observed strong electric fields at low L shells in the equatorial magnetosphere. We also show the relationship between SAPS and plasmasphere erosion, as well as a possible correlation with flux enhancements for 100s keV electrons.",

We demonstrate that the electric field and Poynting flux reaching the magnetopause are not linear functions of the electric field and Poynting flux observed in the solar wind: the electric field and Poynting flux at the magnetopause during higher driving conditions are lower than those predicted from a linear function. We also show that the Poynting flux normal to the magnetopause is linearly correlated with the directly driven part of the auroral electrojets in the ionosphere. This indicates that the energy entering the magnetosphere in the form of the Poynting flux is directly responsible for driving the electrojets. Furthermore, we argue that the polar cap potential saturation discussed in the literature is associated with the way solar wind plasma gets processed during the bow shock crossing and motion within the magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "It is well known that auroral patterns at the substorm recovery phase are characterized by diffuse or patch structures with intensity pulsation. According to satellite measurements and simulation studies, the precipitating electrons associated with these aurorae can reach or exceed energies of a few hundreds of keV through resonant wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere. However, because of difficulty of simultaneous measurements, the dependency of energetic electron precipitation (EEP) on auroral morphological changes in the mesoscale has not been investigated to date. In order to study this dependency, we have analyzed data from the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar, the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array (KAIRA) riometer, collocated cameras, ground-based magnetometers, the Van Allen Probe satellites, Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), and the Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt (Dynamic) Deposition-VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortium (AARDDVARK). Here we undertake a detailed examination of two case studies. The selected two events suggest that the highest energy of EEP on those days occurred with auroral patch formation from postmidnight to dawn, coinciding with the substorm onset at local midnight. Measurements of the EISCAT radar showed ionization as low as 65 km altitude, corresponding to EEP with energies of about 500 keV.&lt;abstract type=\"synopsis\"&gt;&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Plain Language SummaryAurora is emission of the atmospheric particles excited by electrons coming from the magnetosphere. The electrons have energies of 1-10 keV or higher. In particular, it is known that the energy can increase more than 100 keV in association with the pulsating aurora and that morphology of the pulsating aurora changes with time. However, relationships between the energy increase and the morphological change have not been studied well. This study analyzed the ionospheric density and auroral images and found that significant increases of the energy coincides with evolution of the patch structures in the pulsating aurora.",

         "abstract": "With a thermosphere-ionosphere Fe/Fe<SUP>+</SUP> (TIFe) model developed from first principles at the University of Colorado, we present the first quantitative investigation of formation mechanisms of thermospheric Fe layers observed by lidar in Antarctica. These recently discovered neutral metal layers in the thermosphere between 100 and 200 km provide unique tracers for studies of fundamental processes in the space-atmosphere interaction region. The TIFe model formulates and expands the TIFe theory originally proposed by Chu et al. that the thermospheric Fe layers are produced through the neutralization of converged Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers. Through testing mechanisms and reproducing the 28 May 2011 event at McMurdo, we conceive the lifecycle of meteoric metals via deposition, transport, chemistry, and wave dynamics for thermospheric Fe layers with gravity wave signatures. While the meteor injection of iron species is negligible above 120 km, the polar electric field transports metallic ions Fe<SUP>+</SUP> upward from their main deposition region into the E-F regions, providing the major source of Fe<SUP>+</SUP> (and accordingly Fe) in the thermosphere. Atmospheric wave-induced vertical shears of vertical and horizontal winds converge Fe<SUP>+</SUP> to form dense Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers. Direct electron-Fe<SUP>+</SUP> recombination is the major channel to neutralize Fe<SUP>+</SUP> layers to form Fe above 120 km. Fe layer shapes are determined by multiple factors of neutral winds, electric field, and aurora activity. Gravity-wave-induced vertical wind plays a key role in forming gravity-wave-shaped Fe layers. Aurora particle precipitation enhances Fe<SUP>+</SUP> neutralization by increasing electron density while accelerating Fe loss via charge transfer with enhanced NO<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> densities.&lt;abstract type=\"synopsis\"&gt;&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Plain Language SummaryThe discoveries of neutral metal layers reaching near 200 km in the thermosphere have significant scientific merit because such discoveries challenge the current understandings of upper atmospheric composition, chemistry, dynamics, electrodynamics, and energetics. Furthermore, these neutral metal layers provide tracers for direct measurements of the neutral properties in the least understood but crucially important space-atmosphere interaction region in the altitude range of 100-200 km. With a thermosphere-ionosphere Fe/Fe<SUP>+</SUP> (TIFe) model developed from first principles at the University of Colorado, we present the first quantitative investigation of formation mechanisms of thermospheric Fe layers observed by lidar in Antarctica. The TIFe model formulates the TIFe theory depicting the lifecycle of meteoric metals via deposition, transport, chemistry, and wave dynamics. Antarctic lidar observations were successfully reproduced with the TIFe model simulations. These TIFe layers provide a unique natural laboratory for understanding the fundamental processes critical to advancing the research of space-atmosphere interactions.",

         "abstract": "Cassini magnetic field observations between 2004 and 2012 suggest the ambient field conditions near Titan's orbit to differ significantly from the frequently applied pre-Cassini picture (background magnetic field homogeneous and perpendicular to Titan's orbital plane, stationary upstream conditions). In this study, we analyze the impact of these varying background field conditions on the structure of Titan's induced magnetosphere by conducting a systematic survey of Cassini magnetic field observations in the interaction region during flybys TA-T85 (July 2004-July 2012). We introduce a set of criteria that allow to identify deviations in the structure of Titan's induced magnetosphere - as seen by the Cassini magnetometer (MAG) - from the picture of steady-state field line draping. These disruptions are classified as \"weak\", \"moderate\", or \"strong\". After applying this classification scheme to all available Titan encounters, we survey the data for a possible correlation between the disruptions of the draping pattern and the ambient magnetospheric field conditions, as characterized by Simon et al. [2010a]. Our major findings are: (1) When Cassini is embedded in the northern or southern lobe of Saturn's magnetodisk within a \u00b1 3 h interval around closest approach, Titan's induced magnetosphere shows little or no deviations at all from the steady-state draping picture. (2) Even when Titan is embedded in perturbed current sheet fields during an encounter, the notion of draping the average background field around the moon's ionosphere is still applicable to explain MAG observations from numerous Titan flybys. (3) Only when Titan is exposed to intense north-south oscillations of Saturn's current sheet at the time of an encounter, the signatures of the moon's induced magnetosphere may be completely obscured by the ambient field perturbations. (4) So far, T70 is the only flyby that fully meets the idealized pre-Cassini picture of the Titan interaction (steady background field perpendicular to Titan's orbital plane, steady upstream flow, unperturbed induced magnetosphere).",

         "abstract": "By using 7 years optical auroral observations obtained at Yellow River Station (magnetic latitude 76.24\u00b0N) at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, we performed the first extensive survey for the dayside diffuse auroras (DDAs) and acquired observational results as follows. (1) The DDAs can be classified into two broad categories, i.e., unstructured and structured DDAs. The unstructured DDAs are mainly distributed in morning and afternoon, but the structured DDAs predominantly occurred around the magnetic local noon (MLN). (2) The unstructured DDAs observed in morning and afternoon present obviously different properties. The afternoon ones are much stable and seldom show pulsating property. (3) The DDAs are more easily observed under geomagnetically quiet times. (4) The structured DDAs mainly show patchy, stripy, and irregular forms and are often pulsating and drifting. The drifting directions are mostly westward (with speed ~5 km/s), but there are cases showing eastward or poleward drifting. (5) The stripy DDAs are exclusively observed near the MLN and, most importantly, their alignments are confirmed to be consistent with the direction of ionospheric convection near the MLN. (6) A new auroral form, called throat aurora, is found to be developed from the stripy DDAs. Based on the observational results and previous studies, we proposed our explanations to the DDAs. We suggest that the unstructured DDAs observed in the morning are extensions of the nightside diffuse aurora to the dayside, but that observed in the afternoon are predominantly caused by proton precipitations. The structured DDAs occurred near the MLN are caused by interactions of cold plasma structures, which are supposed to be originated from the ionospheric outflows or plasmaspheric drainage plumes, with hot electrons from the plasma sheet. We suppose that the cold plasma structures for producing the patchy DDAs are in lumpy and are more likely from the plasmaspheric drainage plumes. The cold plasma structure for producing the stripy DDAs should be in wedge like and is generated by conveying the cold plasmas from lower L-shell toward higher L-shell with magnetospheric convection, and that for producing the irregular DDAs is resulted from deforming the wedge-like structure by disturbance. The throat aurora is supposed to be projection of a newly opened flux of reconnection. In addition, we also found that structured DDAs correspond to structured electron precipitations in the ionosphere, which implies that the cold plasma structures in the magnetosphere are magnetically mapped to the ionosphere and act as a duct for producing the structured DDAs. We argue that we have presented some new observational results about DDA in this paper, which will be useful for fully understanding the DDAs.",

Four time intervals are selected for comparison, during which MAVEN sampled similar local time (9.3-10.3 h) and latitude (near 20\u00b0S) regions but at different solar longitude positions (two near northern summer solstice, one each at northern vernal and autumnal equinoxes). Persistent and pronounced tidal oscillations characterize the ionosphere and thermosphere, whose longitudinal variations in density are generally in phase with each other. Our analysis of simultaneous and collocated neutral and electron data provides direct observational evidence for thermosphere ionosphere coupling through atmospheric tides. We conclude that the ionosphere is subject to modulation by upward propagating thermal tides, via both tide induced vertical displacement and photochemical reactions. Atmospheric tides constitute a ubiquitous and significant perturbation source to the ionospheric electron density, up to \u223c15% near 200 km.",

The anisotropic pressure of draped magnetosheath magnetic field lines and the inclusion of a reconnection-generated standing slow mode wave fan bounded by a rotational discontinuity within the definition of the magnetotail result in cross sections elongated in the direction parallel to the component of the IMF in the plane perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line. Tilted cross-tail plasma sheets separate the northern and southern lobes within these cross sections. Greater fast-mode speeds perpendicular than parallel to the draped magnetosheath magnetic field lines result in greater distances to the bow shock in the direction perpendicular than parallel to the component of the IMF in the plane transverse to the Sun-Earth line. The magnetotail cross section responds rapidly to variations in the IMF orientation. The rotational discontinuity associated with newly reconnected magnetic field lines requires no more than the magnetosheath convection time to appear at any distance downstream, and further adjustments of the cross section in response to the anisotropic pressures of the draped magnetic field lines require no more than 10-20 min. Consequently, for typical ecliptic IMF orientations and strengths, the magnetotail cross section is oblate, while the bow shock is prolate.",

         "abstract": "evaluate whether ground magnetic responses traditionally viewed as signatures of substorm onset may be related to postonset auroral streamers rather than to substorm onset seen in aurora, we have analyzed ground magnetic and all-sky image responses for 14 substorm onsets selected solely on imager coverage. We find evidence supporting this possibility, the response being approximately coincident for midlatitude positive bay and Pi2 pulsation enhancements and for abrupt auroral zone H decreases at stations near a streamer. These are all signatures of current wedge formation, indicating that substorm current wedge formation may be more of a response to plasma sheet flow channels associated with postonset streamers than to the process leading to auroral onset and that the current wedge may develop via a series of distinctly narrower wedge-like structures. We also find evidence that periods of streamers can occur more than once during a substorm expansion phase and can give magnetic signatures of multiple onsets even if there are no additional auroral onsets. Furthermore, the peak auroral zone H decreases are seen in association with streamers and at times varying from just a few minutes to well over a half hour after substorm auroral onset if there is a prolonged period of streamers. This indicates that peak substorm AE and AL values are likely related to features of postonset streamers and their locations relative to observing stations and are not a measure of the strength of the substorm auroral onset processes. We discuss possible additional implications on substorm expansion phase development.",

The jets were identified as dense and fast streams of the magnetosheath plasma whose energy density is higher than that of the upstream solar wind. The jet interaction with the magnetopause was revealed from sudden inward motion of the magnetopause and an enhancement in the geomagnetic field. The penetration was determined as appearance of the magnetosheath plasma against the background of the hot magnetospheric particle population. We found that almost 60% of the jets penetrated through the magnetopause. Vast majority of the penetrating jets was characterized by high velocities V &gt; 220 km/s and kinetic \u03b2<SUB>k</SUB> &gt; 1 that corresponded to a combination of finite Larmor radius effect with a mechanism of impulsive penetration. The average plasma flux in the penetrating jets was found to be 1.5 times larger than the average plasma flux of the solar wind. The average rate of jet-related penetration of the magnetosheath plasma into the dayside magnetosphere was estimated to be ~10<SUP>29</SUP> particles/d. The rate varies highly with time and can achieve values of 1.5 \u00d7 10<SUP>29</SUP> particles/h that is comparable with estimates of the total amount of plasma entering the dayside magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "We present, for the first time, a quasiperiodic modulation of ionospheric parameters, associated with the occurrence of pulsating auroras, such as electron density, conductance, and electric field. In March 2008, simultaneous campaign-based measurements of pulsating auroras were conducted over Troms\u00f8 (69.60\u00b0N, 19.20\u00b0E), Norway, using an all-sky TV camera (ATV) and the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF system. During an interval within this campaign period, pulsating auroras, with periods of 8-17 s, were observed by the ATV in the morning local time sector (\u223c0500 MLT). In this interval, quasiperiodic oscillations were identified in the raw electron density obtained by EISCAT. The electron density at lower altitudes in the E region (95-115 km) was enhanced by a factor of 3-4 immediately after the optical pulsation became \u201con.\u201d The height-integrated Hall conductance was also elevated, by a factor of 1.5-2, almost in harmony with the electron density variation. The response of the electron density and Hall conductance to the appearance of the pulsating aurora was almost immediate. However, both did not decrease to the background level promptly after optical pulsation ceased. This was primarily because it took a few seconds for the electron density to decrease through recombination with ambient ions at these altitudes. Interestingly, electric field measurements performed by the remote antenna at Kiruna showed that redirection of the electric field occurred when the pulsating aurora was \u201con.\u201d We propose a model in which the enhancement of Hall conductance within patches of the pulsating aurora caused charge accumulation at the edges of the patches, and the electric field was then modified by the resulting polarization electric field. An estimation of the electric field modulation with this model well reproduced the actual electric field observations carried out by EISCAT, which confirmed the validity of the model. These results imply that the ionization caused by high-energy electron precipitation associated with a pulsating aurora has a significant effect on the ionospheric conductivity and current system. This modification of the ionosphere may facilitate characterization of the morphological features of pulsating auroras. In particular, modification of the electric field would affect the spatial structure of pulsating aurora patches, such as their motion and shapes.",

We study the effect of this QTDW-tidal interaction on the ionosphere and thermosphere using the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model. This interaction reduces the amplitude of the migrating diurnal tide in the lower thermosphere by ~10 m/s in neutral winds and also generates sum and difference secondary waves in the lower thermosphere and E region ionosphere. As a result of the changed migrating diurnal tide and sum/difference secondary wave, vertical ion drift varies with local time at different longitudes by ~5 m/s. In addition, the changed migrating diurnal tide also modulates the thermospheric composition (O/N<SUB>2</SUB>). During a QTDW event, the ionosphere F<SUB>2</SUB> region peak electron density (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) is reduced due to the mixing effect of the QTDW dissipation; N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> also shows changes in local time variation due to the QTDW-tidal interaction. The sum and difference secondary waves can cause additional oscillations in vertical ion drift and ionospheric electron densities. The QTDW-tidal interaction is another mechanism by which the QTDW impacts the ionosphere and thermosphere, along with other mechanisms: QTDW modulation of the E region wind dynamo with a period of quasi-2 days and QTDW dissipation induced mixing in the thermosphere.",

Beyond 20 R<SUB>J</SUB>, mixed plasma diffuses further outward by the centrifugal force that can exceed magnetic tension. In the ionosphere, the main oval occurs at 13.7\u00b0-15.5\u00b0 colatitude. The Io disk is inner side of magnetic field lines traced from the low-latitude edge of the main oval. Along magnetic field lines, the main oval is mapped from the outer edge of the Io disk to the entire plasma sheet accompanying rotation delay. Due to the corotation limit, convection is accompanied by plasmoid ejection. Back reaction of plasmoid ejection affects even transport process in the Io disk. The downward FAC occurs in the polar cap showing variability. The region of externally driven Dungey convection seems quite narrow.",

         "abstract": "While nightside subauroral proton aurora shows rapid temporal variations, the cause of this variability has rarely been investigated. Using well-coordinated observations by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) all-sky imagers, THEMIS satellites in the equatorial magnetosphere, and the low-altitude NOAA 17 satellite, we examined the rapid temporal evolution of subauroral proton aurora in the premidnight sector. An isolated proton aurora occurred soon after an auroral poleward boundary intensification that was followed by an auroral streamer reaching the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval. Three THEMIS satellites in the magnetotail detected flow bursts and one of the THEMIS satellites in the outer plasmasphere observed a ring current injection together with electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave intensifications. Proton auroral brightenings occurred multiple times throughout the storm main phase and a majority of those were correlated with auroral streamers reaching the auroral equatorward boundary. This sequence highlights the important role of transient flow bursts and particle injections for plasma transport into the inner magnetosphere and thus reflects a tail-inner magnetospheric interaction process in which transient flow bursts play an important role in injecting ring current ions into the plasmasphere, causing rapid modulation of precipitation and the resultant subauroral proton aurora.",

         "abstract": "Using the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics-general circulation model, we investigate the effect of quasi 2 day wave (QTDW) dissipation on thermospheric composition (O/N<SUB>2</SUB>) and ionospheric electron density during solar minimum. The overall thermospheric and ionospheric changes induced by the QTDW are evaluated by running the model with and without QTDW forcing imposed at the model lower boundary. The dissipation of the westward propagating QTDW in the lower thermosphere causes westward mean wind acceleration and drives a poleward meridional circulation. The circulation induced by the QTDW, as determined by the difference between the mean wind patterns of a run with the QTDW and a base run without the QTDW, enhances the mixing of constituents in the lower thermosphere. Through molecular diffusion, the decrease of the O mixing ratio and the increase of the N<SUB>2</SUB> and O<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratios propagate from the lower thermosphere into the upper thermosphere. As a result, the O/N<SUB>2</SUB> ratio near the ionospheric F<SUB>2</SUB> peak is reduced by about 16-20% at low and midlatitudes. This in turn produces an approximately 16-32% depletion in the F<SUB>2</SUB> peak electron density at low and midlatitudes. The simulated decrease of electron density during a QTDW event is in quantitative agreement with published observations. This work suggests a new major pathway for the traveling planetary wave from the lower atmosphere to affect the thermosphere and ionosphere via dissipation and mean wind acceleration.",

         "abstract": "The configuration and stability of an important kinetic plasma structure, the current sheet, determine the efficiency of magnetic energy storage, release, and transport in surrounding plasmas. These properties depend on \u03b2 (the ratio of plasma pressures to magnetic field pressures) and Mach number M (the ratio of bulk velocities to magnetosonic velocities). For the most investigated current sheet, the near-Earth magnetotail current sheet, these parameters fall within a relatively narrow range of values (high \u03b2, low M). To investigate current sheet behavior for a wider range of parameters, we explore current sheets in the magnetotail of Mars using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission observations. We find that low-\u03b2, high-M current sheets are abundant in Mars's magnetotail, but high-\u03b2, low-M current sheets can also be found there. Low-\u03b2 current sheets are nearly force-free, whereas high-M current sheets are balanced by a plasma flow gradient along the tail. We compare current sheet distributions in a (\u03b2,M) space for the Martian magnetotail, the near-Earth magnetotail (using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission), and the distant magnetotail (using Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) mission). We also find that the pressure balance in the Martian magnetotail current sheet can occur by contributions from a wide range of ion species, or, in low beta cases, from field-aligned currents generation of a force-free magnetic field configuration. The Martian magnetotail is a natural &lt;fi&gt;laboratory&lt;/fi&gt; where current sheet of various types can be found and investigated.",

We focused our model study on the impact of increases in carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>), methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>), and water vapor (H<SUB>2</SUB>O), and decreases in ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) between 1983 and 2003. We used both the National Center for Atmospheric Research Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model and the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model, global mean version, in this study. The model simulations indicate that CO<SUB>2</SUB> is the main forcing mechanism of long-term changes in the thermsophere, with minor influences from O<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>O. At 400 km altitude, global mean thermospheric neutral density decreased by ~4.5% due to CO<SUB>2</SUB> forcing alone, whereas it decreased by ~4.8% due to the combined forcing from all four gases. O<SUB>3</SUB> depletion caused cooling in the stratosphere and mesosphere (maximum decrease of 0.5 K) due to reduced absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation, but had nearly no cooling effect in the thermosphere. However, due to thermal contraction in the stratosphere and mesosphere, O<SUB>3</SUB> depletion caused a small decrease in thermospheric neutral density of ~0.25%. Increases in both CH<SUB>4</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O may slightly warm the upper mesosphere and thermosphere due to increased chemical heating and absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation.",

         "abstract": "During periods of strong geomagnetic activity, intense currents and electric fields originating in the magnetosphere inundate the high-latitude E-region ionosphere. These strong electric fields drive plasma instabilities, including the Farley-Buneman instability (FBI). These instabilities give rise to small-scale plasma turbulence that modifies the large-scale ionospheric conductance that, in turn, affects the evolution of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. Also, during geomagnetic storms, high-energy precipitating electrons, \u22735 keV, frequently penetrate down to the same regions where the intense currents and electric fields exist. This research examines the effects of precipitating electrons on the generation of the FBI and shows that, under many common conditions, it can easily suppress the FBI in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that the plasma pressure of superthermal electrons may significantly exceed the regular plasma pressure of the cold ionospheric plasma. This effect will increase the FBI threshold and suppress the instability in auroral regions. However, our detailed theoretical analysis shows that the effect of the superthermal precipitating electrons on the FBI threshold is much stronger than the pressure effect. The energy dependence of the electron-N<SUB>2</SUB> collision frequency can greatly enhance the effect of this additional pressure, further suppressing the FBI, even at a moderate precipitation level. Therefore, we expect that precipitation will exert an additional significant feedback on the magnetosphere by preventing the elevated conductivity caused by FBI driven turbulence. Both the turbulence-enhanced conductivities and this suppression should be taken into account in global modeling of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

We present a detailed study of a strong localized current, 4900 nA m<SUP>-2</SUP>, located at a fast plasma jet observed in the magnetosheath downstream of a quasi-parallel shock. The thickness of the current region is \u223c3 ion inertial lengths and forms at a boundary separating magnetosheath-like and solar wind-like plasmas. On ion scales the current region has the shape of a sheet with a significant average normal magnetic field component but shows strong variations on smaller scales. The dynamic pressure within the magnetosheath jet is over 3 times the solar wind dynamic pressure. We suggest that the current sheet is forming due to high velocity shears associated with the jet. Inside the current sheet we observe local electron acceleration, producing electron beams, along the magnetic field. However, there is no clear sign of ongoing reconnection. At higher energies, above the beam energy, we observe a loss cone consistent with part of the hot magnetosheath-like electrons escaping into the colder solar wind-like plasma. This suggests that the acceleration process within the current sheet is similar to the one that occurs at shocks, where electron beams and loss cones are also observed. Therefore, electron beams observed in the magnetosheath do not have to originate from the bow shock but can also be generated locally inside the magnetosheath.",

We investigated the properties of these fluctuations during a substorm on 7 February 2009. During this event several spacecraft were observing the magnetotail. By using upstream observations performed by Wind, we conducted a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the substorm. The simulation results were compared to time series of Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) observations in the magnetotail, and it performed well as the spacecraft encountered dipolarizations and strong flows. Further, the power spectral densities and probability distribution functions observed in the magnetotail by THEMIS and in the MHD simulations were similar. Notable features of the event include a large dipolarization growing by accreting smaller earthward moving dipolarization fronts. The dipolarizations were associated with a strong channel of earthward flow and a large vortex. In the MHD simulation results, which are supported by the observations, strong narrow flow channels are a clear and persistent feature of magnetotail convection which exist at the driving scales for the turbulent spectra.",

         "abstract": "The specific entropy (entropy density) S is examined for the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit and for the energetic electron population in the Earth's magnetotail. The outer electron radiation belt is measured with the SOPA detectors on board six geosynchronous satellites and the energetic electrons of the magnetotail are measured with instrumentation on board 12 Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) with a magnetic field model used to map the GPS orbit to the magnetotail. Density n and temperature T values are determined from relativistic Maxwellian fits to the electron measurements, enabling the specific entropy S to be calculated. For low temperatures the nonrelativstic specific entropy is S = T/n<SUP>2/3</SUP>; for a relativistic Maxwellian distribution a relativistically correct expression for S = S(T,n) is derived and used. The outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit local midnight (n \u223c 3 \u00d7 10<SUP>-4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and T \u223c 140 keV) and the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail (n \u223c 1 \u00d7 10<SUP>-4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and T \u223c 50 keV) statistically have the same specific entropy. Hence the two populations are probably the same. This implies adiabatic transport (1) from the magnetotail to the dipole (where the magnetotail electrons are the source of the outer electron radiation belt) or (2) from the dipole to the magnetotail (where the magnetotail electrons are leakage from the radiation belt).",

         "abstract": "The substorm process releases large amounts of energy into the magnetospheric system, although where the energy is transferred to and how it is partitioned remains an open question. In this study, we address whether the substorm process contributes a significant amount of energy to the ring current. The ring current is a highly variable region, and understanding the energization processes provides valuable insight into how substorm-ring current coupling may contribute to the generation of storm conditions and provide a source of energy for wave driving. In order to quantify the energy input into the ring current during the substorm process, we analyze Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment and Helium Oxygen Proton Electron ion flux measurements for H<SUP>+</SUP>, O<SUP>+</SUP>, and He<SUP>+</SUP>. The energy content of the ring current is estimated and binned spatially for L and magnetic local time. The results are combined with an independently derived substorm event list to perform a statistical analysis of variations in the ring current energy content with substorm phase. We show that the ring current energy is significantly higher in the expansion phase compared to the growth phase, with the energy enhancement persisting into the substorm recovery phase. The characteristics of the energy enhancement suggest the injection of energized ions from the tail plasma sheet following substorm onset. The local time variations indicate a loss of energetic H<SUP>+</SUP> ions in the afternoon sector, likely due to wave-particle interactions. Overall, we find that the average energy input into the ring current is \u223c9% of the previously reported energy released during substorms.",

         "abstract": "Studies of Saturn's magnetosphere with the Cassini mission have established the importance of Enceladus as the dominant mass source for Saturn's magnetosphere. It is well known that the ionosphere is an important mass source at Earth during periods of intense geomagnetic activity, but lesser attention has been dedicated to study the ionospheric mass source at Saturn. In this paper we describe a case study of data from Saturn's magnetotail, when Cassini was located at \u2243 2200 h Saturn local time at 36 R<SUB>S</SUB> from Saturn. During several entries into the magnetotail lobe, tailward flowing cold electrons and a cold ion beam were observed directly adjacent to the plasma sheet and extending deeper into the lobe. The electrons and ions appear to be dispersed, dropping to lower energies with time. The composition of both the plasma sheet and lobe ions show very low fluxes (sometimes zero within measurement error) of water group ions. The magnetic field has a swept-forward configuration which is atypical for this region, and the total magnetic field strength is larger than expected at this distance from the planet. Ultraviolet auroral observations show a dawn brightening, and upstream heliospheric models suggest that the magnetosphere is being compressed by a region of high solar wind ram pressure. We interpret this event as the observation of ionospheric outflow in Saturn's magnetotail. We estimate a number flux between (2.95 \u00b1 0.43) \u00d7 10<SUP>9</SUP> and (1.43 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>, 1 or about 2 orders of magnitude larger than suggested by steady state MHD models, with a mass source between 1.4 \u00d710<SUP>2</SUP> and 1.1 \u00d710<SUP>3</SUP> kg/s. After considering several configurations for the active atmospheric regions, we consider as most probable the main auroral oval, with associated mass source between 49.7 \u00b113.4 and 239.8 \u00b164.8 kg/s for an average auroral oval, and 10 \u00b14 and 49 \u00b123 kg/s for the specific auroral oval morphology found during this event. It is not clear how much of this mass is trapped within the magnetosphere and how much is lost to the solar wind.",

         "abstract": "solar wind impacting the Earth varies over a wide range of time scales, driving a corresponding range of geomagnetic activity. Past work has strongly indicated that the rate of merging on the frontside magnetosphere is the most important predictor for magnetospheric activity, especially over a few hours. However, the magnetosphere exhibits variations on other time scales, including UT, seasonal, and solar cycle variations. Much of this geomagnetic variation cannot be reasonably attributed to changes in the solar wind driving\u2014that is, it is not created by the original Russell-McPherron effect or any generalization thereof. In this paper we examine the solar cycle, seasonal, and diurnal effects based upon the frequency of substorm onsets, using a data set of 53,000 substorm onsets. These were identified through the SuperMAG collaboration and span three decades with continuous coverage. Solar cycle variations include a profound minimum in 2009 (448 substorms) and peak in 2003 (3727). The magnitude of this variation (a factor of 8.3) is not explained through variations in estimators of the frontside merging rate (such as d\u03a6<SUB>MP</SUB>/dt), even when the more detailed probability distribution functions are examined. Instead, v, or better, n<SUP>1/2</SUP>v<SUP>2</SUP> seems to be implicated in the dramatic difference between active and quiet years, even beyond the role of velocity in modulating merging. Moreover, we find that although most substorms are preceded by flux loading (78.5% are above the mean and 83.8% above median solar wind driving), a high solar wind v is almost as important (68.3% above mean, 74.8% above median). This and other evidence suggest that either v or n<SUP>1/2</SUP>v<SUP>2</SUP> (but probably not p) plays a strong secondary role in substorm onset. As for the seasonal and diurnal effects, the elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit, which is closest to the Sun in January, leads to a larger solar wind driving (measured by Bs, vBs, or d\u03a6<SUB>MP</SUB>/dt) in November, as is confirmed by 22 years of solar wind observations. However, substorms peak in October and March and have a UT dependence best explained by whether a conducting path established by solar illumination exists in at least one hemisphere in the region where substorm onsets typically occur.",

         "abstract": "It took about 12 h for the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite to fly from the outbound pass to inbound pass of every inner magnetosphere crossing. This provides a unique opportunity to study the nightside-to-dayside evolution of the corotating inner magnetosphere when the outbound pass is in the nighttime while the inbound pass is in the daytime because a flux tube observed on the nightside may be observed again on the dayside in such situation. The differences between the two observations may be caused by the evolution of the flux tube. By analyzing both the passive and active sounding measurements from the IMAGE Radio Plasma Imager, we study two cases concerning this evolution. One, under a quiet geomagnetic condition, shows a typical evolution process during which the plasmapause was observed on both the nightside and the dayside. The other, during the recovery phase of a magnetic storm, shows a different inner magnetospheric structure in which the distinct plasmapause observed on the nightside becomes unidentifiable on the dayside as the density in the nearly empty nightside plasmatrough increases to a level similar to that of the plasmasphere. It is shown that the evolutions of the inner magnetosphere in both cases were primarily controlled by the fast plasma refilling of the flux tubes from the ionosphere as the flux tubes drift from the nightside to the dayside. In the former case the fast refilling was confined inside L = \u223c6.3, while in the latter case the fast refilling extended to at least L = 10. The present observations provide an example for fast refilling as a possible cause of the smooth density transition from the plasmasphere to the subauroral region and demonstrate the importance of the plasmasphere-ionosphere coupling in controlling the structures of the inner magnetosphere.",

This study investigates the quasi-3-day UFK wave and its effects on the variations of the ionosphere at low latitudes and midlatitudes using coordinated observations of both the atmosphere and ionosphere during the January 2010 URSI World Day campaign. The global maps of TEC from the IGS ground-based GPS product demonstrate a 3-day periodic variation during January 15-25. This variation has the largest amplitude at 15\u00b0 magnetic latitude and extends into lower latitudes. Simultaneously, a 3-day wave is observed in the mesosphere in the zonal wind measurements by a meteor radar at the magnetic equator. The latitudinal range of the TEC variation (20\u00b0S-20\u00b0N) is also consistent with that of the 3-day wave. The Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) observations show a 3-day signature in vertical ion drifts over Jicamarca (11.9\u00b0S, 76\u00b0W) and in the electron densities in the top side of ionosphere measured from Millstone Hill (42.6\u00b0N, 71.5\u00b0W). This signature is consistent with the fountain effect in the equatorial region, and shows the impact on the topside ionosphere at midlatitudes. The UFK wave is trapped within \u00b130\u00b0 geographic latitude, but this study shows that the effects of the wave could reach the ionosphere at the higher latitude even as high as 40\u00b0N (50\u00b0N magnetic latitude).",

         "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a process during which magnetic energy is released as kinetic energy. It is considered a crucial driver of energy transport and mass loss within Saturn's magnetosphere. On long-term timescales, is thought to be predominantly driven by the rapid rotation of equatorially mass-loaded flux tubes (i.e., the Vasyliunas cycle), but there is some non-negligible driving from the solar wind as well (i.e., the Dungey cycle). In this study, we investigate an atmospheric driven phenomenon that modulates Saturn's magnetosphere every \u223c10.6-10.8 hr, known as planetary period oscillations (PPOs), as an additional driver of magnetic reconnection at Saturn. Using an empirical model of PPO dynamics and Cassini magnetic field and plasma measurements, we find that PPO-driven magnetic reconnection is likely to occur in Saturn's magnetosphere, however, the occurrence of the phenomenon depends on temporally variable characteristics of the PPO systems and spatial asymmetries within Saturn's equatorial magnetosphere. Thus, it is not expected to be an on-going process. On year-long timescales, we find that PPOs are expected to be on par with the Dungey Cycle in driving circulation within Saturn's magnetosphere. However, on \u223c1-2 weeks-long timescales, under specific conditions where PPO-driven reconnection is expected to be active, this phenomenon can become more significant than the Vasyliunas cycle, and thus dominate circulation within Saturn's magnetosphere. On year-long timescales, this process is estimated to remove upwards of \u223c20% of the mass loaded into the magnetosphere by Enceladus.",

         "abstract": "The different responses of the magnetosphere to sudden solar wind density enhancements are investigated. The majority of the responses are observed to have two phases: the first is due to an inductive E field propagating through the system, while the second is due to a vortex formation in the magnetosphere. However, during some events, the system displays a single-phase response. In order to understand the controlling parameters in the system response, statistical analyses of several solar wind external characteristics as well as the internal index D<SUB>st</SUB> are conducted. Results of these analyses show that none of those characteristics seem to be associated with the way the geospace system responds to the abrupt solar wind density increase. Owing to the lack of statistics in the analysis, simulations investigating the effect of the solar wind Alfv\u00e9n Mach number on the magnetospheric response have been conducted. The simulation results indicate that the two-phase response is always present but that a low solar wind Mach number causes an indistinct two-phase response, which is difficult to identify as having two phases. Compression signals following the sudden compression at the magnetopause are carried by a fast mode wave in the magnetosphere, which propagates toward the Earth and is reflected back toward the magnetopause by the plasmapause or ionosphere. The wave is subsequently reflected back again, leading to a secondary Earthward propagation. These multiple bounces of the fast mode wave result in two groups of the two-phase responses in the ionosphere, although the second group is extremely difficult to identify in ionospheric data.",

The data and model reveal some new aspects primarily for the low solar EUV fluxes. The ionosphere develops as a thin layer in the morning though becomes nearly as strong as that at normal solar minimum at around diurnal maximum (14 LT). However, after sunset the ionosphere-plasmasphere system decays rapidly to become an extremely weak cold system prior to sunrise (05 LT) when the ionosphere contracts to about 1/3rd as strong as that at normal solar minimum, with peak density only about 1.8 \u00d7 10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, half width only about 150 km, and O<SUP>+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> transition height as low as 475 km where the ion densities are only 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and ion temperatures are only 600 K.

         "abstract": "Field-aligned currents (FACs), also known as Birkeland currents, are the agents by which energy and momentum are transferred to the ionosphere from the magnetosphere and solar wind. This coupling is enhanced at substorm onset through the formation of the substorm current wedge. Using FAC data from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment and substorm expansion phase onsets identified using the Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet technique, we examine the Northern Hemisphere FACs in all local time sectors with respect to substorm onset and subdivided by season. Our results show that while there is a strong seasonal dependence on the underlying FACs, the increase in FACs following substorm onset only varies by 10% with season, with substorms increasing the hemispheric FACs by 420 kA on average. Over an hour prior to substorm onset, the dayside currents in the postnoon quadrant increase linearly, whereas the nightside currents show a linear increase starting 20-30 min before onset. After onset, the nightside Region 1, Region 2, and nonlocally closed currents and the SuperMAG AL (SML) index follow the Weimer (1994, https://doi.org/10.1029/93JA02721) model with the same time constants in each season. These results contrast earlier contradictory studies that indicate that substorms are either longer in the summer or decay faster in the summer. Our results imply that, on average, substorm FACs do not change with season but that their relative impact on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system does due to the changes in the underlying currents.",

         "abstract": "Changes in equatorial D-region electron density are studied using subionospherically propagating VLF signal at 18.2 kHz over a distance of 2200 km during the total solar eclipse of 22 July 2009. There are very few studies about the eclipse's effects on the equatorial lower ionosphere in the scientific literature. In the light of that, the objective of the present work is to study the effects of the eclipse on the dynamics of the equatorial lower ionosphere during ionospheric sunrise transition period. In the present case, great circle path between VLF transmitter and receiver falls totally in partial eclipse zone, having a maximum solar obscuration of 90% and an average obscuration of 74%. Results show an average decrease of 3.2 dB in signal strength compared to control days during peak solar obscuration over the path. A comparison with previous studies shows an increase both in lower ionosphere virtual reflection height (H') and Wait inverse scale height parameter (\u03b2); the values estimated are 74.5 km and 0.46 km<SUP>-1</SUP> compared to unperturbed ionosphere values of 71 km and 0.43 km<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. During maximum eclipse over the path, the model profile shows an average 80% drop in electron density at a height of 71 km at equatorial lower ionosphere. A nonlinear variation of lower ionosphere electron density with solar radiation is found as opposed to the model study proposed by previous workers.",

These pulsations can also be observed at geosynchronous orbit, suggesting that they propagate from (or beyond) geosynchronous orbit to the ionosphere at substorm onset. Independently, investigations have shown that the initial brightening of an arc at subtorm onset is Alfv\u00e9nic in nature (i.e., that the aurora during the initial brightening is wave-driven). These results raise the question of whether Pi1B pulsations might drive Alfv\u00e9nic aurora at substorm onset. In this paper, data from a single event are presented that show Pi1B pulsations observed simultaneously at geosynchronous orbit, by FAST just above the ionosphere and by various ground stations. The event is observed by FAST within a few minutes of the onset of Pi1B pulsations, with an electron signature of the onset arc that is quite characteristic of Alfv\u00e9nic aurora, showing that at least a portion of the initial brightening is wave-driven and associating this with the presence of Pi1B pulsations. The implication of this work is that Pi1B pulsations propagate to the ionosphere from beyond geosynchronous orbit and provide the wave power to drive Alfv\u00e9nic aurora at substorm onset, at least for this single, isolated event. The luminosity associated with the Alfv\u00e9nic aurora, however, may only provide a small contribution to the total brightness.",

The focus is on the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere simulated by the Ground-to-topside model of the Atmosphere and Ionosphere for Aeronomy (GAIA), Whole Atmosphere Model plus Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere (WAM+GIP), and Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended version plus Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (WACCMX+TIMEGCM). The simulations are compared with observations of the equatorial vertical plasma drift in the American and Indian longitude sectors, zonal mean F region peak density (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites, and ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) total electron content (TEC) at 75\u00b0W. The model simulations all reproduce the observed morning enhancement and afternoon decrease in the vertical plasma drift, as well as the progression of the anomalies toward later local times over the course of several days. However, notable discrepancies among the simulations are seen in terms of the magnitude of the drift perturbations, and rate of the local time shift. Comparison of the electron densities further reveals that although many of the broad features of the ionosphere variability are captured by the simulations, there are significant differences among the different model simulations, as well as between the simulations and observations. Additional simulations are performed where the neutral atmospheres from four different whole atmosphere models (GAIA, HAMMONIA (Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere), WAM, and WACCMX) provide the lower atmospheric forcing in the TIME-GCM. These simulations demonstrate that different neutral atmospheres, in particular, differences in the solar migrating semidiurnal tide, are partly responsible for the differences in the simulated ionosphere variability in GAIA, WAM+GIP, and WACCMX+TIMEGCM.",

The results show that the FAC distribution in the plasma sheet boundary layers in the magnetotail has dusk-dawn asymmetry, earthward-tailward (polarity) asymmetry, and north-south asymmetry. The occurrence and polarities of FACs in the Northern Hemisphere are different from those in the Southern Hemisphere. The average density and the standard deviation of the FACs that are most likely to be connected to the Earth are 4.90 nA m<SUP>-2</SUP> and 2.55 nA m<SUP>-2</SUP> in the Northern Hemisphere and 4.21 nA m<SUP>-2</SUP> and 1.80 nA m<SUP>-2</SUP> in the Southern Hemisphere, respectively. For investigating the mechanism of the north-south asymmetry, we mapped the FACs along the field line into the polar region. The footprints of the FACs also show a difference between the Southern and Northern hemispheres (as a function of mapped latitude). These characteristics suggest a north-south asymmetry of the FACs in the magnetosphere. Further investigation is needed to identify the causes of this asymmetry, although the configuration of the magnetosphere, the polar cap boundary, the conductivity in the ionosphere, or the various solar wind-magnetosphere interaction processes all may be contributors. That the FAC densities are different between the hemispheres suggests that an important source of these currents must be a voltage generator.",

         "abstract": "Substorms cause significant disturbances in the ionosphere. However, it has not been well understood how the electric field and electrojet in the dayside equatorial ionosphere respond to substorm onset. Previous studies found that the equatorial electric field, after substorm onset, could be eastward or westward. Because the onset of isolated substorms is often related to a northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), the measured total electric field is determined by contributions from both IMF northward turning and substorm onset and is not necessarily the signature of the onset. In order to exclude the effect of IMF northward turning, we analyze the variations of ionospheric electric field and electrojet during storm time substorms when the IMF remains stable. Thus, the ionospheric variations can be identified to be caused solely by substorms. The electric field data are measured by the Jicamarca radar, and the electrojet is derived from magnetometers at Jicamarca and Piura. It is found that substorm onset induces an eastward electric field and electrojet in the dayside equatorial ionosphere when the IMF remains continuously southward across the onset. The equatorial electrojet starts to increase at the onset, reaches a maximum value \u223c30 min after the onset, and then decreases to the pre-onset value \u223c60 min after the onset. Westward electric field and counter-electrojet occur only if the substorm onset is associated with a northward turning of the IMF. It is concluded that the effect of substorm onset on the dayside equatorial ionosphere, without involvement of IMF reorientations, is an enhanced eastward electric field.",

The properties of these \u201cgiants,\u201d such as their polarity, conductivity, and currents, have been predicted by models, but are poorly characterized by measurements. A recent observation of a giant, fortuitously illuminated by an unusual sprite discharge in the mesosphere, allows us to study their electric properties and effects on the atmosphere-ionosphere. We show from a first-principles model of the combined giant and sprite event that the observations are consistent with the nature of the giant being a leader in the stratosphere of line charge density \u223c0.8 mCm<SUP>-1</SUP> and of multiple streamers in the mesosphere. It is further shown that the giant modifies the free electron content of the lower ionosphere because of electric field-driven ionization, electron attachment and detachment processes. This is the first time that sprites are used for sounding the properties of the mesosphere. The results presented here will allow evaluation of theories for jet and gigantic jets and of their influence on the atmosphere and ionosphere.",

The cold Jovian plasma is simulated with a 3-D plasma-planetary interaction hybrid model, which produces 2-D surface precipitation maps for magnetospheric H<SUP>+</SUP>, O<SUP>+</SUP>, O<SUP>++</SUP>, and S<SUP>++</SUP>. For the hot Jovian plasma, we assume isotropic precipitation onto the complete spherical surface. Two scenarios are investigated: one where no ionospheric shielding takes place and accordingly full plasma penetration is implemented (no-ionosphere scenario) and one where an ionosphere lets virtually none of the cold plasma but all of the hot plasma reach Callisto's surface (ionosphere scenario). In the 3-D exosphere model, neutral particles are sputtered from the surface and followed on their individual trajectories. The 3-D density profiles show that whereas in the no-ionosphere scenario the ram direction is favored, the ionosphere scenario produces almost uniform density profiles. In addition, the density profiles in the ionosphere scenario are reduced by a factor of \u223c2.5 with respect to the no-ionosphere scenario. We find that the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer, which is part of the Particle Environment Package on board the JUpiter ICy moons Explorer mission, will be able to detect the different sputter populations from Callisto's icy surface and the major sputter populations from Callisto's nonicy surface. The chemical composition of Callisto's exosphere can be directly linked to the chemical composition of its surface and will offer us information not only on Callisto's formation scenario but also on the building blocks of the Jupiter system.",

FALEOs appear after a magnetic dipolarization signature with approximately 6-20 min delay. It has the energy-dispersion signature from a few keV to \u223c100 eV only in the direction parallel to the magnetic field at Arase, while it decreases its energy from a few keV down to 10 eV in both the parallel and antiparallel directions at Probes A and B. We perform a numerical simulation to trace trajectories of test O<SUP>+</SUP> ions in a model magnetosphere, which are launched from above the ionosphere 3-15 min after a substorm. Flying virtual satellites that have the same orbits as the real satellites, we create virtual energy-time spectrograms of O<SUP>+</SUP> ions to compare with the observed ones. Results show a very good correspondence between them, indicating that FALEOs originate from ionospheric O<SUP>+</SUP> ions that are extracted from the upper ionosphere at substorm onset and flow along the magnetic field toward the geomagnetic equator. It is also revealed that 3-9 hr after their launch, test O<SUP>+</SUP> ions less than 400 eV have a spatial distribution in the inner magnetosphere which is similar to those of the warm plasma cloak and the oxygen torus. We therefore conclude that FALEO is a source of those cold ion populations.",

The most important features that characterize this state include (1) magnetic reconnections can still occur, which take place at the equatorward of the cusp in one hemisphere, the tailward of the cusp in the other hemisphere, and also in the plasma sheet; (2) significant north-south asymmetry exists in both magnetosphere and ionosphere; (3) the polar ionosphere mainly presents a weak two-cell convection pattern, with the polar cap potential valued at \u223c30 kV; (4) the whole magnetosphere-ionosphere system stays in a very quiet state, and the AL index does not exceed -70 nT; and (5) the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can still be excited at both flanks of the magnetosphere. These results imply the controlling role of the IMF direction between the solar wind and magnetosphere interactions and improve our understanding of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

Toward this end, we conducted a year-long thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) simulation for 2009, which is characterized by low solar and geomagnetic activity. In order to account for tropospheric waves and tides propagating upward into the \u223c30-400 km model domain, we used 3-hourly MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application) reanalysis data. We focus on exospheric tidal temperatures, which are also compared with 72 day mean determinations from combined Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations to assess the model's capability to capture the observed tidal signatures and to quantify the uncertainties associated with the satellite exospheric temperature determination technique. We found strong day-to-day tidal variability in TIME-GCM that is smoothed out when averaged over as few as ten days. TIME-GCM notably overestimates the 72 day mean eastward propagating tides observed by CHAMP/GRACE, while capturing many of the salient features of other tidal components. However, the CHAMP/GRACE tidal determination technique only provides a gross climatological representation, underestimates the majority of the tidal components in the climatological spectrum, and moreover fails to characterize the extreme variability that drives the dynamics and electrodynamics of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. A multisatellite mission that samples at least six local times simultaneously is needed to provide this quantification.",

Other, more effective heat sources are therefore necessary to explain the high observed temperatures \u2265900 K. It has been suggested that heating resulting from the atmospheric interaction with Jupiter's dynamic magnetosphere could account for the excess heat required. However to date, no numerical models have been successful at reproducing Jupiter's hot thermosphere without invoking essentially ad hoc heating mechanisms. Work presented in Yates et al. (2014, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2013.11.009\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2013.11.009</A>) emphasized the importance of incorporating time dependence in magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling when simulating this aspect of the Jovian system. We extend their model (for a single magnetospheric compression or expansion) to simulate the response of thermospheric heating to multiple shocks and rarefactions in the solar wind for the first time. We employ a configurable magnetosphere model coupled to an azimuthally symmetric general circulation model. We compare the response of thermospheric temperatures to these consecutive magnetospheric reconfigurations over a period of 100 Jovian rotations. We find that the thermal structure of our model thermosphere does not respond significantly to such a prolonged period of magnetospheric reconfigurations. Thermospheric mean temperatures increase by a maximum of \u223c15 K throughout our simulation. The high-latitude and high-altitude thermosphere is most influenced by magnetospheric reconfigurations. While this simulation shows that magnetospheric reconfigurations can heat the thermosphere, it also shows the need to consider a more realistic representation of the coupled Jovian system as well as alternate sources of heating not dependent on the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "New mechanisms for imposing planetary wave (PW) variability on the ionosphere-thermosphere system are discovered in numerical experiments conducted with the National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model. First, it is demonstrated that a tidal spectrum modulated at PW periods (3-20 days) entering the ionosphere-thermosphere system near 100 km is responsible for producing \u00b140 m/s and \u00b110-15 K PW period oscillations between 110 and 150 km at low to middle latitudes. The dominant response is broadband and zonally symmetric (i.e., \"S0\") over a range of periods and is attributable to tidal dissipation; essentially, the ionosphere-thermosphere system \"vacillates\" in response to dissipation of the PW-modulated tidal spectrum. In addition, some specific westward propagating PWs such as the quasi-6-day wave are amplified by the presence of the tidal spectrum; the underlying mechanism is hypothesized to be a second-stage nonlinear interaction. The S0 total neutral mass density (\u03c1) response at 325 km consists of PW period fluctuations of order \u00b13-4%, roughly equivalent to the day-to-day variability associated with low-level geomagnetic activity. The variability in \u03c1 over short periods (\u223c&lt; 9 days) correlates with temperature changes, indicating a response of hydrostatic origin. Over longer periods \u03c1 is also controlled by composition and mean molecular mass. While the upper-thermosphere impacts are modest, they do translate to more significant changes in the F region ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Since 1892, when an aurora was first imaged by Martin Brendel, a German physicist, auroral forms and their dynamics have been acquired only when the aurora is in darkness. Due to the sunlight contamination from Rayleigh scattering, it has been a long-term challenge of imaging sunlit aurora. In addition, other constraints exist, such as moonlight contamination, cloud occultation, and the limited land area available for installing imagers near the auroral zone in both hemispheres. While auroral imaging from space provides auroral global dynamics or small-scale structures, depending on the spacecraft orbit, the image quality is affected by low spatial and temporal resolutions, sunlight, and the lack of traceability of auroral variations. Consequently, we have little knowledge of sunlit auroral forms and their dynamics, as well as their coupling to conjugate aurora. Given the fact that the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is initiated on the dayside, understanding sunlit and dayside aurorae becomes very interesting and important. A scenario of imaging sunlit aurora from a balloon and the conceptual design of the instrument have been depicted in our previous article (Zhou et al., 2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL028611\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL028611</A>). This paper elaborates the new science enabled by this new means and the feasibility of auroral ballooning by showing some sunlit auroral images obtained from a balloon flight and calculations of the corresponding sky brightness. In addition, we describe and explain the most important specs of the new NIR camera-head being developed for the BALBOA balloon mission that is currently supported by the NASA/Low Cost Access to Space program.",

In this study, for the first time, we quantitatively investigate the posteclipse response of the global ionosphere and thermosphere system to the recent Great American Solar Eclipse using a high-resolution, global, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics model. It was found that the posteclipse response of the ionosphere and thermosphere is significant and worldwide, which was not expected. Specifically, even 9 hr after the eclipse ended, the globally averaged ionospheric total electron content perturbations were about 0.2 total electron content unit, and the corresponding changes in neutral temperature and winds reached 2 K and 2 m/s. The changes in the global dynamic and energetic processes associated with the solar eclipse contributed to this long-lasting response of the ionosphere and thermosphere during the posteclipse period.",

         "abstract": "A recent statistical study of ULF waves driven by substorm-injected particles observed using Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) found that the phase characteristics of these waves varied depending on where the wave was observed relative to the substorm. Typically, positive azimuthal wave numbers, m, were observed in waves generated to the east of the substorms and negative m to the west. The magnitude of m typically increased with the azimuthal separation between the wave observation and the substorm location. The energies estimated for the driving particles for these 83 wave events were found to be highest when the waves were observed closer to the substorm and lowest farther away. Each of the 83 events studied by James et al. (2013) involved just a single wave observation per substorm. Here a study of three individual substorm events are presented, with associated observations of multiple ULF waves using various different SuperDARN radars. We demonstrate that a single substorm is capable of driving a number of wave events characterized by different azimuthal scale lengths and wave periods, associated with different energies, W, in the driving particle population. We find that similar trends in m and W exist for multiple wave events with a single substorm as was seen in the single wave events of James et al. (2013). The variety of wave periods present on similar L shells in this study may also be evidence for the detection of both poloidal Alfv\u00e9n and drift compressional mode waves driven by substorm-injected particles.",

         "abstract": "At substorm expansion onset, upward field-aligned currents (FACs) increase abruptly, and a large amount of electromagnetic energy starts to consume in the polar ionosphere. A question arises as to where the energy comes from. Based on the results obtained by the global magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we present energy flow and energy conversion associated with the upward FACs that manifest the onset. Our simulations show that the cusp/mantle region transmits electromagnetic energy to almost the entire region of the magnetosphere when the interplanetary magnetic field is southward. Integral curve of the Poynting flux shows a spiral moving toward the ionosphere, probably suggesting the pathway of electromagnetic energy from the cusp/mantle dynamo to the ionosphere. The near-Earth reconnection initiates three-dimensional redistribution of the magnetosphere. Flow shear in the near-Earth region results in the generation of the near-Earth dynamo and the onset FACs. The onset FACs are responsible to transport the electromagnetic energy toward the Earth. In the near-Earth region, the electromagnetic energy coming from the cusp/mantle dynamo is converted to the kinetic energy (known as bursty bulk flow) and the thermal energy (associated with high-pressure region in the inner magnetosphere). Then, they are converted to the electromagnetic energy associated with the onset FACs. A part of electromagnetic energy is stored in the lobe region during the growth phase. The release of the stored energy, together with the continuously supplied energy from the cusp/mantle dynamo, contributes to the energy supply to the ionosphere during the expansion phase.",

In order to remove the longitudinal structure induced by tides, diurnally averaged SABER temperatures are used. For MIPAS data, we use averaged temperatures between day and night. The satellite observations show that there are strong longitudinal variations in temperature in the high-latitude lower thermosphere that persist over all seasons. The peak of the diurnally averaged temperature in the lower thermosphere always occurs around the auroral zone. A clear asymmetry between the two hemispheres in the longitudinal temperature structure is observed, being more pronounced in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. In both hemispheres, the longitudinal variation is dominated by the first harmonic in longitude. The total radiative cooling observed by SABER has a structure in longitude that is similar to that of temperature. Modeling simulations using the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model reproduce similar features of the longitudinal variations of temperature in the lower thermosphere. Comparison of two model runs with and without auroral heating confirms that auroral heating causes the observed longitudinal variations. The multiyear averaged vertical structures of temperature observed by the two satellite instruments indicate that the impact of auroral heating on the thermodynamics of the neutral atmosphere can penetrate down to about 105 km.",

         "abstract": "Very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals from navigational transmitters propagate worldwide in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide formed by the Earth and the electrically conducting lower ionosphere. Changes in the signal properties are signatures of variations in the conductivity of the reflecting boundary of the lower ionosphere which is located in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and their analysis is, therefore, a way to study processes in these remote regions. Here we present a study on amplitude perturbations of local origin on the VLF transmitter signals (NPM, NLK, NAA, and JJI) observed during tropical cyclone (TC) Evan, 9-16 December 2012 when TC was in the proximity of the transmitter-receiver links. We observed a maximum amplitude perturbation of 5.7 dB on JJI transmitter during 16 December event. From Long Wave Propagation Capability model applied to three selected events we estimate a maximum decrease in the nighttime D region reference height (H') by 5.2 km (13 December, NPM) and maximum increase in the daytime D region H' by 6.1 km and 7.5 km (14 and 16 December, JJI). The results suggest that the TC caused the neutral densities of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere to lift and sink (bringing the lower ionosphere with it), an effect that may be mediated by gravity waves generated by the TC. The perturbations were observed before the storm was classified as a TC, at a time when it was a tropical depression, suggesting the broader conclusion that severe convective storms, in general, perturb the mesosphere and the stratosphere through which the perturbations propagate.",

Because of the magnetotail current sheet's dynamical nature, however, simultaneous plasma and magnetic field measurements at different radial distances are required to reveal this configuration. Simultaneous observations of the magnetotail current sheet from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) D (around 10R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail), Geotail (around 30R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail), and Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moons Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) P1 (around 55R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail) are used to study distributions of plasma (ion) density and temperature along (Earth-Sun direction) and across (north-south direction) the magnetotail. Fourteen events (each including several current sheet crossings at different downtail distances) are studied. We demonstrate that the plasma temperature along and across the magnetotail varies more significantly than plasma density does. The temperature decrease from equatorial plane to current sheet boundaries is a major contributor to the cross-tail pressure balance. The Alfven velocity V<SUB>A,B</SUB> calculated at the current sheet boundaries increases significantly toward the Earth from 700 km/s at lunar orbit \u223c55R<SUB>E</SUB> to 2200 km/s around \u223c10R<SUB>E</SUB> downtail. The corresponding energy EA=mpVA,B2 (m<SUB>p</SUB> is the proton mass) is 4 times larger than the plasma temperature T<SUB>0</SUB> in the magnetotail's equatorial plane, whereas the ratio E<SUB>A</SUB>/T<SUB>0</SUB> is constant along the magnetotail. The plasma temperature T<SUB>0</SUB> measured around lunar orbit in the magnetotail agrees well with the simultaneously measured energy of solar wind protons mpVSW2/2 (V<SUB>SW</SUB> is the solar wind speed).",

         "abstract": "Using a global magnetospheric MHD model coupled with a kinetic ring current model, we investigate the effects of magnetotail dynamics, particularly the earthward bursty bulk flows (BBFs) produced by the tail reconnection, on the global-scale current systems. The simulation results indicate that after BBFs brake around X = -10 R<SUB>E</SUB> due to the dipolar \"magnetic wall,\" vortices are generated on the edge of the braking region and inside the inner magnetosphere. Each pair of vortex in the inner magnetosphere disturbs the westward ring current to arc radially inward as well as toward high latitudes. The resultant pressure gradient on the azimuthal direction induces region-1 sense field-aligned component from the ring current, which eventually is diverted into the ionosphere at high latitudes, giving rise to a pair of field-aligned current (FAC) eddies in the ionosphere. On the edge of the flow braking region where vortices also emerge, a pair of region-1 sense FACs arises, diverted from the cross-tail duskward current, generating a substorm current wedge. This is again attributed to the increase of thermal pressure ahead of the bursty flows turning azimuthally. It is further found that when multiple BBFs, despite their localization, continually and rapidly impinge on the \"wall,\" carrying sufficient tail plasma sheet population toward the Earth, they can lead to the formation of a new ring current. These results indicate the important role that BBFs play in bridging the tail and the inner magnetosphere ring current and bring new insight into the storm-substorm relation.",

The study confirms (a) The magnetic energy for the expansion phase is accumulated with the rate of a little more than 10<SUP>18</SUP> erg/s during the growth phase which lasts for about 1 h (because the ionosphere cannot dissipate the input power). (b) The global energy dissipation rate in the ionosphere (including the Joule heat production and the particle precipitation) is more than 3.3 \u00d7 10<SUP>18</SUP> erg/s. (c) Thus, the total energy consumption by the ionosphere during the impulsive expansion phase (lasting for about 1 h) is 1.2 \u00d7 10<SUP>22</SUP> erg or up to 10<SUP>23</SUP> erg for medium substorms. (d) However, it is shown that even the total magnetic energy in the magnetotail at a distance between 10 R<SUB>E</SUB> and 20 R<SUB>E</SUB> (6.5 \u00d7 10<SUP>21</SUP> ergs = 6.5 \u00d7 10<SUP>14</SUP> J) cannot supply the energy for the expansion phase. This estimate is consistent with the most recent satellite observations (4.3 \u00d7 10<SUP>13</SUP> J (= 4.3 \u00d7 10<SUP>20</SUP> ergs)). Thus, the following conclusions may be applicable for medium intensity substorms: (i) The major part of the magnetic energy for the expansion phase must be accumulated within a distance of 10 R<SUB>E</SUB> and be released almost totally during the expansion phase (because the duration of the growth phase and the expansion phase is about the same). (ii) This suggests that there is an upper limit of the energy which the magnetosphere can accumulate even at distances less than 10 R<SUB>E</SUB>. Further, it is confirmed that: (a) The expansion phase is characterized by a single cell current system UL (not a twin cell current system DD which is driven by the earthward plasma convection from the magnetotail). (b) The UL current is independent of the DD current, requiring a different origin. (c) During the recovery phase, the UL current is absent and the DD current approximately follows \u025b (no accumulation of the energy), because the ionosphere is capable of dissipating the power even if the power is moderate). (d) Based on these results, as an example, one possible chain of processes within 10 R<SUB>E</SUB> is proposed as the release process of the accumulated magnetic energy by taking into account the fact that the frozen-in field condition is observed to be broken down.",

Comparison with TIME-GCM results from a heretofore standard simulation that includes climatological tropospheric tides from the global-scale wave model reveal evidence of the impacts of MERRA forcing throughout the model domain, including measurable tidal variability in the TIME-GCM upper thermosphere. Additional comparisons with measurements made by the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite show improved TIME-GCM capability to capture day-to-day variations in thermospheric density for the November-December 2009 period with the new MERRA lower boundary forcing.",

         "abstract": "The sudden formation of parallel electric fields in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling system is essential to complete substorm onset. From this standpoint, we focus substorm ignition on field-aligned acceleration by studying the dynamical behavior of auroral kilometric radiation. Field-aligned auroral acceleration shows a distinct two-step evolution at substorm onset: the activation of low-altitude acceleration (h \u223c 4000-5000 km) which corresponds to auroral initial brightening and the subsequent abrupt breakout of high-altitude acceleration (h \u223c 6000-12,000 km) which corresponds to auroral breakup. Cases when only low-altitude acceleration (first-step evolution) is activated are pseudosubstorms. This indicates that the second evolution of field-aligned acceleration divides full substorm from pseudosubstorm. The statistical relationship between the plasma flow burst in the plasma sheet and its response to the M-I coupling region shows that about 65% of flow bursts cause pseudobreakup/initial brightening (low-altitude acceleration) and one third of them develops into full substorm (low-altitude and high-altitude accelerations), while the magnitude of flow velocity does not necessarily distinguish between pseudobreakup and full substorm. This suggests that some plasma flow bursts originate field-aligned current which first enhance low-altitude acceleration, and the increasing field-aligned current induces second acceleration above the preexisting low-altitude acceleration as a consequence of current/current-driven instabilities. In this sense, the substorm is finally ignited in the auroral M-I coupling region.",

         "abstract": "We have developed a global simulation code which gives numerical solutions having an extremely high resolution. The substorm solution obtained from this simulation code reproduces the precise features of the substorm onset in the ionosphere. It can reproduce the onset that starts from the equatorward side of the quiet arc, two step development of the onset, and the westward traveling surge (WTS) that starts 2 min after the initial brightening. Then, we investigated the counter structures in the magnetosphere that correspond to each event in the ionosphere. The structure in the magnetosphere promoting the onset is the near-Earth dynamo in the inner magnetospheric region away from the equatorial plane. The near-Earth dynamo is driven by the field-aligned pressure increase due to the parallel flow associated with the squeezing, combined with equatorward field-perpendicular flow induced by the near-Earth neutral line (NENL). The dipolarization front is launched from the NENL associated with the convection transient from the growth phase to the expansion phase, but neither the launch nor the arrival of the dipolarization front coincides with the onset timing. The arrival of flow to the equatorial plane of the inner magnetosphere occurs 2 min after the onset, when the WTS starts to develop toward the west. The expansion phase is further developed by this flow. Looking at the present result that the onset sequence induced by the near-Earth dynamo reproduces the details of observation quite well, we cannot avoid to conclude that the current wedge is a misleading concept.",

The increase of upward vertical winds over the magnetic equator associated with the additional divergence of meridional winds, caused by the inclusion of field-aligned ion drag, leads to a reduction in thermosphere temperature and density at the magnetic equator through enhanced adiabatic cooling. We found that the field-aligned ion drag has an obvious impact on the thermosphere only over the magnetic equatorial region in the daytime and evening sectors, whereas it has less effect on the equatorial thermosphere anomaly (ETA) crests. The daytime neutral temperature over the magnetic equator is reduced by about 30 K, for altitudes above 250 km without significant altitudinal variations, when field-aligned ion drag is included in the simulation. The thermosphere density in the magnetic equatorial region starts to change slightly at 300 km and depletes by about 5% at 400 km, while experiencing a greater decrease with altitude. Furthermore, the trough produced in the neutral temperature and density corresponds well with the magnetic dip equator. The ETA features during 12:00-18:00 LT become obvious as a result of the inclusion of the field-aligned ion drag. Specifically, our results show that at 400 km the crest-trough differences in neutral temperature are about 30-60 K, and the crest-trough ratios in thermosphere density are 1.03-1.06, comparable with observations.",

We present Cluster multispacecraft observations of Poynting fluxes associated with abrupt changes in large-scale electric fields during sudden commencements and southward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The Cluster spacecraft detected Poynting fluxes dominated by the field-aligned upward component during the preliminary impulse of sudden commencements and in the initial period after southward turning of the IMF. The upward Poynting flux indicates existence of Alfv\u00e9n waves transporting electromagnetic energy from the ionosphere toward the magnetosphere leading to magnetospheric convection changes. The waveguide model and global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation calculating evolution of the Poynting flux following solar wind pressure enhancements also show upward Poynting fluxes propagating from the ionosphere toward the magnetosphere faster than the propagation of compressional waves. We conclude that the ionosphere acts as a channel to transmit electromagnetic energy supplied as field-aligned currents toward a wide region in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system instantaneously, leading to changes in magnetospheric convection electric fields.",

         "abstract": "During the interval from 06:15 to 07:30 UT on 24 August 2005, the Chinese Tan-Ce 1 (TC1) satellite observed the multiple responses of the near-Earth magnetotail to the combined changes in solar wind dynamic pressure and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The magnetotail was highly compressed by a strong interplanetary shock because of the dynamic pressure enhancement (\u223c15 nPa), and the large shrinkage of magnetotail made a northern lobe and plasma mantle move inward to the position of the inbound TC1 that was initially in the plasma sheet. Meanwhile, the dynamic pressure fluctuations (\u223c0.5-3 nPa) behind the shock drove the quasi-periodic oscillations of the magnetopause, lobe-mantle boundary, and geomagnetic field at the same frequencies: one dominant frequency was around 3 mHz and the other was around 5 mHz. The quasi-periodic oscillations of the lobe-mantle boundary caused the alternate entries of TC1 into the northern lobe and the plasma mantle. In contrast to a single squeezed or deformed magnetotail by a solar wind discontinuity moving tailward, the compressed and oscillating magnetotail can better indicate the dynamic evolution of magnetotail when solar wind dynamic pressure increases and fluctuates remarkably, and the near-Earth magnetotail is quite sensitive even to some small changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure when it is highly compressed. Furthermore, it is found that a considerable amount of oxygen ions (O<SUP>+</SUP>) appeared in the lobe after the southward turning of IMF.",

Performing a set of numerical experiments with a general circulation model whose middle atmospheric dynamical and thermodynamical fields were constrained using a numerical weather prediction system, we simulate the effects of SSWs and MCs on light chemical species, and via comparisons with two data sets taken from the mesosphere and thermosphere, we quantify the associated variability in light species abundances and mass density. Large depletions in the observed and modeled polar H abundance in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) occur with MC onset, as opposed to SSW onset. Depletions in all light thermospheric species at high northern latitudes extend up to the exobase in our model simulations during the January 2013 SSW/MC period, with the largest depletions simulated for the lightest species. Further, our modeling work substantiates the paradigm of increased mixing in the MLT driven by a meridional residual circulation during SSWs resulting from enhanced small-scale gravity wave and migrating semidiurnal tidal forcing; the former being the primary driver and the latter of secondary but notable importance in our model simulations. SSW/MC induced light species variability then gets projected upward into the thermosphere through molecular diffusion. Modeled light species variability during the January 2013 SSW/MC event suggests SSW/MC signatures could be present in the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere.",

         "abstract": "Auroral arcs are often associated with magnetically quiet time and substorm growth phases. We have studied the evolution of auroral structures during global and local magnetic activity to investigate the occurrence rate of auroral arcs during different levels of magnetic activity. The ground-magnetic and auroral conditions are described by the magnetometer and auroral camera data from five Magnetometers \u2014 Ionospheric radars \u2014 All-sky cameras Large Experiment stations in Finnish and Swedish Lapland. We identified substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases from the local electrojet index (IL) in 1996-2007 and analyzed the auroral structures during the different phases. Auroral structures were also analyzed during different global magnetic activity levels, as described by the planetary Kp index. The distribution of auroral structures for all substorm phases and Kp levels is of similar shape. About one third of all detected structures are auroral arcs. This suggests that auroral arcs occur in all conditions as the main element of the aurora. The most arc-dominated substorm phases occur in the premidnight sector, while the least arc-dominated substorm phases take place in the dawn sector. Arc event lifetimes and expectation times calculated for different substorm phases show that the longest arc-dominated periods are found during growth phases, while the longest arc waiting times occur during expansion phases. Most of the arc events end when arcs evolve to more complex structures. This is true for all substorm phases. Based on the number of images of auroral arcs and the durations of substorm phases, we conclude that a randomly selected auroral arc most likely belongs to a substorm expansion phase. A small time delay, of the order of a minute, is observed between the magnetic signature of the substorm onset (i.e., the beginning of the negative bay) and the auroral breakup (i.e., the growth phase arc changing into a dynamic display). The magnetic onset was observed to precede the structural change in the auroral display. A longer delay of a few minutes was found between the beginning of the growth phase and the first detected auroral structure.",

         "abstract": "Accurate evaluation of the physical processes during the substorm growth phase, including formation of field-aligned currents (FACs), isotropization by current sheet scattering, instabilities, and ionosphere-magnetosphere connection, relies on knowing the realistic three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic field configuration, which cannot be reliably provided by current available empirical models. We have established a 3-D substorm growth phase magnetic field model, which is uniquely constructed from empirical plasma sheet pressures under the constraint of force balance. We investigated the evolution of model pressure and magnetic field responding to increasing energy loading and their configurations under different solar wind dynamic pressure (P<SUB>SW</SUB>) and sunspot number. Our model reproduces the typical growth phase evolution signatures: plasma pressure increases, magnetic field lines become more stretched, current sheet becomes thinner, and the Region 2 FACs are enhanced. The model magnetic fields agree quantitatively well with observed fields. The magnetic field is substantially more stretched under higher P<SUB>SW</SUB>, while the dependence on sunspot number is nonlinear and less substantial. By applying our modeling to a substorm event, we found that (1) the equatorward movement of proton aurora during the growth phase is mainly due to continuous stretching of magnetic field lines, (2) the ballooning instability is more favorable during late growth phase around midnight tail where there is a localized plasma beta peak, and (3) the equatorial mapping of the breakup auroral arc is at X~-14 R<SUB>E</SUB> near midnight, coinciding with the location of the maximum growth rate for the ballooning instability.",

Geotail has made more than 50 encounters with magnetic reconnection in association with the onset of substorms in the near-Earth magnetotail at radial distances of 20-30 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the period of 1994-2019. Ground magnetic field observations are examined for these events, and geosynchronous spacecraft observations are investigated for a limited number of cases. The magnetic reconnection site is located in the upward (from the ionosphere to the tail) field-aligned current part of large-scale substorm current system derived from ground midlatitude magnetic variations. The site is confined to the localized dawn-dusk extent of the 1-hr local time, just west of the center of the large-scale substorm current system. The short dawn-dusk length of the X-line implies that magnetic reconnection inherently proceeds as the two-dimensional dynamics in the magnetotail meridional plane. Rapid dipolarization with upward field-aligned currents occurs at geosynchronous altitude near the meridian of the magnetic reconnection site. This study demonstrates that rapid dipolarization in the inner magnetosphere is produced with earthward outflows from magnetic reconnection and that intense upward field-aligned currents are a direct consequence of magnetic reconnection.",

         "abstract": "A planet's magnetosheath extends from downstream of its bow shock up to the magnetopause, where the solar wind flow is deflected around the magnetosphere and the solar wind-embedded magnetic field lines are draped. This makes the region an important site for plasma turbulence, instabilities, reconnection, and plasma depletion layers. A relatively high Alfv\u00e9n Mach number solar wind and a polar-flattened magnetosphere make the magnetosheath of Saturn both physically and geometrically distinct from the Earth's. The polar flattening is predicted to affect the magnetosheath magnetic field structure and thus the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Here we investigate the magnetic field in the magnetosheath with the expectation that polar flattening is manifested in the overall draping pattern. We compare an accumulation of Cassini data between 2004 and 2010 with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and an analytical model representative of a draped field between axisymmetric boundaries. The draping patterns measured are well captured and in broad agreement for given upstream conditions with those of the MHD simulations (which include polar flattening). The deviations from the analytical model, based on no polar flattening, suggest that nonaxisymmetry is invariably a key feature of the magnetosphere's global structure. Our results show a comprehensive overview of the configuration of the magnetic field in a nonaxisymmetric magnetosheath as revealed by Cassini. We anticipate our assessment to provide an insight to this barely studied interface between a high Alfv\u00e9nic bow shock and a dynamic magnetosphere.",

During northward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) Bz conditions, the magnetosphere acts as a closed \"cavity\" and reacts to solar wind DPPs more simply than during southward IMF. In this study we use solar wind data collected by ACE and WIND together with magnetic field observations of Geotail, Cluster, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), Van Allen Probes, GOES missions, and ground magnetometer arrays to observe the magnetosphere (dayside, nightside, inner magnetosphere, magnetotail, magnetosheath, etc.) and ionosphere response simultaneously in several local time sectors and regions. A total of 37 events were selected during the period between February 2007 to December 2017. We examine the global response of each event and identify systematic behavior of the magnetosphere due to DPPs' compression, such as MHD wave propagation, sudden impulses, and Ultra Low Frequency waves (ULF) in the Pc5 range. Our results confirm statistical studies with a more limited coverage that have been performed at different sectors and/or regions of the magnetosphere. We present observations of the different signatures generated in different regions that propagate through the magnetosphere. The signature of the tailward traveling DPP is observed to move at the same solar wind speed, and in superposition of other known magnetospheric perturbations. It is observed that the DPP also generates or increases the amplitude of Pc4 5 waves observed in the inner magnetosphere, while similar waves are observed on the ground.",

         "abstract": "We have performed a statistical study investigating how substorm triggering and unloading is affected by the heavy ion content of the magnetotail plasma sheet. During the substorm growth phase, magnetic flux is accumulated in the tail lobes until the magnetotail reaches an unstable state. A near-Earth neutral line then forms, and this excess flux is reconnected. The increased lobe magnetic flux during the substorm growth phase increases the magnetopause flaring angle. As a result, a greater fraction of the solar-wind dynamic pressure is observed in the tail lobes and plasma sheet. Therefore, the increase and decrease of the lobe magnetic flux can be monitored by observing the increase and decrease in the magnetotail pressure. Using Cluster data from 2001 to 2004, we have determined how the maximum pressure (or flaring angle) and the rate of change of pressure (or flaring angle) during substorms depend on the O<SUP>+</SUP> content of the plasma sheet. In addition, we have estimated the maximum magnetic flux, and rate of change of the magnetic flux. Our results show that both the maximum tail pressure and the rate of change in the pressure are positively correlated with the amount of O<SUP>+</SUP> in the plasma sheet. When the measurements are normalized to account for the external solar-wind pressure and the different Cluster locations in the tail, the maximum accumulated flux and the unloading rate still correlate positively with the O<SUP>+</SUP> density and O<SUP>+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> ratio. This suggests that the additional O<SUP>+</SUP> makes it more difficult to trigger the substorm onset, but once it is triggered, the unloading is faster. This could either indicate that the presence of O<SUP>+</SUP> increases the reconnection rate, or that it initiates reconnection over a broader width of the tail.",

         "abstract": "fluxes of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) measured by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft reveal a Ribbon of strong emission whose source lies beyond the termination shock. Intense emissions of ENAs (energies 0.1 to 6 keV) appear along an extended arc significantly displaced from the nose of the heliosphere, the point on the boundary defined by the Sun's motion relative to the local interstellar medium (LISM). The locus of the Ribbon differs from expectations based on early models of the interaction of the solar wind with the LISM, assumed to flow at a super-Alfv\u00e9nic speed. Here we argue that the distribution of the ENA source can be understood if the flow is sub-Alfv\u00e9nic. We use a magnetohydrodynamic model of the mini-magnetosphere of Ganymede, embedded in the sub-Alfv\u00e9nic flow of Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma, to establish where heated ions are distributed on the magnetopause. If the flow of the LISM is sub-Alfv\u00e9nic, reconnection would occur along an arc centered away from the nose for an appropriately chosen field orientation. Charge exchange with ions heated by reconnection would produce an ENA source distributed in a manner close to that observed. Heating of ions by reconnection can account also for the way ENA images vary with energy. Sub-Alfv\u00e9nic flow implies not only that reconnection on the heliopause can be centered well away from the nose, but also that no bow shock forms upstream of the heliopause. It also seems probable that the configuration of the heliosphere differs from the bullet shape frequently illustrated.",

         "abstract": "Similar to Earth, Mercury's magnetotail experiences frequent dipolarization of the magnetic field. These rapid (~2 s) increases in the northward component of the tail field (\u0394B<SUB>z</SUB> ~ 30 nT) at Mercury are associated with fast sunward flows (~200 km/s) that enhance local magnetic field convection. Differences between the two magnetospheres, namely Mercury's smaller spatiotemporal scales and lack of an ionosphere, influence the dynamics of dipolarizations in these magnetotails. At Earth, the braking of fast dipolarization flows near the inner magnetosphere accumulates magnetic flux and develops the substorm current wedge. At Mercury, flow braking and flux pileup remain open topics. In this work, we develop an automated algorithm to identify dipolarizations, which allows for statistical examination of flow braking and flux pileup in Mercury's magnetotail. We find that near the inner edge of the plasma sheet, steep magnetic pressure gradients cause substantial braking of fast dipolarization flows. The dipolarization frequency and sunward flow speed decrease significantly within a region ~500 km thick located at ~900 km altitude above Mercury's local midnight surface. Due to the close proximity of the braking region to the planet, we estimate that ~10-20% of dipolarizations may reach the nightside surface of the planet. The remaining dipolarizations exhibit prolonged statistical flux pileup within the braking region similar to large-scale dipolarization of Earth's inner magnetosphere. The existence of flow braking and flux pileup at Mercury indicates that a current wedge may form, although the limitations imposed by Mercury's magnetosphere require the braking of multiple, continuous dipolarizations for current wedge formation.",

         "abstract": "This work investigates middle atmosphere effects of the September 2005 solar flares and solar proton events (SPEs). X-17 and X-6.2 flares occurred on 7 and 9 September, respectively, while two moderate SPEs occurred on 10 and 15 September. Flare ionization and dissociation were calculated in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) using the Flare Irradiance Spectral Model. Proton measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system were used to compute solar proton ionization. SPEs are shown to have a larger impact than solar flares on the polar stratosphere and mesosphere; however, flares have a larger influence on the sunlit and equatorial lower thermosphere. The two flares differed significantly with respect to photon spectrum. The larger, X-17 flare was stronger during the impulsive phase, while the X-6.2 flare was stronger during the gradual phase. This resulted in the X-17 flare causing more initial ionization but for a shorter duration. The simulated flare impacts also differed because specific wavelengths of the flares influenced the atmosphere above the model top. Model-measurement comparisons show that WACCM captures the overall timing and spatial distribution of the observed electron enhancements, indicating a reasonable simulation of flare and SPE-induced ionization. Both the SPEs and flares caused odd nitrogen increases in the mesosphere. Odd hydrogen produced in the lower mesosphere by the SPEs led to short-lived ozone decreases of nearly 100%. The flares caused small temperature increases in the lower thermosphere but had no effect on the stratosphere.",

         "abstract": "Magnetosheath jets are localized fast flows with enhanced dynamic pressure. When they supermagnetosonically compress the ambient magnetosheath plasma, a bow wave or shock can form ahead of them. Such a bow wave was recently observed to accelerate ions and possibly electrons. The ion acceleration process was previously analyzed, but the electron acceleration process remains largely unexplored. Here we use multipoint observations by Time History of Events and Macroscale during Substorms from three events to determine whether and how magnetosheath jet-driven bow waves can accelerate electrons. We show that when suprathermal electrons in the ambient magnetosheath convect toward a bow wave, some electrons are shock-drift accelerated and reflected toward the ambient magnetosheath and others continue moving downstream of the bow wave resulting in bidirectional motion. Our study indicates that magnetosheath jet-driven bow waves can result in additional energization of suprathermal electrons in the magnetosheath. It implies that magnetosheath jets can increase the efficiency of electron acceleration at planetary bow shocks or other similar astrophysical environments.",

         "abstract": "The Polar Cap (PC) index has been approved by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA XXII Assembly, Merida, Mexico, 2013) as a new index of magnetic activity. The PC index can be considered to be a proxy of the solar wind energy that enters the magnetosphere. This distinguishes PC from AL and Dst indices that are more related to the dissipation of energy through auroral currents or storage of energy in the ring current during magnetic substorms or storms. The association of the PC index with the direct coupling of the solar wind energy into the magnetosphere is based upon analysis of the relationship of PC with parameters in the solar wind, on the one hand, and correlation between the time series of PC and the AL index (substorm development), on the other hand. This paper (the first of a series) provides the results of statistical investigations that demonstrate a strong correlation between the behavior of PC and the development of magnetic substorms. Substorms are classified as isolated and expanded. We found that (1) substorms are preceded by growth in the RS index, (2) sudden substorm expansion onsets are related to \"leap\" or \"reverse\" signatures in the PC index which are indicative of a sharp increase in the PC growth rate, (3) substorms start to develop when PC exceeds a threshold level 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mV/m irrespective of the length of the substorm growth phase, and (4) there is a linear relation between the intensity of substorms and PC for all substorm events.",

Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms A in the near-Earth magnetotail observed flux-enhanced electrons of 300 keV during the magnetic field dipolarization. Geosynchronous orbit satellites also observed the intensive electron injections. Located in the outer radiation belt, RBSP-A observed enhancements of MeV electrons accompanied by substorm dipolarization. The phase space density (PSD) of MeV electrons at L<SUP>*</SUP> 5.4 increased by 1 order of magnitude in 1 h, resulting in a local PSD peak of MeV electrons, which was caused by the direct effect of substorm injections. Enhanced MeV electrons in the heart of the outer radiation belt were also detected within 2 h, which may be associated with intensive substorm electron injections and subsequent local acceleration by chorus waves. Multipoint observations have shown that substorm electron injections not only can be the external source of MeV electrons at the outer edge of the outer radiation belt (L<SUP>*</SUP> 5.4) but also can provide the intensive seed populations in the outer radiation belt. These initial higher-energy electrons from injection can reach relativistic energy much faster. The observations also provide evidence that enhanced substorm electron injections can explain rapid enhancements of MeV electrons in the outer radiation belt.",

We simulate three unique events of solar wind pressure enhancements that occurred during negative, near-zero, and positive interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>z</SUB>. Then, we examine the behavior of the dayside and nightside reconnection rates and quantify their respective contributions to cross polar cap potential (CPCP), a proxy of ionospheric plasma convection strength. The modeled CPCP increases after a P<SUB>sw</SUB> enhancement in all three cases, which agrees well with observations from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program spacecraft and predictions from the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics technique. In the OpenGGCM-CTIM model, dayside reconnection increases within 9-13 min of the pressure impact, while nightside reconnection intensifies about 13-25 min after the pressure increase. As the strong P<SUB>sw</SUB> compresses the dayside magnetosheath and, subsequently, the magnetotail, their magnetic fields intensify and activate stronger antiparallel reconnection on the dayside magnetopause first and near the central plasma sheet second. For southward IMF, dayside reconnection contributes to the CPCP enhancement 2-4 times more than nightside reconnection. For northward IMF, the dayside contribution weakens, and nightside reconnection contributes more to the CPCP enhancement. We find that high-latitude magnetopause reconnection during northward IMF produces sunward ionospheric plasma convection, which decreases the typical dawn-to-dusk ionosphere electric field. This results in a weaker dayside reconnection contribution to the CPCP during northward IMF.",

More specifically, the spectra observed by Voyager 2 in a wide range of heliospheric distances from 6 to 90 astronomical units (AU) are compared with those of Voyager 1 already analyzed between 7 and 107 AU. We focus on the singularity multifractal spectrum before and after crossing the termination heliospheric shock by Voyager 1 at 94 AU and Voyager 2 at 84 AU from the Sun. It is worth noting that the spectrum is prevalently right-skewed inside the whole heliosphere. Moreover, we have observed a change of the asymmetry of the spectrum at the termination shock, where the spectrum changes from (left-) right-skewed in the very distant heliosphere to the (right-) left-skewed or possibly symmetric spectrum in the heliosheath. We confirm that the degree of multifractality falls steadily with the distance from the Sun. In addition, the multifractal structure is apparently modulated by the solar activity, with a time shift of several years, corresponding to a distance of about 10 AU, resulting from the evolution of the whole heliosphere. Hence this basic result also brings significant additional support to some earlier claims suggesting that the solar wind termination shock is asymmetric.",

This scenario elaborated by Dungey (1963) can explain many aspects of solar wind-magnetosphere interaction processes, including substorms. However, neither the Dungey model nor its numerous modifications were able to explain fully the onset conditions for MR in the tail. In this paper, we introduce new onset conditions for forced MR in the tail. We call our scenario the \"windsock memory conditioned ram pressure effect.\" Our nonflux transfer-associated forcing is introduced by a combination of the large-scale windsock motions exhibiting memory effects and solar wind dynamic pressure actions on the nightside magnetopause during northward oriented interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Using global MHD Grand Unified Magnetosphere Ionosphere Coupling Simulation version 4 simulation results, upstream data from Wind, magnetosheath data from Cluster 1 and distant tail data from the two-probe Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun mission, we show that the simultaneous occurrence of vertical windsock motions of the magnetotail and enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure introduces strong nightside disturbances, including enhanced electric fields and persistent vertical cross-tail shear flows. These perturbations, associated with a stream interaction region in the solar wind, drive MR in the tail during episodes of northward oriented interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We detect MR indirectly, observing plasmoids in the tail and ground-based signatures of earthward moving fast flows. We also consider the application to solar system planets and close-in exoplanets, where the proposed scenario can elucidate some new aspects of solar/stellar wind-magnetosphere interactions.",

         "abstract": "We report on the dynamics of low-altitude energetic neutral atom (ENA) emissions during two substorms that occurred during the main phases of two storms: (1) a CIR-driven storm on 11 October 2008 and (2) a coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven storm on 5 April 2010. For both of these storms, we have complementary spacecraft and ground-based observations. The dual-spacecraft Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers (TWINS) mission obtained ENA images containing low-altitude emissions (LAEs). Substorm dynamics is inferred from THEMIS all-sky imagers. TWINS-observed LAEs are compared with trapped/loss cone proton fluxes from the low-altitude NOAA/MetOp spacecraft constellation. We find that the timing and intensity profiles of LAEs are different for the two selected events. For the 11 October 2008 event, the LAEs rise during substorm recovery phase and storm main phase. On 5 April 2010, the LAEs tend to peak near substorm onset. We argue that the different LAE behavior results from different pitch-angle distributions (PADs) of the ion source population. Ion PADs are isotropic during substorm recovery phase for the 11 October 2008 event and have empty loss cone for the 5 April 2010 event. For both cases, LAE intensification marks the onset of activity in the magnetotail and precedes the large substorm onset. We conclude that the LAE production starts in the transition region between the magnetotail and ring current and may expand/move into the inner magnetosphere together with ring current formation.",

In order to evaluate whether R1 and R2 currents contribute to the substorm current wedge, we rotate global maps of Birkeland currents into a common coordinate system centered on the magnetic local time of substorm onset. When the latitude of substorm is taken into account, it is clear that both R1 and R2 current systems play a role in substorm onset, contrary to previous studies which found that R2 current did not contribute. The latitude of substorm onset is colocated with the interface between R1 and R2 currents, allowing us to infer that R1 current closes just tailward and R2 current closes just earthward of the associated current disruption in the tail. AMPERE is the first data set to give near-instantaneous measurements of Birkeland current across the whole polar cap, and this study addresses apparent discrepancies in previous studies which have used AMPERE to examine the morphology of the substorm current wedge. Finally, we present evidence for an extremely localized reduction in current density immediately prior to substorm onset, and we interpret this as the first statistical signature of auroral dimming in Birkeland current.",

During an SSW event, the mesosphere at high latitudes cools, and the lower thermosphere becomes warm. At the peak of the SSW event, a temperature drop occurs above an altitude of 150 km at high latitudes. Our results indicate that the SSW event strongly affects meridional circulation and GW drag in the thermosphere. In the lower thermosphere, upward wind in the Arctic region, southward wind in the region between the North Pole and the South Pole, and downward wind in the Antarctic region are dominant before SSW occurs. The SSW event reverses meridional circulation at altitudes between 90 and 125 km in the Northern Hemisphere. During the SSW event, downward wind in the Arctic region and northward wind in the Northern Hemisphere prevail in the lower thermosphere. A detailed analysis revealed that during the SSW event, the change in meridional circulation is caused by the attenuation of the GW drag, and we identified the mechanism responsible for this attenuation. Moreover, we assessed the impacts of SSW on temperatures in the equatorial region and Southern Hemisphere.",

         "abstract": "A case of the major intensification of the subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) during the substorm recovery phase is presented. The continuous high-time-resolution Doppler velocity measurements in the subauroral and auroral regions were conducted with the Unwin HF radar, and these are analyzed in the context of the simultaneous and coincident measurements of the auroral luminosity and the total electron content (TEC) by the IMAGE and GPS satellites. Additional information was provided by other SuperDARN radars, DMSP F15 satellite crossing the fully-developed SAPS region, ground-based measurements near the location of the substorm onset, and GOES and LANL satellites in the inner magnetosphere. The association between the SAPS and TEC trough is further substantiated at short timescales and TEC is shown to exhibit two distinct types of responses to substorm onset poleward of and within SAPS, with no evidence of a TEC decrease during SAPS intensification. It is argued that the positive feedback between the electric fields and electron densities was probably not responsible for the observed SAPS intensification. Moreover, it is proposed that the strong and steady plasma acceleration within SAPS may be triggered by a burst of auroral activity, rather than accompanied by a similarly steady variation in other observed parameters either in the ionosphere or in the inner magnetosphere. It is also argued that the SAPS intensification occurring during the recovery phase is not necessarily expected from the current models of the SAPS formation and evolution, but is consistent with the observationally-based view of a fully-developed SAPS as a substorm recovery phenomenon.",

In the high-latitude region, observations show that ion and neutral motions are strongly coupled when the aurora is present but the coupling is less evident when there is no aurora. In this study, we investigate the ability of the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) to simulate the mesoscale wind structure over Alaska during a substorm. Thirteen distinct numerical simulations of a substorm event that occurred between 02:00 and 17:00 Universal Time on 24 November 2012 have been performed. Distinct drivers considered include the Weimer and SuperDARN potential patterns and the OVATION Prime and OVATION-SME auroral models. The effects of the boundary between the neutral wind dynamo calculation and the high-latitude imposed electric potential were also considered. Neutral wind velocities and thermospheric temperatures measured by the Scanning Doppler Imager instruments located at three locations in Alaska were compared to GITM simulation results, and electron densities within GITM were compared to data from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. It was found that the different drivers used between multiple simulations lead to various amounts of momentum coupling within the simulation, affecting the accuracy of the modeled neutral and ion flow patterns and the strength of electron precipitation at high latitudes. This affirms that better observations of auroral precipitation and electric fields are required to accurately understand and consistently reproduce the mesoscale neutral wind flow patterns and temperature structure in the high-latitude thermosphere.",

         "abstract": "the present study we observationally address the role of ionospheric conductivity in the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling in terms of global field-aligned currents (FACs). Solar EUV irradiance changes during a solar cycle and so does its contribution to the ionospheric conductivity. We statistically examine how, under fixed external conditions, the intensities of the R1 and R2 currents and their demarcation latitude depend on solar activity (F<SUB>10.7</SUB>). An emphasis is placed on nightside FACs in the dark hemisphere. The result shows that for fixed ranges of interplanetary electric field, the nightside FACs are more intense for higher solar activity irrespective of their polarities or local times. It is also found that the R1-R2 pair, therefore the auroral oval, moves equatorward as the solar activity increases. For both current intensity and latitude, the dependence on F<SUB>10.7</SUB> is more sensitive at smaller F<SUB>10.7</SUB> and it levels off with increasing F<SUB>10.7</SUB>. The intensities of dayside FACs reveal similar F<SUB>10.7</SUB> dependence as expected from the enhancement of the local ionospheric conductance. Interestingly, they also move equatorward with increasing F<SUB>10.7</SUB>. It is expected from force balance that as the dayside R1 current becomes more intense with increasing solar activity, the magnetosphere shrinks on the day side and expands on the night side. This configurational change of the magnetosphere presumably affects the energy transport from the solar wind to the magnetosphere, although its details still remain to be understood. We conclude that the ionospheric conductivity plays an active role in the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

         "abstract": "VLF waves excited by powerful ground-based transmitters propagate in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide and leak through the ionosphere to the magnetosphere, where they are often recorded by satellites. Simulations of the propagation of whistler waves using coupled transionospheric VLF propagation and three-dimensional ray-tracing models have shown systematic overestimates of the VLF wavefield strength near 20 kHz in the magnetosphere by about 20 dB in the night and 10 dB during the day. The paper presents numerical simulations of the conversion between whistler and lower hybrid waves interactions in the presence of short-scale field-aligned density irregularities (striations) in Earth's lower ionosphere. The simulations, which incorporate a realistic ionospheric density profile, show that the mode conversion of whistler waves to lower hybrid waves leads to significant attenuation of whistler waves at altitudes between 90 and 150 km. The striation width plays an important role in the conversion efficiency between whistler and lower hybrid wave. Uniformly distributed striations with 8 m transverse size result in 15 dB attenuation in the 90-150 km propagation range, while a spectrum from 2 to 10 m results in 9 dB attenuation. It is argued that the attenuation of whistler waves in the presence of short-scale density striations in Earth's ionosphere can account for most of the observed \u223c20 dB loss in VLF intensity. Furthermore, it predicts that VLF/ELF waves with frequencies below 5 kHz will not suffer similar attenuation.",

         "abstract": "The effects of the leading edge stream interface of high-speed solar-wind streams (HSSs) upon the Earth's magnetosphere have been extensively documented. The arrival of HSSs leads to significant changes in the plasmasphere, plasma sheet, ring current, and radiation belts, during the evolution from slow solar wind to persistent fast solar wind. Studies have also documented effects in the lower ionosphere and the neutral atmosphere. However, only cursory attention has been paid to the trailing-edge stream interface during the transition back from fast solar wind to slow solar wind. Here we report on the statistical changes that occur in the plasmasphere, plasma sheet, ring current, and electron radiation belt during the passage of the trailing-edge stream interface of HSSs, when the magnetosphere is in most respects in an extremely quiescent state. Counterintuitively, the peak flux of 1 MeV electrons is observed to occur at this interface. In contrast, other regions of the magnetosphere demonstrate extremely quiet conditions. As with the leading-edge stream interface, the occurrence of the trailing-edge stream interface has a periodicity of 27 days, and hence, understanding the changes that occur in the magnetosphere during the passage of trailing edges of HSSs can lead to improved forecasting and predictability of the magnetosphere as a system.",

         "abstract": "Recently, images from the THEMIS all-sky imager array were used to suggest that longitudinally localized enhanced plasma transport across the nightside open-closed boundary (separatrix) \u223c5.5 min before substorm onset leads to intrusion of new plasma toward the near-Earth plasma sheet and to substorm onset via near-Earth instability. If such reconnection-related flow enhancements precede substorm onsets, they should be seen along the entire length of separatrix field lines within the appropriate longitudinal region as perpendicular flow before onset. Evidence for such flows has been previously reported for four events over a limited radial extent. Based on 13 substorm events with at least one of the THEMIS spacecraft near the outer boundary of the plasma sheet in the premidnight region and simultaneous auroral images, we find here that enhanced flows toward the plasma sheet center are often seen (11 of 13 events) in the premidnight sector a few minutes prior to onset from X \u223c -11 to -26 R<SUB>E</SUB>. Previous radar observations within the ionosphere have also shown that such enhanced flows bringing new plasma into the auroral zone from polar cap field lines prior to onset are common. Assuming that the outer boundary of the plasma sheet approximately demarcates the open-closed field line boundary, these results indicate that reconnection-related flow enhancements do indeed precede substorm onset along the entire radial extent of the plasma sheet outer boundary. Consistent with longitudinal localization, enhanced flows toward the plasma sheet center were not observed on all spacecraft for five events where there were more than one spacecraft near the plasma sheet boundary.",

         "abstract": "There are two schools of thought regarding the excitation mechanism of low-latitude Pi2 pulsations. One is the cavity mode resonance, which is established by fast mode waves that are emitted at substorm onset and form the standing oscillation within the plasmasphere. The other is the bursty bulk flow (BBF)-driven process, in which periodical BBFs traveling from the magnetotail cause pressure pulses in the inner magnetosphere, generating Pi2 pulsations. This study intends to examine which of these two excitation mechanisms is more plausible. A working assumption is that in the case of the cavity mode resonance the wave period of Pi2 pulsations depends on the size and the plasma mass density of the plasmasphere, while in the case of the BBF-driven process the wave period is controlled by the BBF period and is independent of the plasmaspheric parameters. We investigated long-term variation in wave period of Pi2 pulsations observed at the Kakioka observatory for the period from March 1983 to October 2009. Multiple correlation analysis revealed that the Pi2 period is negatively correlated with the \u03a3Kp index and positively correlated with ion mass in the near-Earth plasma sheet or the F10.7 index. The \u03a3Kp index is considered as a proxy for the size of the plasmasphere, and the plasma sheet ion mass or the F10.7 index can be considered as a proxy for the mass density of the plasmasphere, indicating that the Pi2 period is proportional to both the size and mass density of the plasmasphere. This result strongly supports the plasmaspheric cavity mode resonance as an excitation mechanism of low-latitude Pi2 pulsations.",

         "abstract": "We use the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science/Langmuir probe measurements of the electron density from the first 110 flybys of Titan to study how Saturn's magnetosphere influences Titan's ionosphere. The data is first corrected for biased sampling due to varying solar zenith angle and solar energy flux (solar cycle effects). We then present results showing that the electron density in Titan's ionosphere, in the altitude range 1600-2400 km, is increased by about a factor of 2.5 when Titan is located on the nightside of Saturn (Saturn local time (SLT) 21-03 h) compared to when on the dayside (SLT 09-15 h). For lower altitudes (1100-1600 km) the main dividing factor for the ionospheric density is the ambient magnetospheric conditions. When Titan is located in the magnetospheric current sheet, the electron density in Titan's ionosphere is about a factor of 1.4 higher compared to when Titan is located in the magnetospheric lobes. The factor of 1.4 increase in between sheet and lobe flybys is interpreted as an effect of increased particle impact ionization from \u223c200 eV sheet electrons. The factor of 2.5 increase in electron density between flybys on Saturn's nightside and dayside is suggested to be an effect of the pressure balance between thermal plus magnetic pressure in Titan's ionosphere against the dynamic pressure and energetic particle pressure in Saturn's magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Cluster multipoint measurements are used to study two successive magnetosheath flux transfer events (FTEs). Magnetic field lines in the leading region are found to be closed magnetospheric field lines. For event 1 these field lines are wounded up by a large current structure oriented eastward and moving poleward. Conversely, the trailing region corresponds to opened magnetic field lines. For both events the leading edge of the FTEs is a tangential discontinuity separating the magnetosheath from closed field lines. In the case of event 1 magnetosheath ions are accelerated through the FTE trailing edge via a rotational discontinuity and penetrate on closed field lines through a second discontinuity. Thus, the ion jet is accelerated equatorward of the spacecraft but the backtracking of the discontinuities and the lack of dispersion show that ion acceleration occurs at less than 2 R<SUB>E</SUB> from Cluster. On the other hand the extrapolation forward indicates that the FTE bulge steepens as in simulations of Dorelli and Bhattacharjee). Evidence is given for the penetration of magnetosheath ions inside the core of the FTE, on closed field lines. Magnetosheath electrons are accelerated in parallel and antiparallel directions on open and on closed field lines, thus breaking the frozen-in condition. Event 2 is also split in two distinct regions but no evidence is found for accelerated bidirectional magnetosheath electrons. For event 2 the two discontinuities at the trailing region are stacked together when they are crossed by the spacecraft, suggesting that the current splitting is a reconnection signature.",

         "abstract": "We analyzed simultaneous Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) probes and ground-based observations during a set of successive auroral activations between 0600 and 0900 UT on 27 February 2009. The first (minor) activation, interpreted as a pseudobreakup, may be related to transient reconnection on closed plasma sheet field lines. During the pseudobreakup, a plasmoid was observed in the midtail. Other minor auroral activations were associated with earthward flow bursts accompanied by magnetic field disturbance in the near-Earth plasma sheet. The effects of these minor activations (auroral brightening and ground responses) were limited in spatial scale, and weak or local variations in the near-Earth magnetotail were observed. The slow but continuous increase in total lobe pressure suggests continuous flux accumulation in the magnetotail. A new reconnection episode likely occurred in the magnetotail, as evidenced by fast earthward flows (600\u223c800 km/s) accompanied by B<SUB>z</SUB> &gt; 0 observed by P1 and P2 at \u223c0738 UT. At substorm expansion, an abrupt reduction in the lobe field at P5 (which had been increasing continuously) was observed. The rapid lobe flux reduction may indicate magnetotail lobe magnetic reconnection (TLR) and evolution of the expansion phase. Substorm expansion onset, as evidenced by a global expansion of auroral intensification and strong ground Pi2 pulsations, was accompanied by a decrease in total pressure and significant dipolarization and electron injections in the near-Earth magnetotail. We interpret these minor activations (including a pseudobreakup and other minor activations at \u223c0657 and \u223c0705 UT) as precursors of a substorm onset. In this scenario, closed field line reconnection results in ionospheric effects consistent with very localized auroral intensifications, including limited poleward expansion. TLR provides most of the flux and energy required for fully developed substorms.",

         "abstract": "This paper uses Cluster data during the period from 2001 to 2010 to study the polytropic processes of magnetosheath ions. Utilizing the method of homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Bernoulli integral (MBI), we first identify streamflow tubes, then use the constant of polytropic relation to guarantee that the streamflow tube experiences an unchanged polytropic process, and finally determine the polytropic index of ions in these streamflow tubes. The statistical results show that the magnetosheath is a complicated system in which the polytropic index of ions ranges from -2 to 3. The polytropic index distribution of ions is dependent on the electromagnetic energy flux perpendicular to the streamline. The median polytropic index of ions in the magnetosheath is 0.960, 0.965, and 0.974 for perpendicular electromagnetic energy ratio \u03b4<SUB>E \u00d7 B</SUB> &lt; 5%, \u03b4<SUB>E \u00d7 B</SUB> &lt; 3%, and \u03b4<SUB>E \u00d7 B</SUB> &lt; 1%, respectively. There are two basic polytropic processes in the magnetosheath: the dominant isothermal process and the isobaric process. When there is no exchange of electromagnetic energy between neighboring streamflow tubes, the magnetosheath ions are isothermal. However, when the perpendicular electromagnetic energy ratio increases, the isobaric polytropic process starts to emerge. The magnetosheath ion flows are highly localized because most streamflow tubes experiencing same polytropic processes last less than 60 s. Thus, the polytropic index of magnetosheath ion flows is highly variable.",

The spacecraft's fast transition of the magnetosheath and the steady solar wind conditions during the period analyzed allow both spatial and temporal properties of the shock crossing to be investigated. The observations show that the shock reformation process can be nearly periodic under stable solar wind conditions. Throughout the 25-min-long observation period, the pulsation duration deviated by at most ~10% from the average 10 s period measured. This quasiperiodicity allows us to study all aspects of the shock reconfiguration, including ultra-low-frequency waves in the upstream region and large-amplitude magnetic structures observed in the vicinity of the magnetosheath-solar wind transition region and inside the magnetosheath. We also show that bow shock reformation can be a substantial source of wave activity in the magnetosphere, on this occasion having given rise to oscillations in the magnetic field with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 40-50 nT over large parts of the dayside magnetosphere. The clean and cyclic behavior observed throughout the magnetosphere, the magnetosheath, and the upstream region indicates that the subsolar region was primarily influenced by a cyclic reformation of the shock front, rather than by a spatial and temporal patchwork of short large-amplitude magnetic structures, as is generally the case at the terrestrial bow shock under quasi-parallel conditions.",

         "abstract": "We studied fundamental properties of spatial-temporal evolution of energetic electrons trapped in the inner magnetosphere (L \u2264 7.4) during an isolated substorm by using a four-dimensional drift kinetic simulation under the time-dependent electric and magnetic fields provided by a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. When the interplanetary magnetic field turns southward, both the potential and induction electric fields start to increase in the inner magnetosphere, resulting in a gradual injection of low-energy electrons (\u226451.9 keV) and deceleration of high-energy electrons (\u2265114 keV). The deceleration of high-energy electrons results in a decrease in the phase space density of the high-energy electrons during the growth phase. After a while, an abrupt transition of phase state (a substorm onset) occurs in the magnetosphere, which triggers abrupt changes in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The AL index decreases rapidly, and magnetic field lines become dipole-like. The dipolarization does not proceed smoothly in the inner magnetosphere because of significant force imbalance between the J \u00d7 B force and the grad P force. As a consequence, the electric field oscillates with a period of 2-3 min, resulting in multiple injections of the low-energy electrons. The low- and high-energy electrons are accelerated under the strong influence of the drift betatron and gyro betatron, so that the acceleration process is essentially nonlinear. Our simulation results suggest that the force-induced processes play an essential role in the substorm-associated redistribution of energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere.",

Irrespective of whether this field line resonance is coincidentally or causally linked to this substorm onset, the characteristics of the field line resonance can be used to remote sense the characteristics of the geomagnetic field line that supports substorm onset. In this instance, the eigenfrequency of this resonance is around 12 mHz. Interestingly, however, there is no evidence of this field line resonance in a seven satellite major Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS)-GOES conjunction, ranging from geosynchronous orbit to ~30 R<SUB>E</SUB>. However, using space-based cross-phase measurements of the local field line eigenfrequency at the inner THEMIS locations, we find that the local field line eigenfrequency is 6-10 mHz. Hence, we can reliably say that this 12 mHz Field Line Resonance (FLR) must lie inside of THEMIS locations. Our conclusion is that a high-m field line resonance can both represent a strong candidate for a trigger for substorm onset, as first proposed by Samson et al. (1992), and that its characteristics can provide invaluable information as to where substorm onset occurs in the magnetosphere.",

It is found that, during the substorm growth phase, about 39.4% (76/193) of the selected events display a phenomenon of equatorial plasma pressure (P<SUB>eq</SUB>) decrease. The occurrence rates of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease cases are higher in the dawn (04:00 to 06:00) and dusk (18:00 to 20:00) flanks (&gt; 50%) than in the midnight region (20:00 to 04:00, &lt; 40%). The mean values of the maximum percentages of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease during the substorm growth phases are larger in the dawn and dusk flanks ( -20%) than in the midnight region ( &gt; -16%). The mean value of P<SUB>eq</SUB> increase percentages at the end of substorm growth phase is the highest ( 40%) in the premidnight MLT bin (22:00 to 00:00) and is almost unchanged in the dawn and dusk flanks. Further investigations show that 13.0% of the events have more than 10% of P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease at the end of substorm growth phase comparing to the value before the growth phase, and 28.0% of the events have small changes (&lt; 10%), and 59.0% events have a more than 10% increase. This study also reveals the importance of electron pressure (P<SUB>e</SUB>) in the variation of P<SUB>eq</SUB> in the substorm growth phase. The P<SUB>e</SUB> variations often account for more than 50% of the P<SUB>eq</SUB> changes, and the ratios of P<SUB>e</SUB> to ion pressure often display large variations ( 50%). Among the investigated events, during the growth phase, an enhanced equatorial plasma convection flow is observed, which diverges in the midnight tail region and propagates azimuthally toward the dayside magnetosphere with velocity of 20 km/s. It is proposed that the P<SUB>eq</SUB> decreases in the near-Earth plasma sheet during the substorm growth phase may be due to the transport of closed magnetic flux toward the dayside magnetosphere driven by dayside magnetopause reconnection. Both solar wind and ionospheric conductivity effects may influence the distributions of occurrence rates for P<SUB>eq</SUB> decrease events and the P<SUB>eq</SUB> increase percentages in the investigated region.",

         "abstract": "Energetic ion distributions in the near-Earth plasma sheet can provide important information for understanding the entry of ions into the magnetosphere and their transportation, acceleration, and losses in the near-Earth region. In this study, 11 years of energetic proton and oxygen observations (&gt; 274 keV) from Cluster/Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors were used to statistically study the energetic ion distributions in the near-Earth region. The dawn-dusk asymmetries of the distributions in three different regions (dayside magnetosphere, near-Earth nightside plasma sheet, and tail plasma sheet) are examined in Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The results show that the energetic ion distributions are influenced by the dawn-dusk interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction. The enhancement of ion intensity largely correlates with the location of the magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause. The results imply that substorm-related acceleration processes in the magnetotail are not the only source of energetic ions in the dayside and the near-Earth magnetosphere. Energetic ions delivered through reconnection at the magnetopause significantly affect the energetic ion population in the magnetosphere. We also believe that the influence of the dawn-dusk IMF direction should not be neglected in models of the particle population in the magnetosphere.",

We also model the propagation of these sferics through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide to the subsatellite point using the Long-Wavelength Propagation Capability software and compare this result to the same C/NOFS data set. This unprecedentedly expansive data set allows comparison to theory and prior observation of VLF radio wave propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide and low-latitude ionosphere. We show that WWLLN and C/NOFS observe the well-known effect of variable attenuation with direction within the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Propagation within the ionosphere is also examined, and a lack of attenuation above 400 km is observed. Finally, in comparison to recent works using Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions (DEMETER) data by Fiser et al. and Chum et al., we find that C/NOFS successfully detects whistlers with comparable amplitudes at much greater distances, compared to those reported for DEMETER.",

         "abstract": "This paper presents a study of mesosphere and low thermosphere influence on ionospheric disturbances during 2009 major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. This period was characterized by extremely low solar and geomagnetic activity. The study was performed using two first principal models: thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) and global self-consistent model of thermosphere, ionosphere, and protonosphere (GSM TIP). The stratospheric anomalies during SSW event were modeled by specifying the temperature and density perturbations at the lower boundary of the TIME-GCM (30 km altitude) according to data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Then TIME-GCM output at 80 km was used as lower boundary conditions for driving GSM TIP model runs. We compare models' results with ground-based ionospheric data at low latitudes obtained by GPS receivers in the American longitudinal sector. GSM TIP simulation predicts the occurrence of the quasi-wave vertical structure in neutral temperature disturbances at 80-200 km altitude, and the positive and negative disturbances in total electron content at low latitude during the 2009 SSW event. According to our model results the formation mechanisms of the low-latitude ionospheric response are the disturbances in the n(O)/n(N<SUB>2</SUB>) ratio and thermospheric wind. The change in zonal electric field is key mechanism driving the ionospheric response at low latitudes, but our model results do not completely reproduce the variability in zonal electric fields (vertical plasma drift) at low latitudes.",

The ENA energy used in the present study ranges from 10 to 198 keV for hydrogen and from 29 to 222 keV for oxygen. We use ENA data obtained from two independent areas of a HENA image, for which HENA lines of sight pass through the inner magnetosphere (\u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; X &lt; \u223c-3 R<SUB>E</SUB> around the magnetic equator) and the outer magnetosphere (X &lt; \u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB> around the magnetic equator). The analyses of the selected ENA data yield the following results: (1) The oxygen ENA flux displays 20-30 min bursts during all substorms, while the hydrogen ENA flux did not increase or less significantly increased than the oxygen flux. (2) The temporal evolution of energy spectra is mass dependent for all examined substorms. (3) For two of the substorms, the oxygen flux ratio between before and after a substorm increases with increasing energy, indicating the hardening of an O<SUP>+</SUP> energy spectrum. (4) The flux ratio for the inner image area is comparable to or higher than that in the outer area. The results confirm that nonadiabatic acceleration with regard to the first adiabatic invariant did occur in the near-Earth magnetotail (X &gt; -8 R<SUB>E</SUB>). Although the influence of the nonadiabatic acceleration appears in the inner magnetosphere (\u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; X &lt; \u223c-3 R<SUB>E</SUB>) as well as the outer magnetosphere (\u223c-8 R<SUB>E</SUB> &lt; X &lt; \u223c-6 R<SUB>E</SUB>), it is not clear from the present results whether O<SUP>+</SUP> energization in the inner magnetosphere is due to nonadiabatic acceleration in the inner magnetosphere or adiabatic transport of O<SUP>+</SUP> nonadiabatically accelerated in the outer magnetosphere. It is likely, for at least the two substorms, that the nonadiabatic acceleration makes a more significant contribution to O<SUP>+</SUP> energization than increase of the O<SUP>+</SUP> density in the plasma sheet.",

         "abstract": "In-situ observations of spatial variations of the wave-particle interaction region require a large number of satellite probes. As an alternative, flash-type auroras, a kind of pulsating aurora, driven by discrete chorus elements, can be used to investigate the interaction region with a high spatial resolution. We estimated the spatial extent of wave-particle interaction region from ground-based observations of flash aurora at Gakona (62.39\u00b0N, 214.78\u00b0E), Alaska at subauroral latitudes, and found that the auroral expansion was predominantly to the low-latitude side. The spatial displacement is thought to be caused by the propagation effects of chorus waves in the magnetosphere. Using ray tracing analysis to take into account chorus wave propagation, we reconstructed the spatiotemporal evolution of the volume emission rate and confirmed that the predominant expansion is toward the lower-latitude side in the ionosphere. This study shows that chorus wave propagation in the magnetosphere gives new insight for characterizing the transverse size (across the geomagnetic field line) of wave-particle interaction regions. The calculated spatial scale of the column auroral emission shows a correlation with the magnetic latitude of the resonance region at magnetic latitudes within 10\u00b0 of the equatorial plane of the magnetosphere. Our results suggest that the spatial scale of a flash aurora is indirectly related to the chorus amplitude because the latitudinal range of the wave-particle interaction is important for the growth of wave amplitude.",

It is not yet known how the solar wind oscillation frequency, and thus its temporal variation, regulates the energy flow through the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. Utilizing the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model driven by solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), we have analyzed the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system response to IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillations with periods of 10, 30, and 60 min from the perspective of energy budget. Our results indicate that the energy flow from the solar wind to geospace depends on the IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillation frequency. The energy coupling efficiency, defined as the ratio of the globally integrated joule heating to Akasofu's Epsilon function, is higher for lower frequency IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillations. Joule heating in the upper atmosphere depends not only on directly driven processes due to solar wind variability but also on the intrinsic dynamics of the magnetosphere (i.e., loading-unloading process). This work highlights the critical role of solar wind and IMF temporal variation and the inductive inertia and resistance of coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system in controlling the energy transfer in the coupled solar wind-geospace system, which has not been explored before.",

         "abstract": "The magnetosheath plays a central role in the solar wind-magnetospheric coupling. Yet the effects of its crossing on solar wind structures such as magnetic clouds (MCs) are generally overlooked when assessing their geoeffectivity. Using 82 MCs observed simultaneously in the solar wind and the magnetosheath, we carry out the first statistical study of the alteration of their magnetic structure in the magnetosheath. For each event, the bow shock properties are obtained from a magnetosheath model. The comparison between the model results and observations shows that in 80% of cases, the MHD-based model captures well the magnetosheath transition; the other events are discussed separately. We find that just downstream of the bow shock the variation of the magnetic field direction shows a very good anticorrelation (r =- 0.91) with the angle between the upstream magnetic field and the shock normal. We then focus on the magnetic field north-south component B<SUB>z</SUB> because of its importance for geoeffectivity. Although the sign of B<SUB>z</SUB> is generally preserved in the magnetosheath, we also find evidence of long-lasting intervals of opposite B<SUB>z</SUB> signs in the solar wind and the magnetosheath during some events, with a |B<SUB>z</SUB>| reversal &gt;10 nT at the magnetopause. We find that these reversals are due to the draping of the field lines and are associated with predominant upstream B<SUB>y</SUB>. In those cases, the estimated position of the regions of antiparallel fields along the magnetopause is independent of the sign of the upstream B<SUB>z</SUB>. This may have strong implications in terms of reconnection.",

         "abstract": "Recent studies have utilized different charge states of oxygen ions as a tracer for the origins of plasma populations in the magnetosphere of Earth, using O<SUP>+</SUP> as an indicator of ionospheric-originating plasma and O<SUP>6+</SUP> as an indicator of solar wind-originating plasma. These studies have correlated enhancements in O<SUP>6+</SUP> to various solar wind and geomagnetic conditions to characterize the dominant solar wind injection mechanisms into the magnetosphere but did not include analysis of the temporal evolution of these ions. A sixth-order Fourier expansion model based empirically on a superposed epoch analysis of geomagnetic storms observed by Polar is presented in this study to provide insight into the evolution of both ionospheric-originating and solar wind-originating plasma throughout geomagnetic storms. At high energies ( 200 keV) the flux of O<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUP>6+</SUP> are seen to become comparable in the outer magnetosphere. Moreover, while the density of O<SUP>+</SUP> is far higher than O<SUP>6+</SUP>, the two charge states have comparable pressures in the outer magnetosphere. The temperature of O<SUP>6+</SUP> is generally higher than that of O<SUP>+</SUP>, because the O<SUP>6+</SUP> is injected from preheated magnetosheath populations before undergoing further heating once in the magnetosphere. A comparison between the model results with O<SUP>+</SUP> observations from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and the Van Allen Probes provides a validation of the model. In general, this empirical model agrees qualitatively well with the trends seen in both data sets. Quantitatively, the modeled density, pressure, and temperature almost always agree within a factor of at most 10, 5, and 2, respectively.",

We found that in the mesosphere, dynamics significantly impact temperature and wind trends, as well as how solar irradiance affects the temperature and winds. The global average temperature trends are negative, with a maximum of -1 K per decade in the middle to lower mesosphere. Solar irradiance effects on the global average temperature are positive and decrease monotonically with decreasing altitude, changing from 3 K/100 solar flux units (sfu) near the mesopause to 1 K per 100 sfu in the lower mesosphere. In the summer upper mesosphere, temperature trends can become near 0 or positive, likely due to dynamical effects. Both wind trends and solar effects on the winds show dynamical patterns with negative and positive values, indicating that they are predominantly controlled by dynamics. The wind trends and solar effects on the winds are on the orders of \u00b15 m/s per decade and \u00b15 m/s per 100 sfu, respectively, and they are not as statistically significant as their temperature counterparts. At Collm (51\u00b0N, 13\u00b0E), the observed zonal winds at 90 km have a larger trend of 1.98 m/s per decade compared to the simulated zonal winds and it is statistically significant, but both the simulated and observed meridional winds do not have statistically significant trends.",

The fast rotation of Jupiter and the outward transport of ionized gasses are responsible for forming a huge and rotationally dominant magnetosphere. The plasma supply from the satellite has a key role in the characterization of the Jovian magnetosphere. In fact, significant variations of the plasma population in the inner magnetosphere caused by the volcanic eruptions in Io were found in early 2015, using a continuous data set of the Io plasma torus obtained from an extreme ultraviolet spectroscope onboard the Hisaki satellite. The time evolution of the Io plasma torus radial distribution showed that the outward transport of plasma through 8 R<SUB>J</SUB> from Jupiter was enhanced for approximately 2 months (from the end of January to the beginning of April 2015). Intense short-lived auroral brightenings-which represent transient energy releases in the outer part of the magnetosphere\u2014occurred frequently during this period. The short-lived auroral brightenings accompanied well-defined sporadic enhancements of the ion brightness in the plasma torus, indicating a rapid inward transport of energy from the outer part of the magnetosphere and the resultant enhancement of hot electron population in the inner magnetosphere. This evidently shows that the change in a plasma source in the inner magnetosphere affects a large-scale radial circulation of mass and energy in a rotationally dominant magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Plasma dynamics in the inner magnetosphere are greatly affected by variations in the ion composition. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen has been shown to be highly dependent on geomagnetic activity. To investigate this dependence, we examine the timing of the injection and subsequent evolution of O<SUP>+</SUP> in the ring current during the storm of 6 August 2011 as observed by Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers (TWINS) instruments. To help interpret magnetospheric evolution using the global O Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) emission measured by TWINS, we have employed a multidomain modeling of the global magnetosphere using the Space Weather Modeling Framework. TWINS Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) imagers have the capability to distinguish between H and O emission and thus the major ion constituents of the ring current. Global composition measurements from TWINS spacecraft show intensifications of the oxygen ENA emission and thus an increase in the transport of ionospheric oxygen into the ring current that occur during the main phase of the storm. Both the observations and the simulation suggests that the peak in O ENA emission is correlated with the substorm injections that occurred during this time. The model also shows a very dynamic magnetosphere that allows for loss of oxygen from the Earth-magnetosphere system through plasmoids capable of transporting oxygen down the tail throughout the magnetic storm. This can possibly be a predominant pathway for loss of oxygen from the magnetosphere.",

At ~0831 UT, an earthward flow at THC, at X ~ 18 Re, was observed which was likely to be associated with an auroral streamer observed at the ASI station FSMI. Near-Earth satellites THD and THE, separated in the Y-direction by ~1 Re, and magnetically mapping onto the preexisting aurora arc, also observed the earthward flow but with a small Alfv\u00e9n transit time of ~20 s between the magnetotail and the ionosphere. As the earthward flow arrived at THD and THE, the aurora arc near the footprints of THD and THE brightened. A duskward pressure gradient developed between THD and THE in the equatorial magnetotail, corresponding to an upward FAC and consistent with the auroral brightening. At ~0834 UT, an eastward diversion of the flow was observed first at THE and later at THD, further to the East. At the head of that flow, pressure variations, coherent between THE and THD, were observed to propagate Eastward at ~400 km/s, consistent with an eastward auroral expansion near the footprints of THE and THD. Concurrent perturbations of the B<SUB>y</SUB> component of the magnetic field signify eastward motion of a FAC pair at the two spacecraft locations. We interpret the pressure variations as the generator of the observed FAC that feeds the arc and its eastward expansion.",

Saturn's magnetosphere is stabilized by a radially increasing profile of flux tube entropy and destabilized by a radially decreasing profile of flux tube content. The traditional radial transport scenario suggested that the magnetic flux with heavy flux tube content moves from the inner magnetosphere to the outer magnetosphere, stretching the magnetic field into a magnetodisc configuration. Subsequently, magnetic flux with low flux tube entropy generated by magnetodisc reconnection circulates back to the inner magnetosphere. However, the low-specific entropy plasma with a narrow distribution in Saturn's inner magnetosphere suggests a significant nonadiabatic cooling process during the inward motion. The flux tube entropy analysis suggests that energetic particles dominate the total flux tube entropy in the magnetodisc region, and newly closed field lines generated by magnetodisc reconnection are likely to be transported into the inner magnetosphere. Based on the flux tube entropy constraint, this study demonstrates that the radial transport process in Saturn's magnetosphere can also be achieved via middle-latitude double reconnection, driven by a low-latitude interchange instability. This process does not involve significant latitudinal convection of magnetic flux in the ionosphere nor does it significantly modify the radial flux tube entropy profile.",

From the cross-examination of the estimates of various ionospheric and magnetospheric processes, it is inferred that (1) Poynting flux from the tail lobes to the plasma sheet accounts for the ionospheric energy dissipation during the substorm expansion phase, suggesting that the lobe reconnection is the primary driver of the substorm energy transport to the ionosphere; (2) the area around the duskside poleward boundary of the auroral bulge, where auroral emission is intense throughout the expansion phase, accounts for &gt;10%, likely a few tens of percent, of the ionospheric substorm energy dissipation, suggesting that the area is a crucial energy sink; and (3) kinetic energy carried by the bursty bulk flows is comparable to the energy deposited in association with the auroral streamers, and each bursty bulk flow accounts for 1% of the total substorm energy deposition, which may sum up to 10% throughout the expansion phase. Points 2 and 3 imply that energy deposited to the ionosphere is transported mostly along, rather than across, the magnetic field lines in the plasma sheet. The responsible field-aligned plasma flows may be generated as the perpendicular plasma motion creates field-aligned pressure gradient in the presence of field line curvature. Energy flux associated with enhanced convection in the plasma sheet is statistically examined with the Geotail data set, which confirms that more energy is carried earthward by the field-aligned flows than by the convection flows.",

The Fourier fitting method was applied to obtain the monthly mean amplitudes of zonal wind, TEC and EEJ. The least squares fitting method was utilized to perform a spectral analysis. Our data indicate that the QBOs of the stratosphere and mesosphere are present in the zonal winds between 20 and 40 km and 82 and 96 km at KB. The QBO is also present in the global TEC at 40\u00b0S to 40\u00b0N latitude and is characterized by the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). We propose that the QBOs in the mesosphere are linked to the QBOs in the ionosphere through the modulation of the E region dynamo by neutral winds and the equatorial ionospheric fountain effect. This model is verified by the QBO signals in the EEJ and diurnal tides in the E region of the ionosphere. The absence of QBO signals in the zonal wind at 250 km confirms that QBO signals in the TEC are not modulated by the zonal wind in the F region ionosphere, which further substantiates the model.",

We attribute the dominant driver of this variability to a combination of tides generated in situ and in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. We identify nonmigrating tidal signatures attributable to the latter source that are ubiquitous, persistent, and significant at all thermospheric latitudes. Further, these perturbations underlie the upper atmospheric response to solar geomagnetic disturbances and are measurably altered, along with their migrating counterparts, during the storm. Our investigation is centered on a series of National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model simulations during 1-10 April 2010, including an optimal simulation with lower boundary forcing based on Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application reanalysis data and upper boundary forcing based on satellite and ground magnetometer measurements and the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics procedure and three diagnostic simulations. The differences between the optimal and diagnostic simulations allow us to quantify thermospheric variability attributable to solar geomagnetic forcing and dynamical effects propagating into the thermosphere from below. We find that they can be comparable at high latitudes for some nonmigrating tidal components.",

         "abstract": "Obtaining accurate predictions of the neutral density in the thermosphere has been a long-standing problem. During geomagnetic storms the auroral heating in the polar ionospheres quickly raises the temperature of the thermosphere, resulting in higher neutral densities that exert a greater drag force on objects in low Earth orbit. Rapid increases and decreases in the temperature and density may occur within a couple days. A key parameter in the thermosphere is the total amount of nitric oxide (NO). The production of NO is accelerated by the auroral heating, and since NO is an efficient radiator of thermal energy, higher concentrations of this molecule accelerate the rate at which the thermosphere cools. This paper describes an improved technique that calculates changes in the global temperature of the thermosphere. Starting from an empirical model of the Poynting flux into the ionosphere, a set of differential equations derives the minimum, global value of the exospheric temperature, which can be used in a neutral density model to calculate the global values. The relative variations in NO content are used to obtain more accurate cooling rates. Comparisons with the global rate of NO emissions that are measured with the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument show that there is very good agreement with the predicted values. The NO emissions correlate highly with the total auroral heating that has been integrated over time. We also show that the NO emissions are highly correlated with thermospheric temperature, as well as indices of solar extreme ultraviolet radiation.",

Interaction of an interplanetary fast forward shock with the magnetopause caused a shock-related disturbance inside the magnetosphere that propagated at a speed significantly higher than that in the solar wind or magnetosheath. The propagation direction of the disturbance was calculated from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, velocity and magnetic coplanarity, and minimum variance analysis and is shown to vary in different regions of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, the impulse disturbance wave mode changes as the plasma and field conditions change inside the magnetosphere. These results bring important new information about the propagation processes that is not directly obtainable from point measurements made by (even several) spacecraft. On the other hand, comparison of ionospheric observations from the IMAGE magnetometer chain with geosynchronous data allow us to also interpret the double step structure observed at dayside geosynchronous orbit, which is below the simulation resolution. This combination provides us with quite a complete view on shock propagation inside the magnetosphere.",

During its period of greatest intensity, in the central Caribbean, Matthew excited a large number of concentric gravity waves (GWs or CGWs). In this paper, we report on hurricane-generated CGWs observed in both the stratosphere and mesosphere from spaceborne satellites and in the ionosphere by ground Global Positioning System receivers. We found CGWs with horizontal wavelengths of 200-300 km in the stratosphere (height of 30-40 km) and in the airglow layer of the mesopause (height of 85-90 km), and we found concentric traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs or CTIDs) with horizontal wavelengths of 250-350 km in the ionosphere (height of 100-400 km). The observed TIDs lasted for more than several hours on 1, 2, and 7 October 2016. We also briefly discuss the vertical and horizontal propagation of the Hurricane Matthew-induced GWs and TIDs. This study shows that Hurricane Matthew induced significant dynamical coupling between the troposphere and the entire middle and upper atmosphere via GWs. It is the first comprehensive satellite analysis of gravity wave propagation generated by hurricane event from the troposphere through the stratosphere and mesosphere into the ionosphere.",

In this study, we investigate the response of the upper thermospheric winds to four substorm events by using the Fabry-Perot interferometer at Troms\u00f8, Norway, the International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects magnetometers, the EISCAT radar, and an all-sky camera. The upper thermospheric winds had distinct responses to substorm phases. During the growth phase, westward acceleration of the wind was observed in the premidnight sector within the eastward electrojet region. We suggest that the westward acceleration of the neutral wind is caused by the ion drag force associated with the large-scale westward plasma convection within the eastward electrojet. During the expansion phase, the zonal wind had a prompt response to the intensification of the westward electrojet (WEJ) overhead Troms\u00f8. The zonal wind was accelerated eastward, which is likely to be associated with the eastward plasma convection within the substorm current wedge. During the expansion and recovery phases, the meridional wind was frequently accelerated to the southward direction, when the majority of the substorm WEJ current was located on the poleward side of Troms\u00f8. We suggest that this meridional wind acceleration is related to a pressure gradient produced by Joule heating within the substorm WEJ region. In addition, strong atmospheric gravity waves during the expansion and the recovery phases were observed.",

         "abstract": "Pi2 pulsations observed in the inner magnetosphere have been explained as radially trapped fast mode waves in the plasmasphere (i.e., plasmaspheric resonance). This model suggests that these waves can be globally detected at all local times in the inner magnetosphere when azimuthal propagation is allowed. There are no reports of Pi2-associated fast mode waves on the dayside in the inner magnetosphere, however. In this case study we focus on a Pi2 pulsation that was observed by the low-latitude Bohyun station (L = 1.35) in the postmidnight sector (MLT = 3.1) at 1853 UT on 27 February 2008. During the Pi2 event, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS)-E was near the dawnside inner magnetosphere (MLT = 5.1 and L = 2.6), and THEMIS-D was near the duskside inner magnetosphere (MLT = 17.8 and L = 3.1), which are transition regions between nightside and dayside. On the dawnside, THEMIS-E observed poloidal oscillations characterized by the azimuthal component of the electric field (\u03b4E<SUB>y</SUB>) and the radial (\u03b4B<SUB>x</SUB>) and compressional (\u03b4B<SUB>z</SUB>) components of the magnetic field. These components had high coherence (&gt;0.8) with a low-latitude Pi2 pulsation at Bohyun. We confirmed that the poloidal oscillations are radially standing fast mode waves excited by plasmaspheric resonance. On the duskside, however, no poloidal oscillations in the Pi2 frequency band were detected at THEMIS-D, indicating that the plasmaspheric resonance may not establish itself globally. We suggest that there is strong longitudinal attenuation of fast mode waves near the duskside, which may be due to complicated duskside plasmapause structures. In addition, a well-defined, trapped fast mode oscillation would be expected as a two-dimensional mode structure near the meridian plane of a source region.",

We consider the possibility that these ions originate from the magnetosphere. The ion composition ratios, flux levels, and the spectral slopes of the energetic ion energy spectra observed in the foreshock and in the magnetosheath resemble those in the outer magnetosphere but differ significantly from those seen further upstream from the bow shock at ACE. The particle gyrocenters lie earthward from the spacecraft, indicating that the maximum ion fluxes come from close to the magnetosphere. We provide important evidence that argues against an explanation of the particle source in terms of hot flow anomaly acceleration. A three-dimensional global hybrid simulation shows that escaping magnetospheric ions can be scattered and transported across the magnetosheath. Ground magnetometer observations suggest that a solar wind pressure increase accelerates escaping magnetospheric ions via betatron acceleration, resulting in an inverse energy dispersion in the magnetosheath. However, there are no pressure changes detected on the MMS and ACE spacecraft and the ground magnetic field strength does not appear to be large enough to be consistent with the large magnetospheric compression needed to account for a betatron acceleration. Therefore, we suggest that the inverse energy dispersion event can be explained by a magnetic field rotation that connects MMS to the subsolar magnetosphere, enabling high-energy particles from deep within the inner magnetosphere gain access to the magnetopause and magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "GPS-based ionospheric tomography is a well-known technique for imaging the total electron content (TEC) between GPS satellites and receivers. However, as an integral measurement of electron concentration, TEC typically encompasses both the ionosphere and plasmasphere, masking signatures from the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere due to the dominant ionosphere. Imaging these regions requires a technique that isolates TEC in the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere. Multi-Instrument Data Analysis System (MIDAS) employs tomography to image the electron distribution in the ionosphere. Its implementation for regions beyond is yet to be seen due to the different dynamics present above the ionosphere. This paper discusses the extension of MIDAS to image these altitudes using GPS phase-based TEC measurements and follows the work by Spencer and Mitchell (2011). Plasma is constrained to dipole field lines described by Euler potentials, resulting in a distribution symmetrical about the geomagnetic equator. A simulation of an empirical plasmaspheric model by Gallagher et al. (1988) is used to verify the technique by comparing reconstructions of the simulation with the empirical model. The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) is used as GPS receiver locations. The verification is followed by a validation of the modified MIDAS algorithm, where the regions' TEC is reconstructed from COSMIC GPS phase measurements and qualitatively compared with previous studies using Jason-1 and COSMIC data. Results show that MIDAS can successfully image features/trends of the topside ionosphere-plasmasphere observed in other studies, with deviations in absolute TEC attributed to differences in data set properties and the resolution of the images.",

         "abstract": "Medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) are a phenomenon widely and frequently observed over the ionosphere from high to low latitudes. Night time MSTIDs are caused generally by the polarization electric field in the ionosphere. However, propagation of this polarization electric field to the magnetosphere has not yet been identified. Here, we report the first observation of the polarization electric field and associated density variations of a night time MSTID in the magnetosphere. The MSTID event was observed by an all-sky airglow imager at Gakona (geographical latitude: 62.39\u00b0N, geographical longitude: 214.78\u00b0E, magnetic latitude: 63.20\u00b0N), Alaska. The Arase satellite passed over the MSTID in the inner magnetosphere at 0530-0800 UT (2030-2300 LT) on November 3, 2018. This MSTID, observed in 630 nm airglow images, was propagating westward with a horizontal wavelength of \u223c165 km, a north-south phase front, and a phase velocity of \u223c80 m/s. The Arase satellite footprint on the ionosphere crossed the MSTID in the direction nearly perpendicular to the MSTID phase fronts. The electric field and electron density observed by the Arase satellite showed periodic variation associated with the MSTID structure with amplitudes of \u223c2 mV/m and \u223c150 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively. The electric field variations projected to the ionosphere are mainly in the east-west direction and are consistent with the direction of the polarization electric field expected from MSTID growth by E \u00d7 B drift. This observation indicates that the polarization electric field associated with the MSTID in the ionosphere is projected onto the magnetosphere, causing plasma density fluctuations in the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "We study the role of substorms and steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) in magnetic flux transport in the magnetosphere, using observations of field-aligned currents by the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment. We identify two classes of substorm, with onsets above and below 65\u00b0 magnetic latitude, which display different nightside field-aligned current morphologies. We show that the low-latitude onsets develop a poleward-expanding auroral bulge, and identify these as substorms that manifest ionospheric convection-braking in the auroral bulge region as suggested by Grocott et al. (2009, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-27-591-2009\">https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-27-591-2009</A>). We show that the high-latitude substorms, which do not experience braking, can evolve into SMC events if the interplanetary magnetic field remains southward for a prolonged period following onset. We conclude that during periods of ongoing driving, the magnetosphere displays repeated substorm activity or SMC depending on the rate of driving and the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere prior to onset. We speculate that sawtooth events are an extreme case of repeated onsets and that substorms triggered by northward-turnings of the interplanetary magnetic field mark the cessation of periods of SMC. Our results provide a new explanation for the differing modes of response of the terrestrial system to solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling by invoking friction between the ionosphere and atmosphere.",

         "abstract": "The formation of plasmoids in the near-Earth magnetotail is believed to be a key element of the substorm onset process. Previous work has identified a new scenario in MHD simulations where the nonlinear evolution of a ballooning instability is able to induce the formation of plasmoids in a generalized Harris sheet with finite normal magnetic component. In present work, we further examine this novel mechanism for plasmoid formation and explore its implications in the context of substorm onset trigger problem. For that purpose, we adopt the generalized Harris sheet as a model proxy to the near-Earth region of magnetotail during the substorm growth phase. In this region the magnetic component normal to the neutral sheet B<SUB>n</SUB> is weak but nonzero. The magnetic field lines are closed, and there are no Xlines. Simulation results indicate that in the higher Lundquist number regime S\u2273104, the linear axial tail mode, which is also known as \"two-dimensional resistive tearing mode,\" is stabilized by the finite B<SUB>n</SUB>, hence cannot give rise to the formation of X lines or plasmoids by itself. On the other hand, the linear ballooning mode is unstable in the same region and regime, and its nonlinear development leads to the formation of a series of plasmoid structures in the near-Earth and middle magnetotail regions of plasma sheet. This new scenario of plasmoid formation suggests a critical role of ballooning instability in the near-Earth plasma sheet in triggering the onset of a substorm expansion.",

         "abstract": "The development of global magnetospheric models, such as Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), which can accurately reproduce and track space weather processes has high practical utility. We present an interval on 5 June 1998, where the location of the polar cap boundary, or open-closed field line boundary (OCB), can be determined in the ionosphere using a combination of instruments during a period encompassing a sharp northward to southward interplanetary field turning. We present both point- and time-varying comparisons of the observed and simulated boundaries in the ionosphere and find that when using solely the coupled ideal magnetohydrodynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere model, the rate of change of the OCB to a southward turning of the interplanetary field is significantly faster than that computed from the observational data. However, when the inner magnetospheric module is incorporated, the modeling framework both qualitatively, and often quantitatively, reproduces many elements of the studied interval prior to an observed substorm onset. This result demonstrates that the physics of the inner magnetosphere is critical in shaping the boundary between open and closed field lines during periods of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and provides significant insight into the 3-D time-dependent behavior of the Earth's magnetosphere in response to a northward-southward IMF turning. We assert that during periods that do not include the tens of minutes surrounding substorm expansion phase onset, the coupled SWMF model may provide a valuable and reliable tool for estimating both the OCB and magnetic field topology over a wide range of latitudes and local times.",

         "abstract": "Due to Venus not having a substantial planetary magnetic field the fast-flowing solar wind plasma can propagate to regions close to the planet. Therefore, thermal atomic oxygen in the thermosphere, hot oxygen in the corona, and the resulting pickup oxygen ions are essential for determining the overall interaction of the planet with plasma of the ambient solar wind. To investigate this complex system, we have initiated a project where a combination of Venus Thermosphere General Circulation Model (VTGCM) and Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS) codes are used to determine the variability of the \"hot\" O corona depending on the solar conditions. Here we present the results of modeling Venus' oxygen corona using the VTGCM ionosphere/thermosphere and AMPS kinetic particle models. VTGCM produces a self-consistent calculation of the thermosphere/ionosphere, providing the spatial distributions of the dominant species. That is further used in AMPS' modeling of Venus' exosphere (a) to specify the source of the newly created hot O atoms produced by dissociative recombination of O<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> ions and (b) to account for thermalization of these energetic oxygen atoms as they propagate in the upper thermosphere. The altitude distribution of hot O calculated for the solar maximum conditions agree well with Pioneer Venus Orbiter observations of the oxygen corona. The modeling that we have performed for the solar minimum conditions indicates a decrease of the oxygen density in the corona by almost a factor of six compared to that at solar maximum. That is consistent with the non-detection of the oxygen corona from Venus Express. As expected, the solar moderate case is between the solar maximum and minimum cases.",

The goal of this study is to understand physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of active discrete auroral forms (curls and folds) typically observed during the substorm onset. Our simulations demonstrate that active feedback of the auroral ionosphere on magnetic field-aligned currents carried by ULF Alfv\u00e9n waves can explain wide variety of auroral structures. The main reason for this variety is a susceptibility of the electrodynamics of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system to parameters of the electric field and plasma in the ionosphere and magnetosphere of the Earth. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, different combinations of these parameters lead to different spatial and temporal behavior of the magnetic field-aligned currents producing aurora. One of the main conclusions from our study is that the ionosphere is responsible for the formation of small-scale curls and folds in the discrete aurora and for the intensification of magnetic field-aligned currents, observed during substorms. The results from our 3-D simulations are applied for the explanation of structure of discrete auroral arcs observed during the 29 October 2013 substorm at Fort Yukon, Alaska.",

         "abstract": "The seasonal variability of the ionospheric lunar tide is investigated using a combination of Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations and thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) simulations. The present study focuses on the seasonal variability of the lunar tide in the ionosphere and its potential connection to the occurrence of stratosphere sudden warmings (SSWs). COSMIC maximum F region electron density (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) and total electron content observations reveal a primarily annual variation of the ionospheric lunar tide, with maximum amplitudes occurring at low latitudes during December-February. Simulations of the lunar tide climatology in TIME-GCM display a similar annual variability as the COSMIC observations. This leads to the conclusion that the annual variability of the lunar tide in the ionosphere is not solely due to the occurrence of SSWs. Rather, the annual variability of the lunar tide in the ionosphere is generated by the seasonal variability of the lunar tide at E region altitudes. However, compared to the observations, the ionospheric lunar tide annual variability is weaker in the climatological simulations which is attributed to the occurrence of SSWs during the majority of the years included in the observations. Introducing a SSW into the TIME-GCM simulation leads to an additional enhancement of the lunar tide during Northern Hemisphere winter, increasing the lunar tide annual variability and resulting in an annual variability that is more consistent with the observations. The occurrence of SSWs can therefore potentially bias lunar tide climatologies, and it is important to consider these effects in studies of the lunar tide in the atmosphere and ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "From multipoint, in situ observations and imaging, we reveal the injection-powered, Alfv\u00e9nic nature of auroral acceleration during onset and expansion of a substorm. It is shown how Alfv\u00e9nic variations over time dissipate to form large-scale, inverted-V structures characteristic of quasistatic aurora. This characterization is made possible through the fortuitous occurrence of a substorm onset and expansion phase on field lines traversed by Cluster in the high-altitude acceleration region. Substorm onset was preceded by the occurrence of multiple poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) and subsequent development/progression of a streamer toward the growth phase arc indicating that this is of the PBI-/streamer-triggered class of substorms. Onset on Cluster is marked by the injection of hot, dense magnetospheric plasma in a region tied to one of the preexisting PBI current systems. This was accompanied by a surge of Alfv\u00e9nic activity and enhanced inverted-V acceleration, as the PBI current system intensified and striated to dispersive scale Alfv\u00e9n waves. The growth of Alfv\u00e9n wave activity was significant (up to a factor of 300 increase in magnetic field power spectral density at frequencies 20 mHz \u2272f\u2272 few hertz) and coincided with moderate growth (factor 3-5) in the background PBI current. This sequence is indicative of a cascade process whereby small-scale/dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves are generated from large-scale Alfv\u00e9n waves or current destabilization. It also demonstrates that the initial PBIs and their subsequent evolution are an intrinsic part of the global auroral substorm response to injection and accompanying wave energy input from the magnetotail. Alfv\u00e9nic activity persisted poleward of the PBI currents composing a broad Alfv\u00e9n wave-dominated region extending to the polar cap edge. These waves have transverse scales ranging from a few tens of kilometers to below the ion gyroradius and are associated with large electric fields (up to 200 mV/m) and Poynting fluxes (up to 200 mW/m<SUP>2</SUP> mapped at ionospheric altitudes). The fluctuations show mixtures of traveling and/or reflected (including standing) wave signatures, depending on frequency and location. A transition from incoming traveling wave to standing wave signatures is also seen near onset. Depending on location, electron distributions show signatures of Alfv\u00e9n acceleration, inverted-V acceleration, or evidence of both. Poleward expansion of substorm emissions coincided with the poleward expansion of the hot energetic plasma, and the formation of a large-scale inverted-V current system with concurrent attenuation of Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations within the Alfv\u00e9n-dominated region. We suggest that the attenuation is due to a dissipative effect owing to changes in the dispersive properties of these waves via the injection process and/or due to a transient magnetotail source. These findings suggest that in addition to playing active roles in driving substorm aurora, inverted-V and Alfv\u00e9nic acceleration processes are causally linked.",

Gravity wave (GW) breaking events in the upper mesosphere at altitudes (z) of 80 to 100 km were observed in the 557.7 nm emission on the evening of 4 March 2009 from 08:40 to 13:50 UT. During this time, unusual oppositely propagating weak northwestward (NW-ward) and strong southeastward (SE-ward) GWs were observed in the all-sky images of the thermospheric atomic oxygen O(<SUP>1</SUP>D) 630.0 nm emission at 250 km altitude. The waves appeared to originate from the same location over New Zealand, with phase fronts nearly parallel to the landmass axis of the South Island of New Zealand. Additionally, the southern portion of the wave train ends abruptly at the southern tip of New Zealand. The SE-ward GWs were stronger and appeared for ~5 h, while the NW-ward GWs were weaker and only appeared for ~1.75 h. We provide evidence that mountain waves were likely generated in the troposphere that evening. Momentum deposition from GW breaking excites secondary GWs. We model these secondary GWs and show that these GWs have a similar morphology and behavior as observed. Wind filtering in the thermosphere can account for the larger amplitudes and persistent appearance of the SE-ward GWs and the smaller amplitudes and less persistent appearance of the NW-ward GWs. Thus, the morphology and behavior of the 630.0 nm GWs suggest that they were secondary GWs generated from mountain wave breaking in the upper mesosphere. We also show that similar SE-ward GWs have occurred in the 630.0 nm emission on other occasions.",

In this study, we focus on the response of the Jovian thermosphere to variations in the solar EUV flux and discuss the consequences for the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system. We use a model that simulates both the thermospheric dynamics and the magnetospheric plasma velocity distribution under conditions of angular momentum transport between these regions. The simulations show that when the EUV flux increases by ~100% and 200%, the thermospheric neutral wind velocity at ~45\u00b0 latitude increases by 16% and 22%, respectively. The short-term variation over a few Earth days causes an increased velocity at middle latitudes which are magnetically conjugate to the Jovian radiation belt. Increased heating due to solar EUV contributes to this velocity change. The other contribution arises ~30 planetary rotations after the initial solar EUV flux increase. This second (\"delayed\") effect is due to propagation of momentum from high latitudes (the auroral region), where Joule heating is dominant, and is related to the behavior of the ionospheric conductance and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents. The modeled velocity enhancement is smaller than that required to explain the observed enhancement of the synchrotron emission by radial diffusion of the trapped energetic electrons. In this context, we discuss the sensitivity of the underlying thermosphere-ionosphere response to short-wavelength solar radiation and the ensuing three-dimensional wind fields.",

         "abstract": "We report both decreasing and increasing trends in the patch sizes during pulsating aurora events. About 150 pulsating auroral events over the Fennoscandian Lapland have been successfully analyzed for their average patch size, total patch area, and number of patches as a function of event time, typically 1-2 hr. An automatic routine has been developed to detect patches in the all-sky camera images. In addition to events with decreasing and increasing average patch size evolution over the course of the pulsating aurora, events with no size trends and events with intermittently increasing and decreasing patch size trends were also found. In this study, we have analyzed a subset of events for which the average and total patch size systematically increase or decrease. The events with increasing patch size trend do not experience a decrease in the peak emission height, which was previously associated with the behavior of pulsating aurora precipitation. Furthermore, the events with increasing patch sizes have shorter lifetimes and twice as many substorm-injected energetic electrons at geosynchronous orbit as the events with decreasing patch sizes. Half of the events with increasing patch sizes occur during substorm expansion phases, while a majority (64%) of the ones with decreasing patch sizes take place during the recovery phase. These findings suggest that the visual appearance of pulsating aurora may be used as an indication of the pulsating aurora energy deposition to the atmosphere.",

         "abstract": "This study investigates the role of solar EUV intensity at controlling the location of the Mars magnetotail current sheet and the structure of the lobes. Four simulation results are examined from a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model. The solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions are held constant, and the Mars crustal field sources are omitted from the simulation configuration. This isolates the influence of solar EUV. It is found that solar maximum conditions, regardless of season, result in a Venus-like tail configuration with the current sheet shifted to the -Y (dawnside) direction. Solar minimum conditions result in a flipped tail configuration with the current sheet shifted to the +Y (duskside) direction. The lobes follow this pattern, with the current sheet shifting away from the larger lobe with the higher magnetic field magnitude. The physical process responsible for this solar EUV control of the magnetotail is the magnetization of the dayside ionosphere. During solar maximum, the ionosphere is relatively strong and the draped IMF field lines quickly slip past Mars. At solar minimum, the weaker ionosphere allows the draped IMF to move closer to the planet. These lower altitudes of the closest approach of the field line to Mars greatly hinder the day-to-night flow of magnetic flux. This results in a buildup of magnetic flux in the dawnside lobe as the S-shaped topology on that side of the magnetosheath extends farther downtail. The study demonstrates that the Mars dayside ionosphere exerts significant control over the nightside induced magnetosphere of that planet.&lt;abstract type=\"synopsis\"&gt;&lt;title type=\"main\"&gt;Plain Language SummaryMars, which does not have a strong magnetic field, has an induced magnetic environment from the draping of the interplanetary magnetic field from the Sun. It folds around Mars, forming two \"lobes\" of magnetic field behind the planet with a current sheet of electrified gas (plasma) behind it. The current sheet is not directly behind the planet but rather shifted toward the dawn or dusk direction. It is shown here that one factor controlling the location of the current sheet is the dayside ionosphere. At solar maximum, the ionosphere is dense, the magnetic field slips easily by the planet, and the current sheet is shifted toward dawn. At solar minimum, the ionosphere is relatively weak, the magnetic field slippage is slowed down, and the current sheet shifts toward dusk.",

         "abstract": "Plasmaspheric virtual resonance (PVR) model has been proposed as one of source mechanisms for low-latitude Pi2 pulsations. Since PVR-associated Pi2 pulsations are not localized inside the plasmasphere, simultaneous multipoint observations inside and outside the plasmasphere require to test the PVR model. Until now, however, there are few studies using simultaneous multisatellite observations inside and outside the plasmasphere for understanding the radial structure of Pi2 pulsation. In this study, we focus on the Pi2 event observed at low-latitude Bohyun (BOH, L = 1.35) ground station in South Korea in the postmidnight sector (magnetic local time (MLT) = 3.0) for the interval from 1730 to 1900 UT on 12 March 2013. By using electron density derived from the frequency of the upper hybrid waves detected at Van Allen Probe-A (VAP-A) and Van Allen Probe-B (VAP-B), the plasmapause is identified. At the time of the Pi2 event, VAP-A was outside the plasmasphere near midnight (00:55 MLT and L =\u223c 6), while VAP-B was inside the plasmasphere in the postmidnight sector (02:15 MLT and L =\u223c 5). VAP-B observed oscillations in the compressional magnetic field component (B<SUB>z</SUB>) and the dawn-to-dusk electric field component (E<SUB>y</SUB>), having high coherence with the BOH Pi2 pulsation in the H component. The H-B<SUB>z</SUB> and H-E<SUB>y</SUB> cross phases at VAP-B inside the plasmasphere were near -180\u00b0 and -90\u00b0, respectively. These phase relationships among B<SUB>z</SUB>, E<SUB>y</SUB>, and H are consistent with a radially standing oscillation of the fundamental mode reported in previous studies. At VAP-A outside the plasmasphere, B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillations were highly correlated with BOH Pi2 pulsations with \u223c-180\u00b0 phase delay, and the H-E<SUB>y</SUB> cross phase is near -90\u00b0. From these two-satellite observations, we suggest that the fundamental PVR mode is directly detected by VAP-A and VAP-B.",

         "abstract": "In this paper, we present comprehensive ground-based and space-based in situ geosynchronous observations of a substorm expansion phase onset on 1 October 2005. The Double Star TC-2 and GOES-12 spacecraft were both located within the substorm current wedge during the substorm expansion phase onset, which occurred over the Canadian sector. We find that an onset of ULF waves in space was observed after onset on the ground by extending the AWESOME timing algorithm into space. Furthermore, a population of low-energy field-aligned electrons was detected by the TC-2 PEACE instrument contemporaneous with the ULF waves in space. These electrons appear to be associated with an enhancement of field-aligned Poynting flux into the ionosphere which is large enough to power visible auroral displays. The observations are most consistent with a near-Earth initiation of substorm expansion phase onset, such as the Near-Geosynchronous Onset (NGO) substorm scenario. A lack of data from further downtail, however, means other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.",

         "abstract": "Two-dimensional thermospheric wind fields, at both E and F region altitudes within a common vertical volume, were made using a Scanning Doppler Imager (SDI) at Poker Flat, Alaska, during a substorm event. Coinciding with these observations were F region plasma velocity measurements from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and estimations of the total downward and upward field-aligned current density from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE). This combination of instruments gives an excellent opportunity to examine the spatial characteristics of high-latitude ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and how a process which is triggered in the magnetosphere (the substorm) affects that coupling at different altitudes. We find that during the substorm growth phase, the F region thermospheric winds respond readily to an expanding ionospheric plasma convection pattern, while the E region winds appear to take a much longer period of time. The differing response timescales of the E and F region winds are likely due to differences in neutral density at those altitudes, resulting in E region neutrals being much more \"sluggish\" with regard to ion drag. We also observe increases in the F region neutral temperature, associated with neutral winds accelerating during both substorm growth and recovery phases.",

         "abstract": "The solar wind is coupled to the magnetosphere-ionosphere system through various interactions, e.g., magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause, and viscous interactions at the low latitude boundary layer. The polar cap, a region of open magnetic flux connecting the magnetic field of the Earth to that of the solar wind, is an ideal region in which to investigate how solar wind drives the magnetosphere-ionosphere dynamo. For such studies, the polar cap (PC) index provides a useful characterization of the state of the polar ionosphere. A previous study by Gao et al. (2012a) found that polar cap dynamics, characterized by the PC index, responds to both solar wind driving quantified by the electric field (E<SUB>K-R</SUB>) proposed by Kivelson and Ridley (2008) which is a representative of the electric field imposed on the ionosphere by magnetopause reconnection that takes cross polar cap potential saturation into account, and the energy release in the magnetotail, described by a modified AL index (AL<SUB>U</SUB>). In that study, the dependence of the PC index on E<SUB>K-R</SUB> and AL<SUB>U</SUB> was investigated assuming a linear relationship. In this study, we test the assumption that the relationship is linear by performing a similar analysis applying a more general, nonlinear model to the events of the Gao et al. (2012a) study. A nonlinear relationship can be established by use of a statistical approach referred to as the additive model. We find that the more flexible additive model outperforms the linear model. However, the improvement is small. Provided that E<SUB>K-R</SUB> is used to characterize the solar wind input, results obtained from the additive model are very similar to those from the linear model. This result indicates that the linear relation between the PC index and E<SUB>K-R</SUB>, AL<SUB>U</SUB> obtained by Gao et al. (2012a) represents the data within fluctuations.",

The simulated results show that the peak enhancement of total electron content reaches about 35 TECU (total electron content unit, 1 TECU = 10<SUP>16</SUP> el m<SUP>-2</SUP>), and there are as long as more than 4 h ionospheric disturbances induced by the extreme solar flare. At the same time, the extreme solar flare causes significant disturbances in the thermosphere. The peak enhancement of neutral density at 400 km reaches more than 100%, and the peak enhancement in neutral temperature at 400 km is about 250 K. Several numerical experiments for different class solar flares were further carried out to study the ionosphere and thermosphere variations with solar flare level. The results show that the increasing amplitude of electron density at low altitude decreases with increasing flare level; however, the increasing amplitude of electron density at topside ionosphere increases with increasing flare level. The thermosphere density has the same variation trends with flare level. These results suggest that the extreme solar flare would cause the strong disturbances at high height.",

All passes were divided into three angular sectors near 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 \u03b8<SUB>E</SUB> angles in order to estimate the role of the interplanetary magnetic field direction in plasma and magnetic properties of dayside Martian magnetosphere. The time interval chosen was from 17 January to 4 February 2016 when MAVEN was crossing the dayside magnetosphere at solar zenith angle 70\u00b0. Magnetosphere as the region with prevailing energetic planetary ions is always found between the magnetosheath and the ionosphere. The analysis of dayside interaction region showed that for each angular sector with different orientation of the solar wind electric field vector E = -1/c V \u00d7 B one can find specific profiles of the magnetosheath, the magnetic barrier (Michel, 1971, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/RG009i002p00427\">https://doi.org/10.1029/RG009i002p00427</A>; Zhang et al., 1991, https://doi.org/10.1029/91JA00088), and the magnetosphere. Magnetic barrier forms in front of the magnetosphere, and relative magnetic field magnitudes in these two domains vary. The average height of the boundary with ionosphere is 530 km, and the average height of the magnetopause is 730 km. We discuss the implications of the observed magnetosphere structure to the planetary ions loss mechanism.",

         "abstract": "We have taken a key step in evaluating the importance of ionospheric outflows relative to electrodynamic coupling in the thermosphere's impact on geospace dynamics. We isolated the thermosphere's material influence and suppressed electrodynamic feedback in whole geospace simulations by imposing a time constant ionospheric conductance in the ionospheric Ohm's law in a coupled model that combines the multifluid Lyon Fedder Mobarry magnetosphere model with the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model and the Ionosphere Polar Wind Model that includes both polar wind and transversely accelerated ion species. Numerical experiments were conducted for different thermospheric states parameterized by F10.7 for interplanetary driving representative of the stream interaction region that swept past Earth on March 27, 2003. We demonstrate that thermosphere through its regulation of ionospheric outflows influences magnetosphere ionosphere (MI) convection and the ion composition, symmetries, x line perimeter and magnetic merging of the magnetosphere. Feedback to the ionosphere thermosphere from evolving MI convection, and Alfv\u00e9nic Poynting fluxes and soft (\u223cfew 100 eV) electron precipitation originating in the magnetosphere, in turn, modify the evolving O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow properties. The simulation results identify a variety of observed magnetospheric features that are attributable directly to the thermosphere's material influence: Asymmetries in O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow fluxes and velocities in the pre/postnoon low altitude magnetosphere, dawn/duskside lobes and pre/postmidnight plasmasheet; O<SUP>+</SUP> distribution of the plasmasheet; magnetic x line location and reconnection rate along it. O<SUP>+</SUP> outflows during solar maximum conditions (high F10.7) tend to counteract the plasmasheet's pre/postmidnight asymmetries caused by the night to day gradient in ionospheric Hall conductance.",

         "abstract": "At the beginning of 2007 the twin STEREO spacecraft provided a unique opportunity to study the global solar wind control of the terrestrial magnetotail under typical solar activity minimum conditions. The STEREO-B (STB) spacecraft flew in the vicinity of the far terrestrial magnetotail, while the STEREO-A (STA) spacecraft was located in front of the Earth performing measurements in the undisturbed solar wind. In February, the STB spacecraft was located in the magnetosheath most of the time but experienced several incursions into the distant magnetotail. Comparison of STA and STB observations determines unambiguously whether solar wind events such as energetic particle enhancements observed by STB are of pure solar origin or due to the influence of the terrestrial magnetosphere. During this time period in 2007, there were solar minimum conditions with alternating fast and slow solar wind streams that formed corotating interaction regions, which were the dominating source of magnetospheric disturbances encountering the Earth almost every week. Under these conditions, STB experienced multiple bow shock and magnetopause crossings due to the induced highly dynamic behavior of the terrestrial magnetotail and detected bursts of tailward directed energetic ions in the range of 110-2200 keV accompanied by suprathermal electrons of ~700-1500 eV, which were not seen in the undisturbed solar wind by STA. The corotating interaction regions triggered these energetic particle enhancements, and we demonstrate their magnetosphere-related origin. Even after leaving the magnetosheath in March 2007, STB continued to observe antisunward directed energetic ion bursts until May up to a distance of ~ 800 R<SUB>E</SUB> behind Earth, the largest distance to which solar wind and magnetospheric interaction has been observed. These results show that Earth is a very significant source of energetic particles in its local interplanetary environment.",

         "abstract": "Primary and secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz surface wave modes on the Earth's magnetopause are studied within the framework of warm plasma ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) across an infinitely thin magnetopause tangential discontinuity (TD). With the increase of background flow velocity, a Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) unstable boundary separating two uniform semi-infinite plasma regions is always ultimately stabilized to KHI growth at an upper cut-off while inclusion of an inner boundary in one plasma region removes this stabilization. Phase velocity Friedrichs diagrams are presented that allow us to identify unstable fast and slow modes that correspond to growing modes of the KHI under different magnetosphere and magnetosheath conditions. On the nightside magnetosphere, and the magnetotail, new KH unstable intermediate-fast modes are created, which cannot propagate exactly perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the plasma frame, primary unstable KH waves show fast/fast, while secondary KH waves show slow/fast mode behavior in the magnetosphere/magnetosheath. Secondary KHI occurs at slower flow speeds than the primary KHI and grows more slowly and at a narrow range of propagation angles. Our analysis is placed in the context of in situ satellite observations of the phase speed of KHI-related waves in the magnetosheath and magnetosphere in the long wavelength regime where our analysis applies. We conclude that KH unstable surface waves on the near-Earth magnetopause flanks are likely to be secondary KHI waves, while those further down the flanks and on the nightside magnetopause are likely to be primary KHI waves\u2014the latter being the most important for energy transport at the magnetopause.",

         "abstract": "Drag forces, ion and viscous, are evaluated as modifiers of global wind and temperature structure in the upper thermosphere, shedding new light on their relative roles in neutral dynamics and energetics. Exploiting the coupling of an ionosphere-thermosphere model, it is discovered that ion and viscous drag forces lead to sustained divergent winds, adjustments in mass, modification of pressure gradients, and a redistribution of the radiatively forced thermal energy. The interplay between the relative magnitudes of the ion and viscous drag forces and its effect on the ionosphere-thermosphere system has not yet been addressed and results in diverse behavior in the neutral wind and temperature structures of the upper atmosphere, dependent upon the type of drag acting on the gas. It is found that viscous drag is more efficient in cooling the dayside thermosphere and heating the nightside than the ion drag force in solar maximum and under quiet geomagnetic activity, resulting in a 150 K day-night temperature difference. The ion drag force inhibits this effective day-to-night energy circulation, culminating in a dynamically induced difference of about 400 K in the day-night temperature difference. It is demonstrated that the resultant wind and thermal structure greatly depends on the type of drag force environment, and a mechanism is introduced whereby ion and viscous drag forces can alter the energy budget of the upper thermosphere system. For example, in solar minimum, viscous drag is significant relative to other forces and more effectively cools the dayside and warms the nightside, thereby reducing the day-night temperature gradient.",

         "abstract": "In this paper we report a study on the plasma signatures (electron temperature, plasma density, and field-aligned current) of patchy pulsating auroras in the upper F region ionosphere using Swarm satellite data. Via a survey of 38 patch crossing events, we repeatedly identify a strong electron temperature enhancement associated with the pulsating aurora. On average, the electron temperature at Swarm satellite altitudes ( 460 km) increases from 2200 K at subauroral latitudes to a peak of 3000 K within the pulsating auroral patch. This indicates that pulsating auroras may act as an important heating source for the nightside ionosphere. On the other hand, no well-defined trend of plasma density variations associated with pulsating auroras is identified at Swarm altitudes. The field-aligned currents within the pulsating aurora patch are mostly upward, with mean magnitudes on order of 1 \u03bcA/m<SUP>2</SUP>. We then perform a numerical simulation to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the strong electron heating associated with the pulsating aurora. Via simulations we find that to account for the realistic electron temperature observation in a major portion of our events, pulsating auroras are likely accompanied by substantial magnetospheric heat fluxes around the order of 10<SUP>10</SUP> eV/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. We propose that such magnetospheric heat fluxes may be pertinent to one long-hypothesized feature of pulsating auroras, namely, the coexistence of an enhanced low-energy plasma population in magnetic flux tubes threading the pulsating aurora, in addition to the energetic electron precipitation. Via a Swarm survey we repeatedly find a strong electron temperature enhancement associated with the pulsating aurora The field-aligned currents within pulsating auroras are moderately upward, with mean magnitudes on the order of 1e-6 A/m<SUP>2</SUP> To explain the observed electron heating, pulsating auroras are likely accompanied by magnetospheric heat fluxes around 1E+10 eV/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/s.",

This emission is the result of an electrical current system, which couples the magnetosphere to the planetary atmosphere in an attempt to enforce the corotation of the middle magnetospheric plasma. Field-aligned currents transfer angular momentum from the atmosphere to the magnetosphere. In the equatorial plane, the field-aligned currents diverge into radially outward currents, which exert a torque on the plasma due to the J \u00d7 B forces. Equatorward ionospheric currents exert an opposite torque on the ionosphere, which interacts with the thermosphere via ion-neutral collisions. The upward field-aligned currents result in auroral electron precipitation, depositing energy into the high-latitude atmosphere. This energy input is a possible candidate for explaining the large thermospheric temperature measured by the Galileo probe at equatorial latitudes; however, previous atmospheric circulation models have shown that the bulk of the energy is transported poleward, rather than equatorward. We present numerical results of Jupiter's coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system including, for the first time, field-aligned potentials. The model is compared with three previously published works. We find that the rotational decoupling of the magnetospheric and thermospheric angular velocities in the presence of field-aligned potentials tempers the thermospheric response to the outward transport of magnetospheric plasma, but this is a secondary effect to variations in the Pedersen conductance.",

         "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate that dissipation of upward propagating tides produces significant changes in the mean temperature of the thermosphere, ranging from +19 K at solar minimum to -15 K at solar maximum in the equatorial region. Our methodology consists of measuring the differential response of the thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIE-GCM) under solar minimum and solar maximum conditions to constant tidal forcing at its 97 km lower boundary, as specified by the observationally based Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere. Diagnosis of the model reveals that these changes are mainly driven by 5.3 \u03bcm nitric oxide (NO) cooling, which more efficiently cools the thermosphere at solar maximum. The main role of the tides is to modify the mean molecular oxygen densities ([O<SUB>2</SUB>]) through tidal-induced advective transport, which then lead to changes in NO densities through oxygen-nitrogen chemistry. Through tidal-induced changes in temperature and O, O<SUB>2</SUB>, and N<SUB>2</SUB> densities, effects on the ionosphere are also quite substantial; tidal-induced modifications to zonal-mean F region peak electron densities (N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB>) are of order -10% at solar maximum and -30% at solar minimum in the equatorial region. Our results introduce an additional consideration when attributing long-term changes in thermospheric temperature and electron densities to CO<SUB>2</SUB> cooling effects alone; that is, dissipation of upward propagating tides may constitute an additional element of global change in the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system.",

         "abstract": "A high correlation between a pulsating auroral patch and grouped chorus waves was observed on 17 April 2006 at Syowa Station in Antarctica. The spatial distribution of aurora-chorus correlation coefficients is evaluated in order to determine the source region. A pulsating patch at the highest-correlation pixel shows a one-to-one correspondence with the intensity variation of the grouped chorus waves, consisting of successive rising-tone elements with a duration and spacing of 2-3 s and 20-30 s, respectively. The generation region of the chorus waves is estimated from the latitude and longitude dependence of the equatorial electron gyrofrequencies using the IGRF geomagnetic field model. The extent of the estimated latitude and longitude is consistent with the spatial distribution of the high-correlation aurora-chorus region. The time difference between the chorus waves and the scattered electrons is also evaluated to discuss the validity of the source region. It shows that electrons reached the ionosphere sooner than the associated chorus waves by \u223c1 s, consistent with the theoretical value for conjugate pulsating aurora generated at the equator. These results support the hypothesis that pulsating aurora is caused by pitch angle scattering of high-energy electrons by whistler mode chorus waves, via a cyclotron resonance at the equator. These results are the first ground-based observations of high correlations between a spatially extended aurora and chorus waves.",

In the present study, we expand upon the Alfv\u00e9n wing model of CPCP saturation by investigating its impact on the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system, particularly the Region 1 FAC input into the polar cap. Our hypothesis is that the ability of open flux tubes to deform in response to applied fluid stress from the magnetosheath is governed by the magnetosheath plasma beta, which in turn governs the Maxwell stress imposed on ionospheric plasma from the magnetosphere. We performed 32 MHD simulations with varying solar wind density and interplanetary magnetic field strength and show that the plasma beta does govern the deformation of open field lines, as well as the nonlinear response of the Region 1 FAC system to increasingly southward interplanetary magnetic field. Further, we show that the current-voltage relationship in the ionosphere also shows a dependence on the plasma beta in the magnetosheath, with the ionosphere becoming more resistive at lower beta.",

Simulations with the Space Weather Modeling Framework are used to investigate the global dynamics and energization of ions throughout the magnetosphere during storm time, with a focus on the formation and evolution of the ring current. Simulations involving multifluid (with variable H<SUP>+</SUP>/O<SUP>+</SUP> ratio in the inner magnetosphere) and single-fluid (with constant H<SUP>+</SUP>/O<SUP>+</SUP> ratio in the inner magnetosphere) MHD for the global magnetosphere with inner boundary conditions set either by specifying a constant ion density or by physics-based calculations of the ion fluxes reveal that dynamical changes of the ion composition in the inner magnetosphere alter the total energy density of the magnetosphere, leading to variations in the magnetic field as well as particle drifts throughout the simulated domain. A low oxygen to hydrogen ratio and outflow resulting from a constant ion density boundary produced the most disturbed magnetosphere, leading to a stronger ring current but misses the timing of the storm development. Conversely, including a physics-based solution for the ionospheric outflow to the magnetosphere system leads to a reduction in the cross-polar cap potential (CPCP). The increased presence of oxygen in the inner magnetosphere affects the global magnetospheric structure and dynamics and brings the nightside reconnection point closer to the Earth. The combination of reduced CPCP together with the formation of the reconnection line closer to the Earth yields less adiabatic heating in the magnetotail and reduces the amount of energetic plasma that has access to the inner magnetosphere.",

The evidence for the occurrence of magnetic reconnection in these events is critically examined. It is found that they are not compelling cases for magnetic reconnection as the substorm trigger. Instead, equally plausible alternative interpretations, such as current disruption by ballooning and/or cross-field current instabilities, global Alfv\u00e9nic interaction, and new plasma intrusion, that do not necessarily require a change of magnetic field line topology, could be the substorm trigger.

To investigate signal propagation paths and signal travel times, we use a magnetohydrodynamic global simulation model of the Earth magnetosphere and ionosphere, OpenGGCM-CTIM model. By creating single impulse or sinusoidal pulsations in various locations in the magnetotail, the waves are launched, and we investigate the paths taken by the waves and the time that different waves take to reach the ionosphere. We find that it takes approximately about 27, 36, 45, 60, and 72 s for waves to travel from the tail plasma sheet at x =- 10,-15,-20,-25, and -30R<SUB>E</SUB>, respectively, to the ionosphere, contrary to previous reports.

         "abstract": "This study reports a comprehensive survey of quasi 3 day (2.5-4.5 day period) planetary-scale waves in the low-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere using the temperature observations from Thermosphere Ionosphere and Mesosphere Electric Dynamics/Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry throughout 2002-2012. Occurrences and properties of the waves, including the eastward propagating zonal wave numbers of 1-3 (E1-E3) and vertical wavelengths, are determined for each case. The impacts of these waves on the equatorial ionosphere are investigated by searching for the corresponding variations with the same periods and wave numbers in total electron content (TEC) from the concurrent observations of the ground-based GPS network. For a threshold amplitude of 4 K in temperature, a total of 300 waves are identified, of which there are 186 E1, 63 E2, and 51 E3 events. The mean amplitudes and vertical wavelengths of these waves are calculated to be about 7.9 K and 34 km for the E1, 5.7 K and 29 km for the E2, and 5.1 K and 27 km for the E3, having the standard deviations of 1.5 K and 6.5 km, 0.6 K and 5.6 km, and 0.5 K and 6.7 km. Occurrences of the E1 cases are not observed to depend on season, but the large-amplitude (&gt;8 K) cases occur more often during solstices than at equinoxes. Similarly, the E2 and E3 cases are observed to occur most often in January-February and May-August. Among these waves, 199 cases (66%) are found to have the corresponding variations in the equatorial ionosphere with amplitudes \u22654.2% relative to the mean TEC values (corresponding to 90th percentile). Most of these waves have long vertical wavelengths and large amplitudes (\u223c3 times more than short vertical wavelength and small-amplitude waves). Because no seasonal or solar cycle dependence on the frequency at which these waves have corresponding variations in the ionosphere at this TEC perturbation threshold is observed, we conclude that there is no seasonal and solar cycle dependence on the propagation of such waves from the mesopause region to higher altitudes. We also identify that only 28 cases (19%) of the E1 TEC variations do not correspond to any E1 waves, which is consistent with the hypothesis that E1 waves are the primary cause of E1 TEC variations. Conditions that are favorable for 3 day waves to create ionospheric variations are present approximately two thirds of the time. This study quantifies the importance and frequency of atmospheric quasi 3 day planetary-scale waves on the day-to-day variations of the equatorial ionosphere using a statistical rather than case study approach.",

We use a sparse matrix method to avoid significant matrix related calculation and storage. A series of observing system simulation experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the system. The results show that the system optimizes ionosphere drivers efficiently by assimilating electron densities through their covariance. The short-term forecast capability is enhanced significantly, and the effect of initial condition correction lasts for longer than 24 hr. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the EnKF-based global ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation can be conducted without using a supercomputer. This workstation-based EnKF ionosphere and thermosphere data assimilation system benefits both scientific studies and near-real-time operation.",

Calculations with a comprehensive physical model reveal that large downward ion fluxes from the plasmasphere are the main cause of the enhancements. These large fluxes are enabled by large upward H<SUP>+</SUP> fluxes into the plasmasphere from the conjugate summer hemisphere during the daytime. The nighttime downward H<SUP>+</SUP> flux at Kharkiv is sensitive to the thermosphere model H density, which had to be increased by factors of 2 to 3 to obtain model-data agreement for the topside H<SUP>+</SUP> density. Other studies support the need for increasing the thermosphere model H density for all seasons at solar minimum. It was found that neutral winds are less effective than plasmaspheric fluxes for maintaining the nighttime ionosphere. This is partly because increased equatorward winds simultaneously oppose the downward H<SUP>+</SUP> flux. The model calculations also reveal the need for a modest additional heat flow from the plasmasphere in the afternoon. This source could be the quiet time ring current.",

Runs are performed for solar wind TDs possessing different polarization senses of magnetic field (north-to-south or south-to-north from the leading to trailing side of the incident TD) and initial half-widths. Two-step compression processes are shown in the transmitted TD, including a \u201cshock compression,\u201d as the TD passes through the shock followed by a subsequent \u201cconvective compression\u201d while the TD is moving in the magnetosheath toward the magnetopause. In cases with a relatively thin solar wind TD, 3-D patchy reconnection is initiated in the transmitted TD, forming magnetosheath flux ropes. Differences between these flux ropes and those due to magnetopause reconnection are discussed. Multiple components of ion particles are present in the velocity distribution in the magnetosheath merging, accompanied by ion heating. For cases with a relatively wide initial TD, a dominant single X line appears in the subsolar magnetosheath after the transmitted TD is narrowed through the two-step compression process. Specifically, in the cases with a south-to-north field rotation across an incident thin TD, the magnetosheath flux ropes could re-reconnect with the closed geomagnetic field lines to generate a closed field line region with mixed magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas, which may contribute to the transport of solar wind plasma into the magnetospheric boundary layer.",

Under an initially southward IMF, the magnetosheath reconnection could interact with reconnection at the magnetopause. In this study, using three dimensional (3D) global scale hybrid simulations, we present cases with incoming tangential discontinuities (TDs) in an initially southward IMF, which possess various magnetic field rotation angles (\u0394\u03a6) and half width (w), to study the effects of pre existing magnetopause reconnection on the formation of magnetosheath flux ropes, as well as the subsequent interaction between the magnetopause reconnection and magnetosheath reconnection, with downstreams of both Quasi perpendicular (Q \u22a5) and Quasi parallel (Q ||) shock examined. The initial IMF is assumed to be oblique, with a finite B<SUB>x</SUB> and B<SUB>z</SUB>, similar to that in Guo et al. (2018), <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2018ja025679\">https://doi.org/10.1029/2018ja025679</A> but with a southward B<SUB>z</SUB> &lt; 0. Compared with the cases with an initially northward IMF, magnetopause reconnection weakens the compression processes of the TD and leads to less frequent reconnection in the magnetosheath. The existence and the structure of magnetosheath reconnection are found to strongly depend on the parameters w and \u0394\u03a6 of the TD. When interacting with the magnetopause reconnection, the magnetosheath flux ropes can re reconnect with the geomagnetic dipole field lines, forming new structures of magnetopause flux ropes. The resulting evolution of flux rope configuration is illustrated.",

We find a close spatiotemporal relationship of the SCW with many other essential signatures of substorm activity in the magnetotail and demonstrate its azimuthally localized structure and stepwise expansion in the magnetotail. We confirm that ground SCW diagnostics makes it possible to reconstruct and organize the azimuthal spatiotemporal substorm development pattern with accuracy better than 1 h magnetic local time (MLT) in the case of medium-scale substorm. The Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE)-based study of global field-aligned current distribution indicates that (a) the SCW-related field-aligned current system consists of simultaneously activated R1- and R2-type currents, (b) their net currents have a R1-sense, and (c) locations of net current peaks are consistent with the SCW edge locations inferred from midlatitude variations. Thanks to good azimuthal coverage of four GOES and three Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms spacecraft, we evaluated the intensities of the SCW R1- and R2-like current loops (using the SCW2L model) obtained from combined magnetospheric and ground midlatitude magnetic observations and found the net currents consistent (within a factor of 2) with the AMPERE-based estimate. We also ran an adaptive magnetospheric model and show that SCW2L model outperforms it in predicting the magnetic configuration changes during substorm dipolarizations.",

This inductive-dynamic approach we use is fundamentally different from those in previous magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling models: all MHD wave modes are retained, and energy and momentum exchange between waves and plasma are incorporated into the governing equations, allowing a self-consistent examination of dynamic M-I coupling. Simulations, using an implicit numerical scheme, of the 1-D ionosphere/thermosphere system responding to an imposed convection velocity at the top boundary are presented to show how magnetosphere and ionosphere are coupled through Alfv\u00e9n waves during the transient stage when the IT system changes from one quasi steady state to another. Wave reflection from the low-altitude ionosphere plays an essential role, causing overshoots and oscillations of ionospheric perturbations, and the dynamical Hall effect is an inherent aspect of the M-I coupling. The simulations demonstrate that the ionosphere/thermosphere responds to magnetospheric driving forces as a damped oscillator.",

         "abstract": "Although the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral ionosphere contains interesting dynamic phenomena that may significantly impact the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system, it has been much less studied than the dusk-to-premidnight sector. We discuss a dynamic phenomenon in the postmidnight-to-dawn sector of the auroral oval, eastward fast flows mainly within the expanse of the Region 1 current (its part equatorward of the polar cap). These flows peak and have a steep speed gradient (increase from low to high latitude) near the interface between the Region 1 and Region 2 currents. Because such flows correspond to an electric field that most likely comes from enhanced Region 2 currents and an associated spatial conductivity gradient, their generation mechanism is analogous to that of a subauroral polarization stream. Therefore, we refer to such an eastward flow as a dawnside auroral polarization stream (DAPS). We show several examples of the presence and absence of DAPS under different geomagnetic activity levels. A DAPS' electric field can heat the ionosphere (and thus the thermosphere), change the convection pattern of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and modify the drift path of magnetospheric particles. Because a DAPS' flow peak maps to a major site of magnetic-kinetic energy conversion in the magnetosphere (the transition region between dipole and stretched field), it may be important for the conversion. A DAPS' steep flow gradient is also potentially important; it may lead to instabilities, such as that responsible for auroral Omega bands. Given its potential importance, knowledge of DAPS is fundamental for understanding the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system.",

         "abstract": "An auroral substorm is a disturbance in the magnetosphere that releases energy stored in the magnetotail into the high-latitude ionosphere. By definition, an auroral substorm commences when a discrete auroral arc brightens and subsequently expands poleward and azimuthally. The arc that brightens is usually the most equatorward of several auroral arcs that remain quiescent for ~5 to ~60 min before the breakup commences. This arc is often referred to as the \"preexisting auroral arc (PAA)\" or the \"growth-phase arc.\" In this study, we use FAST measurements to establish the statistics of flow patterns near PAAs in the ionosphere. We find that flow shear is present in the vicinity of a preexisting arc. When a PAA appears in the evening sector, enhanced westward flow develops equatorward of the arc, whereas when a PAA appears in the morning sector, enhanced eastward flow develops poleward of the arc. We benchmark locations of the PAAs relative to large-scale field-aligned currents (FACs) and convective flows in the ionosphere, finding that the arc forms in the upward current region within ~1\u00b0 of the Region 1/Region 2 boundary in all local time sectors from 20 MLT to 03 MLT. We also find that near midnight in the Harang region, most of the PAAs lie within 0.5\u00b0 poleward of the low-latitude Region 1/Region 2 currents boundary and sit between the westward and eastward flow peak but equatorward of the flow reversal point. Finally, we examine arc-associated electrodynamics and find that the FAC of the PAA is mainly closed by the north-south Pedersen current in the ionosphere.",

On the basis of the steady state magnetosphere results, we trace streamlines of FAC from the ionosphere to draw the global geometry of current streamlines in the magnetosphere. Unlike those cases in which the IMF is purely northward or southward, the introduction of the dominant IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> significantly changes the topologies of the current streamlines. Cusp and mantle currents arise, and the symmetry of the FAC across the noon-night meridional plane breaks in the ionosphere. In addition to the self-closed currents in the Northern or Southern hemispheres, three more types of current streamlines connecting the two ionospheres are shown from the simulation results. The first current, including the cusp current, originates from the southern ionosphere and flows into the northern ionosphere. The second current, mainly the mantle current, and the tail current are connected to form a single current system, threading most of the magnetosphere along a spiral-like path and closing through the two lobes in the far magnetotail. The third current flowing out of the southern and into the northern ionosphere connects the two ionospheres by finally closing through the bow shock instead of the magnetopause. Quantitative results are presented and discussed for the four types of current streamlines and indicate that for the dominant IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> conditions the bow shock current should be included among the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.",

The model solves, self-consistently, Maxwell's equations, continuity, momentum, and energy equations for multiple ion and neutral species incorporating photochemistry, collisions among the electron, ion and neutral species, and various heating sources in the energy equations. The inductive-dynamic approach (solving self-consistently Faraday's law and retaining inertia terms in the plasma momentum equations) used in the model retains all possible MHD waves, thus providing faithful physical explanation (not merely description) of the magnetosphere-ionosphere/thermosphere (M-IT) coupling. In the present study, we simulate the dawn-dusk cross-polar cap dynamic responses of the ionosphere to imposed magnetospheric convection. It is shown that the convection velocity at the top boundary launches velocity, magnetic, and electric perturbations propagating with the Alfv\u00e9n speed toward the bottom of the ionosphere. Within the system, the waves experience reflection, penetration, and rereflection because of the inhomogeneity of the plasma conditions. The reflection of the Alfv\u00e9n waves may cause overshoot (stronger than the imposed magnetospheric convection) of the plasma velocity in some regions. The simulation demonstrates dynamic propagation of the field-aligned currents and ionospheric electric field carried by the Alfv\u00e9n waves, as well as formation of closure horizontal currents (Pedersen currents in the E region), indicating that in the dynamic stage the M-I coupling is via the Alfv\u00e9n waves instead of field-aligned currents or electric field mapping as described in convectional M-I coupling models.",

(1985). Although the preliminary and main frequency deviations (PFD, MFD) of the SCF have been attributed to the dusk-to-dawn and dawn-to-dusk potential electric fields, there still remain questions if the positive PFD can be caused by the compressional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave and what causes the evening anomaly of the SCF. With the HF Doppler sounder, we show that the dayside ionosphere moves upward toward the Sun during the main impulse (MI) of the SC, when the compressional wave is supposed to push the ionosphere downward. The motion of the ionosphere is shown to be correlated with the equatorial electrojet, matching the potential electric field transmitted with the ionospheric currents from the polar ionosphere. We confirmed that the electric field of the compressional wave is severely suppressed by the conducting ionosphere and reproduced the SC electric fields using the global MHD simulation in which the potential solver is employed. The model calculations well reproduced the preliminary impulse and MI electric fields and their evening anomaly. It is suggested that the electric potential is transmitted from the polar ionosphere to the equator by the zeroth-order transverse magnetic (TM0) mode waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. The near-instantaneous transmission of the electric potential leads to instantaneous global response of the incompressible ionosphere.",

For each simulation, the model was run for 30 days in order to study the long-term evolution of the plasmasphere-ionosphere system. The goal is to study the combined effect of corotation and convection, which causes eventually a lag of the flux tube motion with respect to the Earth. This combination of nonuniform rotation and subcorotation in average becomes important especially in the outer plasmasphere and causes nonuniform drift of the dipole tilt projection in the plane of the flux tube with time, changing drastically the plasma distribution along this flux tube. In the classical representation of the plasmasphere, the ionosphere only depends on angular Magnetic Local Time (MLT) sector. We show that due to the tilt effect, solar illumination along the flux tube and field-aligned transport varies from one day to the other and causes also a day-to-day variation in the plasma distribution along the tube. This effect implies that a stable representation of the plasmasphere in MLT during quiet conditions is an erroneous view, and no real dynamic equilibrium can be reached, in particular close to the stagnation point.",

The magnetotail measurements are obtained by using GPS-orbit measurements that magnetically map out into the magnetotail. Four temporal phases of high-speed-stream-driven storms are studied: (1) the pre-storm density decay of the electron-radiation belt, (2) the electron-radiation-belt density dropout near the time of storm onset, (3) the rapid density recovery a few hours after dropout, and (4) the heating of the electron radiation belt during the high-speed-stream-driven geomagnetic activity. In all four phases the behaviors of the outer electron radiation belt and of the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail are the same and simultaneous. The physical explanations for the behavior in phase 1 (decay), phase 2 (dropout), and phase 4 (heating) lie in the dipolar regions of the magnetosphere: hence for those three phases it is concluded that the temporal behavior of the energetic-electron population in the magnetotail mimics the behavior of the outer electron radiation belt. Behavior attributable to physical processes in the dipole is seen in the magnetotail energetic-electron population: this implies that the origin of the energetic-electron population of the magnetotail is \u201cleakage\u201d or \u201coutward evaporation\u201d from the outer electron radiation belt in the dipolar magnetosphere.",

Internal waves are extremely important in the atmosphere, and past global studies have looked at the impacts of gravity waves on the thermosphere using gravity wave parameterizations. Here, in contrast, a medium-scale gravity wave is studied in a global thermosphere-ionosphere model, to determine the 3-D characteristics of the wave as it propagated upward through the thermosphere. The model used is a time-dependent, high-resolution, numerical model of the global thermosphere-ionosphere system, which produces global distributions of mass density, temperature, and all three components of the neutral wind at altitudes from 90 to 500 km. The gravity wave horizontal wavelengths that are measured in the thermosphere are hundreds to thousands of kilometers, with periods associated with these waves of about an hour. Therefore, a gravity wave that is physical, present in the thermosphere, and resolvable in the global numerical model was generated for this study; this wave is a 1000 km horizontal wavelength wave with a 3 h period. The gravity wave grows in amplitude, reaches a critical state and then breaks, creating curved wavefronts, and depositing its energy locally. As the gravity wave breaks, depositing its energy, a secondary wave is generated from the original gravity wave, with horizontal wavelengths of 4000 to 5000 km. The secondary wave propagates globally, unlike the original gravity wave, which only propagates in a local area. The original gravity wave had amplitudes for density and temperature of 35% and \u00b1100 K, respectively, while the secondary wave had amplitudes of 5% and \u00b120 K, respectively.",

In this context, a special role is played by field-aligned currents (FACs), which drive energy and momentum exchanges between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, deeply affecting the energy balance of the latter. One of the most relevant physical quantities that may help to fully characterize FACs is the ionospheric electrical conductivity. Understanding the features associated with this quantity may contribute to the advancement of knowledge on the mechanisms of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction as well as energy storage and dissipation involved in the space weather phenomena. By extending a previous study, we investigate the dependence of the electrical conductivity parallel to the geomagnetic field on solar and geomagnetic activity. To this aim, we considered a six-year long data set of in-situ electron density and temperature values recorded by the Langmuir probes on board the Swarm satellites in the topside ionosphere. With this large data set, we computed global maps of the parallel electron conductivity under both quiet and disturbed conditions, and for different solar activity levels. In both cases, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model allowed estimating the contribution of particle precipitation to electrical conductivity.",

Compressional wave power is dominant throughout most of the magnetosphere, while azimuthal wave power close to the dayside magnetopause provides evidence that interactions between the magnetosheath and the magnetopause such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may be driving wave activity. Further evidence of this is found in the average wave polarization: left-handed polarized waves dominate the dawnside magnetosphere, while right-handed polarized waves dominate the duskside. A possible field line resonance event is also presented, where a time-of-flight calculation is used to provide an estimated local plasma mass density of \u223c240 amu cm<SUP>-3</SUP>.",

         "abstract": "This paper discusses the major pathways of electron distribution function formation in the region of diffuse aurora. The diffuse aurora accounts for about of 75% of the auroral energy precipitating into the upper atmosphere, and its origin has been the subject of much discussion. We show that an earthward stream of precipitating electrons initially injected from the Earth<SUP>'</SUP>s plasma sheet via wave-particle interactions degrades in the atmosphere toward lower energies and produces secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These electrons of magnetospheric origin are then reflected back into the magnetosphere along closed dipolar magnetic field lines, leading to a series of reflections and consequent magnetospheric interactions that greatly augment the initially precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km). To date this, systematic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling element has not been included in auroral research models, and, as we demonstrate in this article, has a dramatic effect (200-300%) on the formation of the precipitating fluxes that result in the diffuse aurora. It is shown that wave-particle interaction processes that drive precipitating fluxes in the region of diffuse aurora from the magnetospheric altitudes are only the first step in the formation of electron precipitation at ionospheric altitudes, and they cannot be separated from the atmospheric \"collisional machine\" that redistributes and transfers their energy inside the magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling system.",

(2017, <A href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024223\">https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024223</A>) suggested that time domain structures (TDSs) drive pulsating aurora (with additional contributions by kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves (KAWs)) and that chorus waves have negligible effects. In this comment, we point out that electrons scattered by TDS or KAW (dominantly at 0.1-3 keV, &lt;1 s modulation) cannot explain key features of pulsating aurora, which require precipitation above a few keV with a couple of tens of second modulation. Their study did not conduct quantitative evaluations of wave-aurora correlation. The use of short burst mode data ( &lt;10 s) may only cover a single pulse of pulsating aurora and is not suitable for examining connections to pulsating aurora. \"Field-aligned\" electrons do not necessarily represent loss cone population, and their characteristic energy (hundreds of eV) is much lower than typical precipitation over pulsating aurora. By reexamining the events studied by Mozer et al., we quantitatively demonstrate that TDS and KAW are uncorrelated with pulsating aurora and that only chorus waves showed high correlations with pulsating aurora. Occasional simultaneous occurrence of TDS/KAW and pulsating aurora is found to be coincidental, because the correlation over a time scale of minutes is poor. Several auroral features analyzed in that paper are not pulsating aurora but other types of aurora. We also show that the chorus-pulsating aurora correlation can last for 2 h or longer and can be used to highlight dynamic changes in magnetic field mapping. Chorus waves can resonate with electrons above a few keV and are in agreement with pulsating auroral properties.",

The ensemble is generated by perturbing either the high-latitude electric potential or auroral energy flux in the assimilative mapping for ionosphere electrodynamics (AMIE). Simulations with perturbed high-latitude electric potential result in substantial intraensemble variability in the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to the geomagnetic storm, and the ensemble standard deviation for the change in N<SUB>m</SUB>F<SUB>2</SUB> reaches 50-100% of the mean change. Such large intraensemble variability is not seen when perturbing the auroral energy flux. In this case, the effects of the forcing uncertainty are primarily confined to high latitudes. We therefore conclude that the specification of high-latitude electric fields is an important source of uncertainty when modeling the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to a geomagnetic storm. A multiple linear regression analysis of the results indicates that uncertainty in the storm time changes in the equatorial electric fields, neutral winds, and neutral composition can all contribute to the uncertainty in the ionosphere electron density. The results of the present study provide insight into the possible uncertainty in simulations of the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to geomagnetic storms due to imperfect knowledge of the high-latitude forcing.",

         "abstract": "Ionospheric disturbances, often associated with geomagnetic storms, may cause threats to radio systems used for communication and navigation. One example is the super storm on 20 November 2003, when plenty of strong and unusual perturbations were reported. This paper reveals additional information on the dynamics in the high-latitude ionosphere over Europe during this storm. Here analyses of wavelike traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) over Europe are presented, based on estimates of the total electron content (TEC) derived from ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. These TIDs are ionospheric signatures of thermospheric surges initiated by space weather events. The source region of these TIDs is characterized by enhanced spatial gradients, TEC depression, strong uplift of the F<SUB>2</SUB> layer, the vicinity of the eastward auroral electrojet, and strong aurora E layers. Joule heating is identified as the most probable driver for the TIDs observed over Europe during 20 November 2003. The sudden heating of the thermosphere leads to strong changes in the pressure and thermospheric wind circulation system, which in turn generates thermospheric wind surges observed as TID signatures in the TEC. Either the dissipation of the eastward auroral electrojet or particle precipitation are considered as the source mechanism for the Joule heating. In the course of the storm, the TEC observations show a southward shift of the source region of the TIDs. These meridional dislocation effects are obviously related to a strong compression of the plasmasphere. The presented results demonstrate the complex interaction processes in the thermosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system during this extreme storm.",

         "abstract": "Observations of Saturn's ultraviolet and infrared aurora show structures that, when traced along the planetary magnetic field, map to the inner, middle, and outer magnetosphere. From low to high latitudes the structures seen in the UV are the Enceladus footprint, which maps to an equatorial radius of 4 R<SUB>S</SUB> (Saturn radii); a diffuse emission that maps to a broad equatorial region from 4-11 R<SUB>S</SUB> on the nightside; and a bright ring of emission that maps to \u223c15 R<SUB>S</SUB>. With the exception of the Enceladus spot, the magnetospheric drivers for these auroral emissions are not yet fully understood. We apply a 1D spatial, 2D velocity space Vlasov solver to flux tubes mapping from equatorial radii of 4, 6, 9, and 13 R<SUB>S</SUB> to Saturn's southern atmosphere. The aim is to globally characterize the field-aligned potential structure and plasma density profiles. The ionospheric properties - the field-aligned current densities at the ionospheric boundary, energy intensity profiles and fluxes of the electrons precipitating into the ionosphere - are also determined. We then couple our results to an ionospheric model to calculate the Pedersen conductances at the foot of the relevant flux tubes. We find that for a zero net potential drop between the ionosphere and magnetosphere, there exists a sharp potential drop at \u223c1.5 R<SUB>S</SUB> along the magnetic field line as measured from the planetary center. The strength of this potential drop is approximately equal to that of the ambipolar potential resulting from the centrifugal confinement of the heavy, cold magnetospheric ion population. We also find that the ionospheric properties respond to changes in the magnetospheric plasma population, which are reflected in the nature of the precipitating electron population. For the flux tube mapping to 9 R<SUB>S</SUB> (-70\u00b0), the incident electron energy flux into the ionosphere resulting from a magnetospheric plasma population with a small fraction of hot electrons is an order of magnitude less than that inferred from observations, implying that significant high-latitude field-aligned potentials (up to 1.5 keV) may exist in the saturnian magnetosphere. Calculated ionospheric Pedersen conductances range from 3.0-18.9 mho, and are thus not expected to limit the currents flowing between the ionosphere and magnetosphere.",

Our results show that the IMF discontinuity, which has a transition front perpendicular to the Sun-Jupiter line, has strong effects on the Jovian MI system depending on local times and radial distances to Jupiter. The magnetospheric significant response to the discontinuity is delayed by \u223c2-6 hr after the encounter of the discontinuity front with the bow shock, while the delay time for the ionospheric field-aligned currents (FACs) is \u223c3-8 hr. The outer magnetosphere, particularly at dayside, tends to respond slightly quicker than the inner regions. At the ionosphere, the response of downward FACs is found to occur earlier than that of the upward ones by a time ranging from less than 1 hr to several hours, which is also more prominent at dayside sectors. Using a new MI mapping method with Jupiter's JRM09 magnetic field model, we reproduce for the first time the ionospheric FACs consistent with the morphology of the observed ultraviolet (UV) main auroral emissions. This indicates a potential application of the simulated upward FACs on the morphology of the UV main auroral ovals.",

In this paper, we first statistically analyzed the growth phase pressures using Geotail and Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms data and identified that solar wind dynamic pressure (P<SUB>SW</SUB>), energy loading, and sunspot number as the three primary factors controlling the growth phase pressure change. We then constructed a 2-D equatorial empirical pressure model and an error model within r \u2264 20 R<SUB>E</SUB> using the Support Vector Regression Machine with the three factors as input. The model predicts the plasma sheet pressure accurately with median errors of 5%, and predicted pressure gradients agree reasonably well with observed gradients obtained from two-probe measurements. The model shows that pressure increases linearly as P<SUB>SW</SUB> increases, and the P<SUB>SW</SUB> effect is stronger under lower energy loading. However, the pressure responses to energy loading and sunspot number are nonlinear. The pressure increases first with increasing loading or sunspot number, then remains relatively constant after reaching a peak value at ~8000 kV min loading or sunspot number of ~80. The loading effect is stronger when P<SUB>SW</SUB> is lower and the pressure variations are stronger near midnight than away from midnight. The sunspot number effect is clearer at smaller r. The pressure model can also be applied to understand the pressure changes observed during a substorm event by providing evaluations of the effects of energy loading and P<SUB>SW</SUB>, as well as the temporal and spatial effects along the spacecraft trajectory.",

         "abstract": "The ionospheric O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow varies dramatically during geomagnetic activities, but the influence of its initial characteristics on the magnetospheric dynamics has not been well established. To expand a previous study on the impact of ionospheric heavy ions outflow originating from different source regions on the magnetotail dynamics and dayside reconnection rate, this study conducts two idealized numerical experiments with different O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow densities to examine the consequent change in the magnetosphere system, especially on the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling efficiency. Results indicate that a larger O<SUP>+</SUP> outflow is capable of triggering the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) on the magnetopause flanks. The subsequent surface waves enhance the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling efficiency by transmitting more solar wind energy into the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, increasing the cross polar cap potential index. This index is initially reduced after the ionospheric mass loading owing to the direct depression in the dayside reconnection rate as commonly reported from earlier literature. The above KHI is generated under steady state solar wind conditions, suggesting that besides the commonly recognized cause, the elevated solar wind speed, ionospheric heavy ions outflow is another potential factor in disturbing the boundary by enhancing the mass density near the magnetopause and thus lowering the threshold for generating KHI. During storms, the increased ionospheric mass source causes an increased probability of KHI, which allows more solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere. This implies there is a possibility of even further nonlinear coupling between the magnetosphere and solar wind.",

         "abstract": "During geomagnetic substorms, around 10<SUP>15</SUP> J of energy is extracted from the solar wind and processed by the Earth's magnetosphere. Prior to the onset of substorm expansion phases, this energy is thought to be largely stored as an increase in the magnetic field in the magnetotail lobes. However, how, when, and where this energy is stored and released within the magnetotail is unclear. Using data from the Cluster spacecraft and substorm onsets from Substorm Onsets and Phases from Indices of the Electrojet (SOPHIE), we examine the variation in the lobe magnetic energy density with respect to substorm onset for 541 isolated onsets. Based on a cross-correlation analysis and a simple model, we deduce the following: On average, the magnetic energy density increases approximately linearly in the hour preceding onset and decreases at a similar rate after onset. The timing and magnitude of these changes varies with downtail distance, with observations from the mid-tail (X\u223c-9 R<SUB>E</SUB>) showing larger changes in the magnetic energy density that occur \u223c20 min after changes in the near-tail (X\u223c-9 R<SUB>E</SUB>). The decrease in energy density in the near-tail region is observed before the ground onset identified by SOPHIE, implying that the substorm is driven from the magnetotail and propagates into the ionosphere. The implication of these results is that energy in the near-tail region is released first during the substorm expansion phase, with energy conversion propagating away from the Earth with time.",

         "abstract": "The expanding solar wind plasma undergoes a shock transition at the interstellar boundary of the solar system and fills the inner heliosheath, the region between the termination shock and the heliopause. The nonequilibrium heliosheath plasma is a main source of energetic neutral atoms that allow remote probing of the heliospheric interface region. Global models of the heliosphere interaction with the interstellar medium often disregard solar photoionization and electron impact ionization of interstellar gas in the heliosheath. When ionization is included, it is commonly treated in a simplified manner and complexity of heliospheric interactions obscures its effect on the properties of the plasma. This work concentrates on physical estimates of ionization and shows that it may lead to significant mass loading of plasma flows in the heliosheath. In turn, mass loading would slow down plasma flows and deplete populations of nonthermal energetic protons. The magnitude of the effect depends on poorly understood and largely unknown energy transfer to electrons at the termination shock and beyond. The presented estimates show that inclusion of ionization is indispensable for global heliospheric modeling and for interpretation of heliosphere imaging in fluxes of energetic neutral atoms.",

         "abstract": "We present simultaneous observations of magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling over Svalbard during a traveling convection vortex (TCV) event. Various spaceborne and ground-based instruments made coordinated measurements, including magnetometers, particle detectors, an all-sky camera, European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) Svalbard Radar, Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), and SCANning Doppler Imager (SCANDI). The instruments recorded TCVs associated with a sudden change in solar wind dynamic pressure. The data display typical features of TCVs including vortical ionospheric convection patterns seen by the ground magnetometers and SuperDARN radars and auroral precipitation near the cusp observed by the all-sky camera. Simultaneously, electron and ion temperature enhancements with corresponding density increase from soft precipitation are also observed by the EISCAT Svalbard Radar. The ground magnetometers also detected electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves at the approximate time of the TCV arrival. This implies that they were generated by a temperature anisotropy resulting from a compression on the dayside magnetosphere. SCANDI data show a divergence in thermospheric winds during the TCVs, presumably due to thermospheric heating associated with the current closure linked to a field-aligned current system generated by the TCVs. We conclude that solar wind pressure impulse-related transient phenomena can affect even the upper atmospheric dynamics via current systems established by a magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling process.",

The OSSEs are performed using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere-ionosphere eXtension (WACCMX) with data assimilation provided by the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman filter. Results from the OSSEs demonstrate that the assimilation of ionosphere observations improves the short-term (1 hr) forecasts and analyses. The OSSEs show that the short-term forecasts and analyses are further improved when the ionosphere observations adjust the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature in addition to the ionosphere electron density. Based on an initialized forecast experiment, we find that adjusting the thermosphere neutral composition and temperature also leads to improved forecast skill in the ionosphere on longer time scales (i.e., beyond 1 hr). Additionally, it is shown that using a 1 hr data assimilation cycle, and removal of second-order divergence damping in WACCMX+DART significantly improves tidal amplitudes, which were previously found to be too small. These initial results represent the first whole atmosphere data assimilation system with capabilities to assimilate observations from the troposphere to the ionosphere-thermosphere.",

Taking advantage of multiinstrument magnetic field and plasma data collected by the four spacecraft of the Cluster constellation as they traversed the northern plasma sheet boundary layer in the magnetotail on 14 September 2004, we identified the species type and energy range of the FAC carriers for the first time. The results indicate that part of tailward FACs is carried by energetic keV ions, which are probably originated from the ionosphere through outflow, and they are not too small (~2 nA/m<SUP>2</SUP>) to be ignored. The earthward (tailward) FACs are mainly carried by the dominant tailward (earthward) motion of electrons, and higher-energy electrons (from ~0.5 to 26 keV) are the main carriers.",

Using two-dimensional global hybrid simulations, we investigate the formation and evolution of HSJs with different solar wind conditions. When the quasi-parallel shock is formed, HSJs begin to appear in the quasi-parallel magnetosheath. Some elongated HSJs formed at the quasi-parallel bow shock extend toward the quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath along with the background magnetosheath flow. As the elongated HSJs moves in the magnetosheath, filamentary structures of the velocity, ion density, and temperature occur in the magnetosheath. The filamentary structures are the traces of HSJs moving in the magnetosheath. Moreover, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can be excited at HSJs, which causes meandering of HSJs. When the interplanetary magnetic field is aligned to the solar wind velocity, the large-scale HSJs with a parallel (perpendicular) scale size of about 2.5 R<SUB>E</SUB> (0.3 R<SUB>E</SUB>) are formed at the magnetosheath where the \u03b8<SUB>Bn</SUB> is approaching zero. Then, some HSJs converge, leading to the formation of even larger HSJs with a parallel (perpendicular) scale size of 5 R<SUB>E</SUB> (0.6 R<SUB>E</SUB>).",

         "abstract": "The substorm onset process was studied on the basis of the vertical evolution of auroral acceleration regions derived from auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) spectra and Pi pulsations on the ground. The field-aligned auroral acceleration at substorm onset demonstrated two distinct phases. Low-altitude acceleration (h~3000-5000 km), which accompanied auroral initial brightening, prebreakup Pi2, and direct current of ultralow frequency (DC-ULF) pulsation were first activated and played an important role (precondition) in the subsequent substorm expansion phase onset. Prebreakup Pi2 is suggestive of the ballooning mode wave generation, and negative decrease in DC-ULF suggests increasing field-aligned current (FAC). We called this stage the substorm initial phase. A few minutes after this initial phase onset, high-altitude acceleration, which accompanied auroral breakup and poleward expansion with breakup Pi1 and Pi2 pulsations, suddenly broke out in an altitude range from 8000 to 16,000 km. Thus, substorm expansion onset originated in the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling region, i.e., substorm ignition in the M-I coupling region. Statistical investigations revealed that about 65% of earthward flow bursts observed in the plasma sheet were accompanied by enhanced low-altitude AKR, suggesting that flow braking of bursts causes FAC and resulting low-altitude field-aligned acceleration in the M-I coupling region. On the basis of these observations, we propose a substorm onset scenario in which FAC that originated from the braking of plasma flow bursts first enhances low-altitude acceleration (substorm initial phase onset) and then the increasing FAC induces current-driven instability in the M-I coupling region, which leads to high-altitude acceleration and resulting substorm expansion phase onset.",

         "abstract": "We examined a fortuitous case of an omega band pulsating aurora observed simultaneously on the ground at Sanikiluaq in Canada and onboard the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorm (THEMIS) spacecraft on 1 March 2011. We observed almost the entire process of the generation of the omega band aurora from the initial growth to the declining through expansion period. The omega band aurora grew from a faint seed, not via distortion of a preexisting east-west band aurora. The size scale of the omega band aurora during the maximum period was ~500 km in the north-south direction and ~200 km in the east-west direction. The mesoscale omega band aurora consisted of more than 15 patches of complex-shaped small-scale auroras. Each patch contained an intense pulsating aurora with a recurrent period of ~9-12 s and a poleward moving form. The footprints of the THEMIS D and THEMIS E spacecraft crossed the poleward part of the omega band aurora. THEMIS D observed significant signatures in the electromagnetic fields and particles associated with the time at which the spacecraft crossed the omega band aurora. In particular, it was found that the Y and Z components of the DC electric field intensity, especially the Z component, modulated with almost the same period as that of the optical pulsating auroras. The electrostatic low-frequency waves of less than 30 Hz showed quasiperiodic intensity variations similar to those of the DC electric field. These observations suggest that DC electric field variation and low-frequency electrostatic waves may play important roles in the driving mechanism of omega band pulsating auroras.",

         "abstract": "In this study, we examine a large number of plasma structures (filaments), observed with the Cluster spacecraft during 2 years (2007-2008) in the dayside magnetosphere but consisting of magnetosheath plasma. To reduce the effects observed in the cusp regions and on magnetosphere flanks, we consider these events predominantly inside the narrow cone \u226430\u00b0 about the subsolar point. Two important features of these filaments are (i) their stable antisunward (earthward) motion inside the magnetosphere, whereas the ambient magnetospheric plasma moves usually in the opposite direction (sunward), and (ii) between these filaments and the magnetopause, there is a region of magnetospheric plasma, which separates these filaments from the magnetosheath. The stable earthward motion of these filaments and the presence of a region of magnetospheric plasma between these filaments and the magnetopause show the possible disconnection of these filaments from the magnetosheath, as suggested earlier by many researchers. The results also show that these events cannot be a result of back-and-forth motions of magnetopause position or surface waves propagating on the magnetopause. Another important feature of these filaments is their rotation about the filament axis, which might be a result of their passage through the velocity shear on magnetopause boundary. After crossing the velocity shear, the filaments get a rotational velocity, which has opposite directions in the noon-dusk and noon-dawn sectors. This rotation velocity may be an important factor, supporting the stability of these filaments and providing their motion into the magnetosphere.",

We refer to such layers as \"embedded\" R1 and R2 FACs. Likely resulting from enhanced magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) convection, these FACs may indicate M-I configuration change and contribute significantly to substorm current wedges. We present several events in which embedded FACs were observed by low-altitude spacecraft in the ionosphere. All the events occurred during active geomagnetic conditions or a substorm growth phase, and most map to an equatorial location on the nightside. When an embedded FAC is upward, it coincides with inverted-V electron precipitation and a discrete auroral arc. If an upward embedded FAC is in the postmidnight-to-dawn sector, a dawnside auroral polarization stream appears immediately poleward of it, so it may be important for ionospheric heating, M-I convection, and instabilities. Our results establish embedded FACs as a frequently appearing, fundamental phenomenon for understanding and modeling the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

These primary electrons with energies in the kiloelectron volt range, simultaneously precipitating in magnetically conjugate regions, produce the secondary electron population and can be reflected by the atmosphere back through the magnetosphere and precipitate into the conjugate region with additional follow-up atmospheric backscatter. Primary, degraded, and secondary electrons can be trapped back into the magnetosphere as they travel back and forth between the two magnetically conjugate ionospheres and continuously delivering their energy to the cold plasma sheet electrons and form the electron thermal fluxes that deposit this energy at the upper ionospheric altitudes. We consider the formation of these heat fluxes focusing on the magnetosphere-ionosphere energy interplay of the entire superthermal electron spectra from 1 eV up to 10 keV and discuss the efficiency of the different spectral energy intervals that contribute to the electron plasma heating at the magnetospheric altitudes. Our parametric studies at L = 6.8, with lower and upper band chorus whistler wave amplitudes of 10 pT and electron cyclotron harmonic wave amplitudes of 1 mVm<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicate the dominant role of the whistler mode in the formation of the electron heat flux coming from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) observations over a 10-year period from 2008 to 2017, we statistically investigate the thermodynamic properties for magnetosheath ions and their dependence on upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The thermodynamic properties for magnetosheath ions are estimated by using the polytropic index averaged over the subinterval that belongs to the same streamline (\u03b1&gt;\u00af). The THEMIS observations show that the probability distribution of \u03b1&gt;\u00af for magnetosheath ions has a major peak at \u03b1&gt;\u00af 1 (quasi-isothermal conditions) with a longer left tail down to \u03b1&gt;\u00af 0 (quasi-isobaric conditions). The spatial distributions of \u03b1&gt;\u00af for two different types according to IMF spiral angle (i.e., Parker spiral and ortho-Parker spiral IMF orientations) reveal that the ions in the downstream of a quasi-perpendicular shock (quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath) exhibit quasi-isothermal processes, while those in the downstream of a quasi-parallel shock (quasi-parallel magnetosheath) show \u03b1&gt;\u00af lower than unity (down to \u03b1&gt;\u00af 0.8) implying the anticorrelation between the ion temperature and the ion number density variations. Moreover, \u03b1&gt;\u00af in the quasi-parallel magnetosheath tends to decrease with increasing magnetic local time distance from the magnetic local noon. These results indicate that the thermodynamic properties for magnetosheath ions depend on the bow shock geometry (quasi-perpendicular bow shocks versus quasi-parallel bow shocks) and are presumably controlled by a variety of instabilities, waves, and turbulence in the magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "We have studied successive substorm expansions that occurred in spite of a period of prolonged northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). After the northward IMF persisted for almost \u223c19 h, a series of 11 very weak to moderate substorm expansions occurred during the following 6-h interval of northward IMF on 19 January 1998, separated from each other by a few tens of minutes. Most of these substorm expansions did not accompany significant changes of the solar wind and the IMF. As for typical substorms that occur under southward IMF conditions, spacecraft and ground-based instruments observed auroral breakups and enhancements of the westward auroral electrojet and large-scale convection in the ionosphere, together with plasmoids and dipolarizations in the magnetotail, in association with the substorm expansion onsets. These signatures suggest that the mechanism of substorm expansion onsets is the same as for typical substorms, even under prolonged northward IMF conditions. We suggest that the large IMF \u2223B<SUB>y</SUB>\u2223 affects large-scale convection and energy accumulation in the magnetotail and that the enhanced convection due to the large IMF \u2223B<SUB>y</SUB>\u2223 effect and substorm expansions can be an important factor for the promotion of succeeding substorm expansion onsets.",

         "abstract": "Throat aurora is defined as south-north aligned auroral arcs equatorward of the dayside cusp aurora and was suggested to be the results of cold magnetospheric plasma interaction with magnetopause reconnection, but its observational properties have not yet been well established. In this paper we carefully examine a sequence of throat auroras observed over Svalbard on 27 December 2003. Observations from 630.0 nm [OI] show that poleward moving throat auroras frequently show brightening followed by dimming in auroral intensity, and sometimes, the brightening throat aurora is a precursor of poleward moving auroral forms. Simultaneous all-sky images and HF radar backscatter observations along geomagnetic meridian show that the throat aurora brightening is drifting with ionospheric E \u00d7 B convection and is colocated with enhanced spectral width poleward of the convection reversal boundary (CRB), while its dimming tends to be in the vicinity of the CRB. This leads us to propose that the throat aurora brightening and dimming may be on the open and closed field lines, respectively. Particle data from NOAA 16 confirm that the dimming throat aurora is associated with precipitation of magnetosheath-like particles mixed with magnetospheric ions (&gt;30 keV), which is characteristic of the low-latitude boundary layer. For particle data from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F16, we notice that the dimming throat aurora is associated with lower fluxes of magnetosheath-like electrons accompanied with magnetospheric electrons, which is most likely on closed field lines. The dynamic properties of throat aurora presented in this paper are thus important to understand its generation mechanisms.",

         "abstract": "It has been debated for many years whether all substorm onsets are triggered by a sudden change in the solar wind. Because there is not a generally accepted definition of external triggers, a solar wind change may be identified to be an external trigger by some investigators but not a trigger by others. In this paper, we study the substorm onset from the magnetospheric state during sawtooth events. We do not try to determine whether a solar wind change around the onset is a trigger. Instead, we examine whether an external trigger from the solar wind is always necessary for substorm onset and why large changes in the solar wind do not always trigger sawtooth (substorm) onset. We have analyzed 54 sawtooth onsets and corresponding changes in the solar wind. The mean value of the total magnetic flux in the magnetotail at the sawtooth onsets is 0.98 GWb. Sawtooth onset can occur when the changes in the solar wind are very small (0.5 nPa in the solar wind dynamic pressure and 1 nT in the IMF B<SUB>z</SUB>). We have also identified a number of large changes in the solar wind without occurrence of sawtooth onset, and the mean value of the magnetotail magnetic flux is 0.74-0.79 GWb. However, the large changes in the solar wind do not cause sawtooth onset when the magnetotail magnetic flux is generally smaller than 0.8 GWb in these cases. The observations suggest that sawtooth onset will occur when the magnetotail magnetic flux is close to a critical value (\u223c1 GWb, depending on the solar wind and geomagnetic activity), no matter whether the corresponding change in the solar wind is large or small. The observations also suggest that no sawtooth (substorm) onset can be triggered by a solar wind change if the magnetotail magnetic flux is \u223c25% lower than the critical value of the onset, no matter how large the change in the solar wind is. Sawtooth onset appears to be an internal magnetospheric instability process, and a large change in the solar wind is not necessary for the occurrence of sawtooth onset.",

During the simulation Titan crosses Saturn's magnetopause twice, exiting and reentering Saturn's magnetosphere. The magnetic field in Saturn's magnetosheath is predominately northward. Once inside Saturn's magnetosheath, Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetosphere is removed by slow ionospheric convection. Evidence for reconnection at Titan is not seen. Inside the magnetosheath the plasma flow is not perpendicular to the magnetic field, and magnetic field lines do not strongly drape around Titan. Titan's ionosphere is extended in the magnetosheath because Titan's ionospheric plasma is not stripped away by convecting magnetic field at high altitudes. After Titan crosses back into Saturn's magnetosphere, the magnetospheric plasma and field removes Titan's extended ionosphere, and Titan's induced magnetosphere returns to a \u201ctypical\u201d configuration. The simulation is used to determine the time scale of Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetic field lines or magnetosheath magnetic field lines after a magnetopause crossing. In the magnetosheath, slow (\u223c3 km/s) ionospheric convection removes Titan's connection to Saturn's magnetosphere in \u223c1.8 h. After Titan crosses back into Saturn's rapidly rotating magnetosphere, Titan's connection to magnetosheath magnetic field lines is removed through ionospheric convection in \u223c50 min. The results of the simulation are also compared to data from Cassini's T32 flyby.",

Cluster is ideally placed to study this region due to the orientation of the orbit in the magnetotail, such that the current sheet is sampled at distances downtail from about 8-19 R<SUB>E</SUB>. Multiple fluctuations of the X component of the magnetic field (B<SUB>X</SUB>) from positive to negative and vice versa, measured by Cluster as it crosses the nominal location of the current sheet, indicate that the current sheet is in motion. In this study we use the number of crossings of the current sheet by the Cluster 3 spacecraft as a measure of the dynamics of the magnetotail. The effects of substorm and magnetic storm activity on the dynamics during these orbits have been investigated using the AE and SYM-H indices. Our results indicate that the current sheet is more often in motion during orbits when there is greater than average substorm activity and a quiet ring current. Results suggest that internal processes within the tail that initiate substorms may also initiate the flapping motion of the current sheet. In addition the more dipolar field that results from an enhanced ring current during magnetic storms may inhibit tail dynamics during substorm events.",

The three cases show discrete stable arcs, substorm aurora, and Alfv\u00e9nic aurora. The field-aligned current structure associated with each type of aurora is shown to agree with contemporary auroral models. Inverted-V type aurora with electron energy peaks of 1-10 keV are observed, and are associated with upward current regions and discrete auroral arcs seen in the all sky imagers. Downward currents are also identified and correlated with regions without visible aurora, and Alfv\u00e9nic electron precipitation is associated with mixed current regions and dynamic aurora evident in the all sky images. The substorm aurora observed also shows upward current regions and inverted-V's associated with bright spots in the ground-based images. The images shown in association with the substorm aurora correlate well with existing substorm models, including that of Akasofu [1964]. In this study we present these new ground and satellite conjunctions and use them to confirm existing theories of auroral acceleration mechanisms. Additionally, we compare the observations to existing substorm models and investigate differences between specific substorms and the various auroral forms associated with them.",

The open flux can be calculated from the area of the polar cap, delineated by the open-closed field line boundary (OCB). This study presents a superposed epoch analysis of the location of the OCB and the change in the magnetic flux content in individual nightside MLT sectors during substorm growth, expansion, and recovery phases. Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the IMAGE satellite are used to derive a proxy of the OCB location. In the hour prior to substorm onset, the total nightside flux content increases by up to 0.12 GWb on average, resulting in an equatorward expansion of the OCB. Following substorm onset, the OCB contracts toward the pole as the open magnetic flux content decreases by up to 0.14 GWb on average, but the rate of decrease of the total nightside open flux content differs by 5-66% between the three IMAGE far ultraviolet instruments. The OCB does not contract poleward uniformly in all nightside magnetic local time (MLT) sectors after substorm onset. Close to the substorm onset MLT sector, the OCB contracts immediately following substorm onset; however, the OCB in more dawnward and duskward MLT sectors continues to expand equatorward for up to 120 minutes after substorm onset. Despite the continued increase in flux in these sectors after substorm onset, the total nightside flux content decreases immediately at substorm onset, indicating that the nightside reconnection rate exceeds the dayside rate following substorm onset.",

We found that the onset was preceded sequentially by enhanced polar cap flows heading equatorward near the polar cap boundary, and then by tail fast flows from the mid-tail to the near-Earth region. We also observed in situ fluctuations in short-period Pi2 band (\u223c30-50 s) in both the magnetic field and plasma pressure during the initial couple of min of the fast flows, occurring nearly simultaneously with the dipolarization and the fast flows and propagating earthward. Our results suggest that these fluctuations may be triggered by the fast flows, and may play an important role in the substorm onset process. Our event suggests that localized tail reconnection may be triggered by the enhanced polar cap flows, though the reconnection location cannot be unambiguously determined. Earthward fast flows are generated as a result of the tail reconnection and reach the inner magnetosphere to initiate the substorm onset. The presented case is consistent with that predicted by the Nishimura et al. (2010a) scenario.",

Inner magnetospheric plasma undergoes self-consistent interactions with global electric and magnetic fields. Waves excited in the inner magnetosphere from unstable particle distributions can provide energy exchange between different particle populations in the inner magnetosphere and affect the ring current and radiation belt dynamics. The ionosphere serves as an energy sink and feeds the magnetosphere back through the cold plasma outflow. The precipitating inner magnetospheric particles influence the ionosphere and upper atmospheric chemistry and affect climate. Satellite measurements and theoretical studies have advanced our understanding of the dynamics of various plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere. However, our knowledge of the coupling processes among the plasmasphere, ring current, radiation belts, global magnetic and electric fields, and plasma waves generated within these systems is still incomplete. This special issue incorporates extended papers presented at the Inner Magnetosphere Coupling III conference held 23-27 March 2015 in Los Angeles, California, USA, and includes modeling and observational contributions addressing interactions within different plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere (plasmasphere, ring current, and radiation belts), coupling between fields and plasma populations, as well as effects of the inner magnetosphere on the ionosphere and atmosphere.",

The CHAMP spacecraft revealed large variability in cusp thermosphere densities, measuring frequent satellite drag enhancements, up to doublings. The community recognizes a clear need for more realistic representation of plasma flows and electron densities near the cusp. Existing average value models produce order of magnitude errors in these parameters, resulting in large underestimations of predicted drag. We fill this knowledge gap with statistics-based specification of these key parameters over their range of observed values. The European Incoherent Scatter Svalbard Radar tracks plasma flow V<SUB>i</SUB>, electron density N<SUB>e</SUB>, and electron, ion temperatures T<SUB>e</SUB>, T<SUB>i</SUB>, with consecutive 2-3 min windshield wipe scans of 1000 \u00d7 500 km areas. This allows mapping the maximum T<SUB>i</SUB> of a large area within or near the cusp with high temporal resolution. In magnetic field-aligned mode the radar can measure high-resolution profiles of these plasma parameters. By deriving statistics for N<SUB>e</SUB> and T<SUB>i</SUB>, we enable derivation of thermosphere heating deposition under background and frictional drag-dominated magnetic reconnection conditions. We separate our N<SUB>e</SUB> and T<SUB>i</SUB> profiles into quiescent and enhanced states, which are not closely correlated due to the spatial structure of the reconnection foot point. Use of our data-based parameter inputs can make order of magnitude corrections to input data driving thermosphere models, enabling removal of previous twofold drag errors.",

         "abstract": "In order to correctly describe the dynamical behavior of the magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling system and the scale-dependent auroral process, we develop a synthesis formulation that combines the process of (1) the inverse Walen separation of MHD disturbance into parallel- and antiparallel-propagating shear Alfv\u00e9n wave to the ambient magnetic field, (2) the shear Alfv\u00e9n wave reflection process including (3) the scale-dependent electrostatic coupling process through the linearized Knight relation, (4) two-layer ionosphere model, and (5) dynamic conductance variations. A novel procedure that applies the inverse Walen relation to the incompressional MHD disturbances at the inner boundary of the MHD region enables to extract the component of the shear Alfv\u00e9n wave incident to the ionosphere. The extracted incident electric field supplies an electromotive force for the generation of the MI coupling system, and the reflected electric field is generated such that it totally satisfies the synthesis MI-coupling equation. A three-dimensional ionospheric current system is represented by a two-layer model in which the Pedersen and the Hall current are confined in the separated layers, which are connected by field-aligned currents driven by the linear current-voltage relation between two layers. Hence, our scheme possibly reproduces two types of the scale-dependent MI-decoupling process of the perpendicular potential structure: due to the parallel potential drop at the auroral acceleration region and the other due to the parallel potential differences inside the ionosphere. Our newly formulation may be well suited for description of scale-dependent auroral process and mesoscale ionospheric electrodynamics interlocked with the dynamical development of magnetospheric processes.",

         "abstract": "Previous studies of auroral behaviors have suggested that the substorm expansion is a result of a chain of processes originating in the magnetotail. We present a detailed study on the substorm expansion behavior on 3 November 1998, using the global auroral images from Polar and the conjugate central plasma sheet data from Geotail in the near-Earth tail. The closer inspection of the auroral data enables us to characterize the stepwise feature of the auroral evolution, which were found to be spatially and temporally separable into two intense auroral activities: the initial brightening of the substorm arc and the second aurora that took place eastward of the first one with the time delay of 4.5 min. Comparing the near-Earth tail observation of the fast plasma flow, we show that the observed time lag of 4.5 min can be explained by a systematic chain of plasma processes in the central plasma sheet, indicating that this time delay can be interpreted as a generic behavior. The generality of the stepwise evolution within the expected time lag of 2-6 min is also pursued, and is found for three out of six substorms. With respect to the stepwise feature, our observation of six substorms suggests that there are at least three types of substorm expansion dynamics that are attributable to different chains of tail processes.",

In an advance on the analysis undertaken by Clilverd et al. (2008), we use phase observations of VLF radio wave signals to describe substorm-driven EEP characteristics more accurately than before. Using a &gt;30 keV electron precipitation flux of 5.6 \u00d7 10<SUP>7</SUP> el. cm<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> and a spectral gradient consistent with that observed by THEMIS, it was possible to accurately reproduce the peak observed riometer absorption at Macquarie Island (L = 5.4) and the associated NWC radio wave phase change observed at Casey, Antarctica, during the second, larger substorm. The flux levels were near to 80% of the peak fluxes observed in a similar substorm as studied by Clilverd et al. (2008). During the initial stages of the second substorm, a latitude region of 5 &lt; L &lt; 9 was affected by electron precipitation. Both substorms showed expansion of the precipitation region to 4 &lt; L &lt; 12 more than 30 min after the injection. While both substorms occurred at similar local times, with electron precipitation injections into approximately the same geographical region, the second expanded in an eastward longitude more slowly, suggesting the involvement of lower-energy electron precipitation. Each substorm region expanded westward at a rate slower than that exhibited eastward. This study shows that it is possible to successfully combine these multi-instrument observations to investigate the characteristics of substorms.",

         "abstract": "Alfv\u00e9nic arcs are often found adjacent to the poleward border of the substorm bulge. They are created by precipitating narrow electron beams with a broad energy distribution, mainly below 1 keV, and dominated by Alfv\u00e9nic structures of small scales and frequencies in the 1 Hz range. They are also associated with transverse ion heating. A balanced field-aligned current system accompanying the poleward Alfv\u00e9nic arc reveals its underlying structure being a broad channel of primary energy inflow of several tens of kilometers width. The associated magnetic shear stresses drive a flow along the poleward side of the substorm current wedge. Polar cap convection passes through this channel before entering the substorm bulge. The small-scale electromagnetic structures are developing from the primary energy inflow by scale breaking and multiple reflections in the ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator. By their parallel electric field components these structures decouple effectively from the ionosphere. Their energy content is converted into kinetic energy of auroral particles in the topside ionosphere. A selected data set from FAST, DE 2, and Cluster is presented for characterizing the energetic and electromagnetic properties of the Alfv\u00e9nic arc. Its function in the substorm can be summarized as a preconditioning of the polar cap plasma and magnetic field for entry into the magnetosphere through the poleward arc. This occurs under substantial density depletion.",

This study uses the midlatitude positive bay index to identify substorms. A case study investigates the magnetospheric and ionospheric responses to substorm onset related fast flows and nonsubstorm fast flows using observations from the THEMIS spacecraft and ionospheric currents. Statistics based on THEMIS observations made over 11 years show that substorm onset related fast flows are more likely to penetrate closer to the Earth and spread over a wider range of MLTs compared to nonsubstorm fast flows. The substorm onset related fast flow durations are slightly longer than nonsubstorm fast flow on average, and there is no significant difference between their peak velocity probability distributions. However, substorm onset related fast flows are statistically shown to be accompanied by substantially larger B<SUB>z</SUB> increases that persist for longer periods of time, and hence result in 80% larger earthward directed magnetic flux transport rates.",

         "abstract": "To understand the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) disturbances, it is necessary to know the change in the null-separator structure along with the development of convection. The present paper explains this proposition by taking the case of the theta aurora that occurs after the switch of interplanetary magnetic field By and reveals auroral development inside the polar cap. The interplanetary magnetic field change is followed by the reformation of the null-separator structure to cause a convection transient and a successive deformation of separatrices inside the magnetosphere, where separatrices separate the space into different volumes that include different types of magnetic field lines, and intersections of separatrices form separators that connect nulls. By the reconnection on the separator, energy inflow occurs from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. Convection driven by this energy transports nulls. In the case of theta aurora, two new nulls on the dayside coexist with two old nulls carried toward the tail by convection. Each set of nulls generates two open-closed boundaries (separatrices) bounded by separators. Thus, open-closed boundaries are divide into four parts. Separatrices generated by different sets partially become side by side near the nightside stem limes. The theta aurora is generated at the area corresponding to the low-latitude side with respect to both of two boundaries. Thus, the occurrence of the theta aurora is a natural consequence of a transition in the null-separator structure. The present example indicates that the global structure of the magnetosphere is almost decided from the skeleton of nulls.",

         "abstract": "About 40 years after the discovery of the substorm, auroral observations were used to propose that substorm onset was triggered in the inner plasmas sheet (equatorward portion of the auroral oval) by an intrusion of the low entropy plasma by plasma sheet flow channels. Longitudinal localization makes such flow channels difficult to observe with sparse spacecraft, but they can be seen in the ionosphere via the broader, two dimensional coverage by ground based radars. We have analyzed all eight substorm auroral onset events with appropriate auroral and Poker Flat radar viewing during a radar campaign. These, together with five previously analyzed events provide evidence that intruding flow channels play an important role in substorm onsets. That the flux tube integrated entropy of this new plasma must be lower than that of the surrounding plasma implies that the change in the entropy distribution within the plasma sheet gives rises to the substorm onset instability that is seen via the growing auroral and electromagnetic waves seen with substorm auroral onset. Our analysis also adds to previous evidence that the flow channels leading to onset move into the plasma sheet/auroral oval from the open polar cap region of the magnetotail lobes/polar caps, that these flow channels move across the polar cap following their origin near the dayside boundary of the polar cap, and that substantial ground magnetic depressions associated with substorm do not occur with substorm onset but instead occur a few to several minutes later in association with expansion phase streamers.",

In the standalone RCM, inputs are typically taken from empirical models or inferred from satellite data; however, in this simulation, the OpenGGCM magnetic field and plasma information are used to supply inputs and boundary conditions for the RCM. The OpenGGCM ionospheric potential is used to drive a RCM run. That simulation is used to investigate the short time scale dynamics that occurred around substorm onset and assumes the OpenGGCM has a realistic representation of the inner magnetospheric magnetic field during this event. In these runs, a channel of low total entropy plasma opened up on the RCM tailward boundary around substorm onset, and plasma bubbles were injected into the inner magnetosphere. These bubbles were produced by nonadiabatic processes in the OpenGGCM such as magnetic reconnection. We compare the RCM energetic particle flux with measurements from two Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellites. A dispersionless electron injection is reproduced at the LANL-89 location and a dispersed flux increase at the LANL-97A location. The results indicate the low-PV<SUP>5/3</SUP> plasma accompanying magnetic field dipolarization produced earthward plasma motion as the result of these low-entropy flux tubes interchanging their way into the inner magnetosphere; this process may play an important role in substorm particle injection. A comparison simulation in which the electric field is solved by the RCM is also presented, suggesting the need to use RCM's electric field for more accurate inner magnetosphere modeling.",

         "abstract": "The temporal and spatial evolution of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves during the magnetic storm of 21-29 June 2015 was investigated using high-resolution magnetic field observations from Swarm constellation in the ionosphere and Van Allen Probes in the magnetosphere. Magnetospheric EMIC waves had a maximum occurrence frequency in the afternoon sector and shifted equatorward during the expansion phase and poleward during the recovery phase. However, ionospheric waves in subauroral regions occurred more frequently in the nighttime than during the day and exhibited less obvious latitudinal movements. During the main phase, dayside EMIC waves occurred in both the ionosphere and magnetosphere in response to the dramatic increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure. Waves were absent in the magnetosphere and ionosphere around the minimum SYM-H. During the early recovery phase, He<SUP>+</SUP> band EMIC waves were observed in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. During the late recovery phase, H<SUP>+</SUP> band EMIC waves emerged in response to enhanced earthward convection during substorms in the premidnight sector. The occurrence of EMIC waves in the noon sector was affected by the intensity of substorm activity. Both ionospheric wave frequency and power were higher in the summer hemisphere than in the winter hemisphere. Waves were confined to an MLT interval of less than 5 hr with a duration of less than 186 min from coordinated observations. The results could provide additional insights into the spatial characteristics and propagation features of EMIC waves during storm periods.",

         "abstract": "This study proposes a new formula that describes a dynamical magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling system through the field-aligned current (FAC) closure and electrostatic potential connectivity. In the past, MI coupling processes were described as either \u201cinductive\u201d or \u201cstatic.\u201d The inductive coupling scheme is based on the reflection of MHD waves at the ionosphere, whereas in the static coupling scheme the electrostatic potential is determined through the FAC closure. In contrast, in our new formulation these two schemes are combined by the \u201cAlfvenic-coupling\u201d algorithm. The concept of the Alfvenic coupling is as follows. When a distribution of ionospheric current is changed from the background condition through the mapping of magnetospheric disturbances and/or by the change of ionospheric conductivity, an ionospheric reflection electric filed is instantaneously generated to satisfy the current continuity condition. The electrostatic potential of this reflection field also feeds back to the magnetosphere and excites shear Alfvenic disturbances in the magnetosphere. Therefore, the current continuity condition has to include the FAC of Alfvenic disturbances. In this sense, the reflection potential is not only a modification of the ionospheric potential but also a source of inductive Alfvenic disturbances. Quantitative estimation of feedback components to the magnetosphere reveals that our new formulation is more suitable to global MI simulations than the static MI coupling, which has been the only scheme used in the past.",

We show, for the first time, close connection between the dayside and nightside polar cap flow enhancements (with the enhanced dayside flow preceding the nightside one by several minutes) and the ensuing poleward boundary intensification (PBI)/streamer, and the later onset, forming a complete preonset sequence for a substorm onset. Our results supplement our previous study by providing further evidence that the dayside polar cap flow disturbance may be the key to initiate the whole process of a certain type of substorm by triggering reconnection somewhere in the tail via applied field (or flow) perturbations on the nightside plasma sheet boundary layer. Our results also indicate that a preexisting double oval structure is likely a favorable precondition for a certain type of substorm to be triggered by polar cap flow disturbance and the associated PBIs/streamers. On the other hand, not all our global-scale preonset auroral sequences support the recent revised onset scenario proposed by Nishimura et al. (k href=\"#jgra51071-bib-0022\"/&gt;) using the all-sky imagers of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission. This suggests that the preceding PBI/streamer is not a sufficient condition to trigger a substorm. It may not even be a necessary condition considering the existence of various types of substorm onsets.",

Simultaneous observations of the plasmasphere and ionosphere are vital to understand the coupling between the two regions. In this study, using the measurements from the newly developed Chinese ground-based space weather monitoring network (Meridian Project), we investigate the plasmaspheric density at L \u2243 2 inferred from ground magnetometers and the ionospheric electron density inferred by digital ionosondes and GPS signals during magnetic storms in 2011. Five moderate magnetic storms with minimum D<SUB>st</SUB> index between -47 and -103 nT during this period have been investigated. The observations show that the plasmaspheric density drops significantly by more than half of the prestorm value. The ionospheric F2 layer electron density NmF2 and the total electron content (TEC) show ~20-50% decreases, and the NmF2 and TEC reductions take place before the plasmaspheric density reaches its minimum. These findings suggest that the plasmaspheric depletion is very likely due to the reduced plasma supply from the ionosphere for the five moderate magnetic storms in 2011. Therefore, the plasmasphere dynamics seems to be controlled by the ionosphere during magnetic storms.",

However, it is not clear how the ionosphere and thermosphere (IT) system responds to Alfv\u00e9nic quasi-periodic oscillating IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> conditions. In this article, simulations by the Coupled Magnetosphere Ionosphere Thermosphere model have been used to investigate the effects of IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> temporal variations with 10-, 30-, and 60-min oscillation periods on the coupled IT system. The simulation results show that the cross polar cap potential and auroral peak electron energy flux are stronger when the IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillation frequency is lower. The relatively small periodic wind responses in the 10-min IMF oscillation case indicates a low-pass filter nature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. Two different thermospheric wind (Vn) responses are revealed. One is the almost simultaneous responses at all latitudes, and the other shows a typical traveling atmospheric disturbances signature with a time delay with respect to the latitude for all UTs. The simultaneous Vn responses at all latitudes appear in the daytime Northern Hemisphere, which are mainly caused by the ion drag force in association with penetration electric fields induced plasma density and ion drifts changes. The short-period traveling atmospheric disturbances occurring in the nighttime of both hemispheres and the daytime of the Southern Hemisphere propagate from high to low latitudes showing latitudinal dependence. Both responses oscillate with the same frequencies as those of IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> oscillations.",

On the other hand, there is a broad range of observations, including magnetometers, aurora imagers, and radars, in the ionosphere. Since the nightside ionosphere resembles the magnetotail plasma sheet dynamics projection, it can be used to monitor the tail's dynamics. A proper interpretation of the ionosphere and ground observations necessitates understanding the coupling processes between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. Here, we use the global magnetohydrodynamic simulation model, OpenGGCM-CTIM-RCM, to investigate these coupling processes during periods when the magnetic flux is transported through the tail via narrow fast flow channels, typically called bursty bulk flows (BBFs). We consider three relevant states of the magnetotail: immediately before the substorm's onset, during the expansion of the substorm, and during a steady magnetic convection (SMC) event. The number of flow channels increases, and they penetrate closer to the Earth during SMC. The IMF B<SUB>y</SUB> direction influences fast flows' location but not their orientation in the plasma sheet during this event. However, the dimension of fast flows and streamers do not depend on the IMF conditions and state of the magnetosphere.",

We developed a plasma-chemical model to compute the vibrational kinetics induced by a sprite streamer in the 40- to 70-km altitude range until several tens of seconds after the visible flash is over. Then, we computed the consecutive time-dependent thermal infrared spectra that could be observed from the stratosphere (from a balloon platform), high troposphere (from an aircraft), and low troposphere (aircraft or altitude observatory) using a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer model. Our simulations predict a strong production of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the (001) vibrational level which lasts at least 40 s before falling to background concentrations. This leads to enhanced emissions in the long-wavelength infrared, around 1,000 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, and midwavelength infrared, around 2,300 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The maximum sprite infrared signatures (sprite spectra minus background spectra) reach several 10<SUP>-7</SUP> W/sr/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/cm<SUP>-1</SUP> after propagation through the mesosphere and stratosphere, to an observer located at 20-40 km of altitude. This maximum signal is about 1 order of magnitude lower if propagated until the troposphere.

In order to understand the large-scale dynamic processes in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system due to the compression from the solar wind, the 17 March 2015 sudden commencement was studied in detail using global numerical models. This storm was one of the most geoeffective events of the solar cycle 24 with a minimum Dst of -222 nT. The Wind spacecraft recorded a 10-nPa increment in the solar wind dynamic pressure, while the interplanetary magnetic field B<SUB>Z</SUB> became further northward. The University of Michigan Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar wind Roe-type Upwind Scheme global magnetohydrodynamic code was utilized to study the generation and propagation of perturbations associated with the compression of the magnetosphere system. In addition, the high-resolution electric potential and auroral power output from the magnetohydrodynamic model was used to drive the global ionosphere-thermosphere model to investigate the ionosphere-thermosphere system response to pressure enhancement. During the compression, the electric potentials and convection patterns in the polar ionosphere were significantly altered when the preliminary impulse and main impulse field-aligned currents moved from dayside to nightside. As a result of enhanced frictional heating, plasma and neutral temperatures increased at the locations where the flow speeds were enhanced, whereas the electron density dropped at these locations. In particular, the region between the preliminary impulse and main impulse field-aligned currents experienced the most significant heating with 1000-K ion temperature increase and 20-K neutral temperature increase within 2 min. Comparison of the simulation results with the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar observations showed reasonable agreements despite underestimated magnitudes.",

Therefore, a strong field reversal region occurs in the magnetotail, which is prone to the magnetic reconnection. Since the Venus magnetotail is formed due to the solar wind interaction with the ionosphere and the ionosphere is modulated by the solar activity, it is interesting to study the solar cycle dependence of the induced magnetosphere. Here we statistically examine the Venus Express magnetotail data during solar maximum. We find that the magnetic field configuration asymmetry in Venus magnetotail is very much similar to that during solar minimum. The hemispheric asymmetry in the magnetotail persists through the whole solar cycle and magnetic reconnection in the near-Venusian magnetotail might occur during solar minimum as well as solar maximum conditions.",

         "abstract": "Morphological behavior of black aurora as it relates to pulsating aurora is investigated by examining a collection of ground-based observations from January 2007 in support of the Rocket Observations of Pulsating Aurora rocket campaign. Images were sampled from video recorded by a Xybion intensified camera (30 fps) at Poker Flat Research Range, AK. The primary observations of black aurora recorded during the substorm recovery phase were between separate patches of pulsating aurora as well as pulsating aurora separated from diffuse aurora. In these observations the black aurora forms an apparent firm boundary between the auroral forms in a new behavior that is in contrast with previously reported observations. Also presented for the first time are black curls in conjunction with pulsating aurora. Curl structures that indicate shear plasma flows in the ionosphere may be used as a proxy for converging/diverging electric fields in and above the ionosphere. This new subset of black auroral behavior may provide visual evidence of black aurora as an ionospheric feedback mechanism as related to pulsating aurora.",

We track the vertical dynamical, diffusive, and chemical fluxes of O and O<SUB>2</SUB> in and out of two control volumes between \u223c80 and 130 km using a finite volume approach to the individual species continuity equation to investigate their relative importance on the global T I SAO. TIME GCM results indicate that the global T I SAO amplitude and phase is fairly insensitive to significant changes in odd oxygen chemical reaction rates in the MLT. While chemistry has an appreciable effect on O in the MLT region, sensitivity to changes in odd oxygen and odd hydrogen chemical rates appear to be offset by a consequent adjustment in the vertical bulk wind and eddy diffusive transport of O locally, rendering their effects inconsequential to the global T I SAO aloft. The implications of our findings for reproducing a self consistent global T I SAO in the NCAR thermosphere ionosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIE GCM) with a lower boundary near \u223c100 km are discussed. Specifically, including latitude season variations in O, O<SUB>2</SUB>, and N<SUB>2</SUB> from NRLMSIS\u00ae 2.0 at the lower boundary of the TIE GCM near \u223c100 km improves its representation of the climatological T I SAO. However, reformulating the TIE GCM temperature lower boundary condition could further improve its ability to simulate the T I SAO from first principles.",

Taking into account magnetospheric substorm evolution of plasma energy accumulation and release, the largest wind amplitude at the recovery phase is a fascinating result. The results are the first detailed investigation of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupled system at the substorm recovery phase using comprehensive data sets of solar wind, geomagnetic field, auroral pattern, and FPI-derived wind. This study used three events in November 2010 and January 2012, particularly focusing on the wind signatures associated with the auroral morphology, and found three specific features: (1) wind fluctuations that were isolated at the edge and/or in the darker area of an auroral patch with the largest vertical amplitude up to about 20 m/s and with the longest oscillation period about 10 min, (2) when the convection electric field was smaller than 15 mV/m, and (3) wind fluctuations that were accompanied by pulsating aurora. This approach suggests that the energy dissipation to produce the wind fluctuations is localized in the auroral pattern. Effects of the altitudinal variation in the volume emission rate were investigated to evaluate the instrumental artifact due to vertical wind shear. The small electric field values suggest weak contributions of the Joule heating and Lorentz force processes in wind fluctuations. Other unknown mechanisms may play a principal role at the recovery phase.",

Here we address fundamental questions on the large-scale magnetosheath flow around Saturn using a 3-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. We find Saturn's polar-flattened magnetosphere to channel 20% more flow over the poles than around the flanks at the terminator. Further, we decompose the MHD forces responsible for accelerating the magnetosheath plasma to find the plasma pressure gradient as the dominant driver. This is by virtue of a high-\u03b2 magnetosheath and, in turn, the high-M<SUB>A</SUB> bow shock. Together with long-term magnetosheath data by the Cassini spacecraft, we present evidence of how nonaxisymmetry substantially alters the conditions further downstream at the magnetopause, crucial for understanding solar wind-magnetosphere interactions such as reconnection and shear flow-driven instabilities. We anticipate our results to provide a more accurate insight into the global conditions upstream of Saturn and the outer planets.",

The observation covers four seasons, four sunspot cycle phases, annual, and 11 year sunspot cycle (SC) variations of the SCs 20-22 spanning 1966-1998 and a first attempt of such study. The annual mean peak magnitudes of V<SUB>d</SUB> during the prereversal enhancement (PRE) and minimum reversal periods exhibit the 11 year sunspot cycle evolution with the sunspot number (Rz). The PRE peak/Rz and reversal peak/Rz relationships are 98.7% and 84.8%, respectively. PRE peak in June solstice appears 1 h later than for other seasons and is attributed to a decrease in the equatorial zonal wind/conductivity gradient. The highest PRE magnitude and downward perturbation drifts near dusk appear during the equinoxes and lowest in June solstice for all cycles. There is semiannual asymmetry in the variation of V<SUB>d</SUB> during all cycles of the PRE event with peaks in March and September/October. A remarkable feature is the consistent local presunrise drift enhancement for two SCs 20 and 21, which is not a regular feature of the equatorial ionosphere. The rate of inhibition of scintillation effect increases with decreasing phase of sunspot activity and maximizes during the solstices. Both the PRE and minimum reversal peak magnitudes are influenced by the phase of sunspot cycle. Ouagadougou data in this study had shown reliable drift characteristics and can be integrated into the African regional empirical drift model.",

In several cases the magnetic field lines threading the satellites when mapped to the atmosphere were inside the imagers' field of view. From the THEMIS magnetic field and the plasma density measurements, we were able to locate the position of the magnetopause crossings and map it to the ionosphere using the Tsyganenko-96 field model. Field line mapping is reasonably accurate on the dayside subsolar region where the field is strong, almost dipolar even though compressed. From these coordinated observations, we were able to prove that the dayside cusp aurora of high 630 nm brightness is on open field lines, and it is therefore direct precipitation from the magnetosheath. The cusp aurora contained significant highly structured N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> 427.8 nm emission. The THEMIS measurements of the magnetosheath particle energy and density taken just outside the magnetopause compared to the intensity of the structured N<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> 427.8 nm emissions showed that the precipitating magnetosheath particles had to be accelerated. The most likely electron acceleration mechanism is by dispersive Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating along the field line. Wave-accelerated suprathermal electrons were seen by FAST and DMSP. The 427.8 nm wavelength channel also shows the presence of a lower latitude hard-electron precipitation zone originating inside the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "This statistical study examines the solar wind dependence of total electron content (TEC) variations arising from mesoscale (tens to hundreds of kilometers) structuring of the polar cap ionosphere. Six years of TEC measurements were collected from five high-data rate Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers of the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN), from which high-resolution magnetic local time-latitude maps of TEC variation occurrence rate and amplitude were created. Ionosonde radars were used to identify TEC variations arising from ionization of the E and F region ionospheres. Statistical TEC maps were examined as a function of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) measurements. Statistical results showed that occurrence rate of TEC variations was highest in localized dayside regions, with exact local time and latitude of peak occurrence depending primarily on the dayside coupling rate of the solar wind and magnetosphere, as well as IMF orientation and magnitude in the Y-Z plane. Occurrence of TEC variations throughout the polar cap increased with solar wind-magnetosphere coupling rate and IMF magnitude. The solar wind dependence of occurrence rate largely reflected the location and rate of dayside magnetic reconnection and subsequent particle precipitation and polar cap convection. Amplitudes of TEC variations were largest around noon and increased throughout the polar cap with increased solar wind-magnetosphere coupling rate. These statistical results improve upon the existing observational picture of the polar ionosphere and will potentially facilitate development of models and techniques for mitigating impacts of the polar ionosphere on navigation signals and communication links.",

         "abstract": "Generated by interplanetary shocks or solar wind pressure pulses, shock aurora has transient, global, and dynamic significances and provides a direct manifestation of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction. As a part of a series of studies of the shock aurora, this paper focuses on the interaction at the morning magnetopause and its auroral manifestation at 06 magnetic local time, where the velocity and magnetic field shears dominate the interaction. Flow shears can generate wave-like structures inside a viscous boundary layer or even larger-scale vortices. These structures couple to the ionosphere via quasi-static field-aligned currents or via kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves. Potential drops along field-aligned filaments may be generated accelerating electrons to form auroral manifestations of the structures. A shock aurora event at dawnside is used to test this scenario. The findings include moving auroral streaks/rays that have a vertical profile from red (at 250 km altitude) to purple (at 100 km). The streaks moved antisunward along the poleward boundary of the oval at an ionospheric speed of 3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. It was mapped to the magnetopause flank at 133 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which was consistent with the observed speed of the magnetopause surface waves generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The calculated field-aligned potential drop using Haerendel's analytic model was 5 kV that reasonably explained the observations. The results support the above scenario and reveal that magnetic and velocity shears at the flanks of the magnetospause may be the main cause of the fast moving shock aurora streaks.",

The efficiency of such proton pitch angle scattering process is energy dependent and controlled by the radius of curvature of the magnetic field line (RCMFL). The protons scattered into the loss cone will precipitate into the ionosphere and excite proton auroras there. In this study, we propose techniques to calculate the RCMFL based upon multiprobe measurements under different probe geometries. We also demonstrate how to use the obtained RCMFL to evaluate the proton precipitation fluxes, and further use the proton precipitation features to help estimate the magnetosphere-ionosphere mapping. Our procedures are summarized as follows: (1) We calculate the RCMFL using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) multiprobe measurements. (2) With the obtained RCMFL, we evaluate the scattering efficiency and in turn the loss cone fluxes of the magnetospheric protons at different energy levels. (3) The above evaluation of the in situ loss cone fluxes is compared to the ionospheric measurements of proton precipitation fluxes in various energy ranges and/or the optical proton auroras to estimate the possible footprint of THEMIS probes in the ionosphere.",

On 23 March 2007 the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellite constellation provided us with a unique opportunity to study a substorm injection in the region beyond geosynchronous orbit. On this date all five THEMIS spacecraft observed a substorm injection in the near-Earth magnetotail (X \u223c -7 R<SUB>E</SUB>). We traced the trajectories of millions of protons coming from the solar wind in the time-dependent magnetic and electric fields obtained from a global MHD simulation of this substorm. The results reproduced the main features of the injection observed by THEMIS and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) spacecraft, including the timing and dispersion properties of energetic flux increases. It was found that there were primarily two energization regions where particles gained energy during the substorm. One is around the near-Earth X line (X\u223c -20 R<SUB>E</SUB>), where particles were mostly accelerated nonadiabatically by strong electric fields (both inductive and potential). The others were several stretched or localized regions between X = -7 R<SUB>E</SUB> and X = -18 R<SUB>E</SUB>, where particles were accelerated in nonadiabatic motion under the potential electric field.",

The method combines two previously developed and tested techniques, namely, the retrieval of electron density profiles from radio occultations using an improved Abel inversion technique and a two-component model for the topside ionosphere plus protonosphere. Taking measurements of the total electron content from global ionospheric maps and radio occultations from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate/FORMOSAT-3 constellation, the ionospheric and plasmaspheric electron contents are calculated for a sample of observations covering 2007, a period of low solar and geomagnetic activity. The results obtained are shown to be consistent with previous studies for the last solar minimum period and with model calculations, confirming the reversal of the winter anomaly, the hemispheric asymmetry of the semiannual anomaly, and the existence in the plasmasphere of an annual anomaly in the South American sector of longitudes. The analysis of the respective fractional contributions from the ionosphere and the plasmasphere to the total electron content shows quantitatively that during the night the plasmasphere makes the largest contribution, peaking just before sunrise and during winter. On the other hand, the fractional contribution from the ionosphere reaches a maximum value around noon, which is nearly independent of season and geomagnetic latitude.",

A critical question is that if the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction drives only the open field region in the polar caps, how the solar wind energy and momentum are transmitted to the low latitude and equatorial ionosphere. This important issue has been studied over decades and is still poorly understood, impeding space weather forecasting ability. Here we use our newly developed 2.5-D ionosphere-thermosphere simulation model that self-consistently solves the density, velocity, and temperature for electrons, multiple ion and neutral species, and electromagnetic fields to study this challenging problem. The focus of the present study is on the prompt response of the ionosphere to a convection disturbance from the polar magnetosphere. The longer time scale responses caused by the neutral winds from the polar caps will be the topic of future studies. We show that the momentum is transferred from polar to equatorial ionosphere predominately by fast magnetosonic waves, and propagation of perturbations from the source region experiences delay, damping, and substantial reflection, and the ionosphere/thermosphere behaves like a low-band-pass filter. The finding from this study sheds new insight onto coupling processes within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

With the rapid development of Chinese BeiDou and European Galileo systems, they are playing an increasingly important role for modeling global ionosphere. Meanwhile, satellite altimetry provides valuable and precise ionosphere delay over the oceans. Through introducing priori ionosphere values from an advanced empirical ionosphere model, combining the advantages of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and satellite altimetry technologies, the precision of global ionosphere estimation can be further improved. To assess the improvement, we collect satellite altimetry data from Jason-2/3 and more than 300 global GNSS stations, the data are processed in 2014 and 2018 when the Sun is in a high and a low activity conditions. The results suggest that the ionosphere determination based on multitechnique fusion in a solar-geomagnetic reference frame is well suitable to represent the ionosphere and its structure. The determined ionosphere achieves a better global consistency, and its formal accuracy is significantly reduced. By comparing with the International GNSS Service products, evaluating by satellite altimetry measurements, and independently validating with ionosonde techniques, it is proved that the ionosphere results are further improved through employing additional available data, especially for the ionosphere over the oceans.",

The fast mode may propagate across the magnetic field, spreading ULF wave energy throughout the magnetosphere, and couple with the shear Alfv\u00e9n mode to form field line resonances (FLRs). The FLR electric field in the magnetosphere may have sufficiently large amplitudes to energize electrons and enhance radiation belt particle diffusion rates. Ozeke et al.

In this paper we use a fully coupled ULF wave model to determine the ratio e<SUB>\u03bd</SUB><SUP>eq</SUP>/b<SUB>\u03bd</SUB><SUP>g</SUP> for a 5 mHz FLR formed at high latitudes. We find that Ozeke et al. (2009) underestimated the ULF wave magnetic field on the ground which varies with ionosphere Hall conductance. This difference is found to be caused by assuming a decoupled wave mode model for the ionosphere fields. Any relationship that involves ULF wavefields in the ionosphere must include the effects of ULF wave mode mixing.",

         "abstract": "Several studies have shown that the surroundings of the highest Andes mountains at midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere exhibit gravity waves (GWs) generated by diverse sources which may traverse the troposphere and then penetrate the upper layers if conditions are favorable. There is a specific latitude band where that mountain range is nearly perfectly aligned with the north-south direction, which favors the generation of wavefronts parallel to this orientation. This fact may allow an optimization of procedures to identify topographic GW in some of the observations. We analyze data per season to the east and west of these Andes latitudes to find possible significant differences in GW activity between both sectors. GW effects generated by topography and convection are expected essentially on the eastern side. We use satellite data from two different limb sounding methods: the Global Positioning System radio occultation (RO) technique and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument, which are complementary with respect to the height intervals, in order to study the effects of GW from the stratosphere to the ionosphere. Activity becomes quantified by the GW average potential energy in the stratosphere and mesosphere and by the electron density variance content in the ionosphere. Consistent larger GW activity on the eastern sector is observed from the stratosphere to the ionosphere (night values). However, this fact remains statistically significant at the 90% significance level only during winter, when GWs generated by topography dominate the eastern sector. On the contrary, it is usually assumed that orographic GWs have nearly zero horizontal phase speed and will therefore probably be filtered at some height in the neutral atmosphere. However, this scheme relies on the assumption that the wind is uniform and constant. Our results also suggest that it is advisable to separate night and day cases to study GWs in the ionosphere, as it is more difficult to find significant statistical differences during daytime. This may happen because perturbations induced by GWs during daytime are more likely to occur in a disturbed environment that may hinder the identification of the waves.",

         "abstract": "This simulation study investigated the electrodynamic impact of varying descriptions of the diffuse aurora on the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) system. Pitch angle diffusion caused by waves in the inner magnetosphere is the primary source term for the diffuse aurora, especially during storm time. The magnetic local time (MLT) and storm-dependent electrodynamic impacts of the diffuse aurora were analyzed using a comparison between a new self-consistent version of the Hot Electron Ion Drift Integrator with varying electron scattering rates and real geomagnetic storm events. The results were compared with Dst and hemispheric power indices, as well as auroral electron flux and cross-track plasma velocity observations. It was found that changing the maximum lifetime of electrons in the ring current by 2-6 h can alter electric fields in the nightside ionosphere by up to 26%. The lifetime also strongly influenced the location of the aurora, but the model generally produced aurora equatorward of observations.",

         "abstract": "The terrestrial magnetosphere is perpetually exposed to and significantly deformed by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the solar wind. This deformation is typically detected at discrete locations by space- and ground-based observations. Earth's aurora, on the other hand, is a globally distributed phenomenon that may be used to elucidate magnetospheric deformations caused by IMF variations, as well as plasma supply from the deformed magnetotail to the high-latitude atmosphere. We report the utilization of an auroral form known as the transpolar arc (TPA) to diagnose the plasma dynamics of the globally deformed magnetosphere. Nine TPAs examined in this study have two types of a newly identified morphology, which are designated as \"J\"- and \"L\"-shaped TPAs from their shapes and are shown to have antisymmetric morphologies in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, depending on the IMF polarity. The TPA-associated ionospheric current profiles suggest that electric currents flowing along the magnetic field lines (field-aligned currents [FACs]), connecting the magnetotail and the ionosphere, may be related to the \"J\"- and \"L\"-shaped TPA formations. The FACs can be generated by velocity shear between fast plasma flows associated with nightside magnetic reconnection and slower background magnetotail plasma flows. Complex large-scale TPA FAC structures, previously unraveled by an magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation, cannot be elucidated by our observations. However, our interpretation of TPA features in a global context facilitates the usage of TPA as a diagnostic tool to effectively remote sense globally deformed terrestrial and planetary magnetospheric processes in response to the IMF and solar wind plasma conditions.",

         "abstract": "Terrestrial Very-Low-Frequency (VLF) energy from both lightning discharges and radio transmitters has a role in affecting the energetic electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts, but quantification of these effects is particularly difficult, largely due to the collisional damping experienced in the highly variable electron density in the D- and E-region ionosphere. The Faraday International Reference Ionosphere (FIRI) model was specifically developed by combining lower-ionosphere chemistry modeling with in situ rocket measurements, and represents to date the most reliable source of electron density profiles for the lower ionosphere. As a full-resolution empirical model, FIRI is not well suited to D- and E-region ionosphere inversion, and its applicability in transionospheric VLF simulation and in remote sensing of the lower ionosphere is limited. Motivated by how subionospheric VLF remote sensing has been aided by the Wait and Spies (WS) profile (Wait &amp; Spies, 1964), in this study, we parameterize the FIRI profiles and extend the WS profile to the E-region ionosphere by introducing two new parameters: the knee altitude h<SUB>k</SUB> and the sharpness parameter for the E-region ionosphere \u03b2<SUB>E</SUB>. Using this modified WS profile, we calculate the expected signals at different receiver locations from the NAA, NPM, and NWC transmitters under the full range of possible ionospheric conditions. We also describe and validate a method about how these results can be readily used to translate VLF measurements into estimates of the lower ionosphere electron density. Moreover, we use this method to evaluate the sensitivity of different ground receiver locations in lower-ionosphere remote sensing.",

         "abstract": "The expansion phase of auroral substorms is characterized by the formation of an auroral bulge, and it is generally considered that a single bulge forms following each substorm onset. However, we find that occasionally two auroral intensifications takes place close in time but apart in space leading to the formation of double auroral bulges, which later merge into one large bulge. We report three such events. In those events the westward auroral electrojet intensified in each auroral bulge, and geosynchronous magnetic field dipolarized in the same sector. It appears that two substorms took place simultaneously, and each substorm was accompanied by the formation of its own substorm current wedge system. This finding strongly suggests that the initiation of auroral substorms is a local process, and there is no global reference frame for their development. For example, ideas such as (i) the auroralbreakup takes place in the vicinity of the Harang reversal and (ii) the westward traveling surge maps to the interface between the plasma sheet and low latitude boundary layer, do not necessarily hold for every substorm. Even if those ideas may be suggestive of causal magnetospheric processes, the reference structures themselves are probably not essential. It is also found that despite the formation of two distinct auroral bulges, the overall magnetosphere ionosphere current system is represented by one globally coherent system, and we suggest that its structure is determined by the relative intensities and locations of the two substorm current wedges that correspond to the individual auroral bulges.",

Using the Naval Research Laboratory SAMI2 (Sami2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere) and SAMI3 (Sami3 is Also a Model of the Ionosphere) codes, we simulate plasmasphere refilling following a model storm, reproducing this observed phenomenon. In doing so, we find that the refilling rate and resulting pTEC values are sensitive to the oxygen profile in the thermosphere and exosphere: the supply of H<SUP>+</SUP> in the topside ionosphere is limited by the local O<SUP>+</SUP> density, through H+O+\u2192H++O charge exchange. At solar minimum, the O<SUP>+</SUP> supply simply increases with the O density in the exosphere. At solar maximum, we find that O-O<SUP>+</SUP> collisions limit the O<SUP>+</SUP> density in the topside ionosphere such that it decreases with increasing O density. The paradox occurs because the pTEC metric gives electrons in the topside ionosphere more weight than electrons in the plasmasphere.",

         "abstract": "A solid understanding of the solar wind control of ground magnetic field disturbances is essential for utilizing the existing long time series of ground data to obtain information on solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. We have used 20 years of International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects magnetometer data (54\u00b0-76\u00b0 magnetic latitude) to study the solar wind control of the ionospheric equivalent current density and its time derivative (&lt;|dJ<SUB>eq</SUB>/dt|&gt;). We found that &lt;|dJ<SUB>eq</SUB>/dt|&gt; peaks at the premidnight and prenoon ends of the westward electrojet. The prenoon &lt;|dJ<SUB>eq</SUB>/dt|&gt; peak was most intense during fast solar wind and radial interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The location of the peak was not affected by the IMF orientation but persisted at 8-10 magnetic local time and 70\u00b0-75\u00b0 latitude, near the boundary between the westward and eastward electrojets. Sensitivity of this boundary to disturbances was suggested as a possible explanation for the persistent prenoon location of the peak. The premidnight peak was most intense during southward IMF orientation. While faster solar wind mainly resulted in more intense &lt;|dJ<SUB>eq</SUB>/dt|&gt; in the premidnight sector, stronger IMF caused the region of intense &lt;|dJ<SUB>eq</SUB>/dt|&gt; to spread to the postmidnight, dawn, and dusk sectors. A good correspondence was found between development of the nightside &lt;|dJ<SUB>eq</SUB>/dt|&gt; intensification and average substorm bulge and oval aurora as determined by Gjerloev et al. (2007). The bulge aurora covered the western end of the westward electrojet where the equivalent current also had a significant poleward component. The substorm oval aurora, on the other hand, extended eastward along the westward electrojet.",

Described is the plasma flow in the nightside ionosphere from the near-polar region from the polar cap to the auroral oval during the substorm preonset phase and two expansion onsets, EO1 and EO2, produced by reconnection in the closed tail (magnetic reconnection (MR1) and in the open tail lobes (MR2), respectively. We discuss the location of the MR2 region (is it near, middle, and/or distant tail?) and the EO2 trigger mechanism. The upward substorm current wedge field-aligned current (FAC) and the downward FAC in the polar cap dusk sector that were both produced by different types of magnetosphere-ionosphere feedback instability are found to provide the main contribution to the system of FACs during EO1 and EO2. Also, we obtain the estimates for the EO1 and EO2 power and energy. Addressed are the variations in the tail lobe magnetic flux and their (variations) association with EO2. In addition, we describe a 3-D system of mesoscale cells, each of which involves a plasma vortex and a local FAC maximum. The cells of this system in the inner magnetosphere and in the tail lobes intensify one after other within 2 min interval. At last, we substantiate the assumption that the fast plasma flow recorded by the Cluster satellites 7 min prior to EO1 was a bursty bulk flow from the most distant tail.",

Interaction of these superthermal electrons with the neutral atmosphere leads to the production of secondary electrons (E &lt; 500-600 eV) and, as a result, leads to the activation of lower energy superthermal electron spectra that can escape back to the magnetosphere and contribute to the thermal electron energy deposition processes in the magnetospheric plasma. The ECH and whistler mode chorus waves, however, can also interact with the secondary electrons that are coming from both of the magnetically conjugated ionospheres after they have been produced by initially precipitated high-energy electrons that came from the plasma sheet. After their degradation and subsequent reflection in magnetically conjugate atmospheric regions, both the secondary electrons and the precipitating electrons with high (E &gt; 600 eV) initial energies will travel back through the loss cone, become trapped in the magnetosphere, and redistribute the energy content of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Thus, scattering of the secondary electrons by ECH and whistler mode chorus waves leads to an increase of the fraction of superthermal electron energy deposited into the core magnetospheric plasma.",

         "abstract": "In order to understand temporal variations and spatial distributions of plasma density enhancements in the polar magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms, nearly simultaneous observations of storm time electron densities in the polar magnetosphere by the Akebono satellite and ion upflows in the polar ionosphere by the DMSP satellites were investigated. Akebono observations show that the electron densities were highest (&gt;100 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> at \u223c9000 km altitude) from the main to early recovery phases of geomagnetic storms. The regions of enhanced electron density were not localized but widely spread in the polar magnetosphere. Coordinated observations by the DMSP satellites detected ion upflows with large fluxes (\u223c10<SUP>10</SUP>/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/s) in and near the cusp, when the electron density enhancements were observed by the Akebono satellite. This result indicates that the storm time electron density enhancements are caused by cleft ion fountain mechanisms from the polar ionosphere. Very low-energy component (&lt;13 eV) of the cleft ion fountain drifted deep into the polar cap, and increased the plasma densities in a wide region of the polar cap and auroral zone. A large amount of the very low-energy plasma may flow out through the polar magnetosphere during the main phase of geomagnetic storms.",

Using test-particle simulations and considering intervals of weak geomagnetic activity, we find that the highest energization and minimum diffusion rates correspond to nightside ionosphere conditions. Conversely, the highest diffusion rates and minimum energization are seen for a perfectly reflecting ionosphere boundary. The maximum energies gained under dayside conditions, when Hall conductivity is included, are slightly greater than the maximum energy for similar conditions without Hall conductivity. The diffusion rates for dayside ionosphere conditions with only Pedersen conductivity are greater than the diffusion rates when Hall conductivity is included. These findings show that ULF wave-particle interactions in Earth's magnetosphere depend on the ionosphere conductance.",

         "abstract": "Drifting electron holes (DEHs), manifesting as sudden but mild dropout in electron flux, are a common phenomenon seen in the Earth's magnetosphere. It manifests the change of the state of the magnetosphere. However, previous studies primarily focus on DEHs during geomagnetically active time (e.g., substorm). Not until recently have quiet time DEHs been reported. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the quiet time DEHs. BeiDa Imaging Electron Spectrometer (BD-IES) measurements from 2015 to 2017 are investigated. Twenty-two DEH events are identified. The DEHs cover the whole energy range of BD-IES (50-600 keV). Generally, the DEHs are positively dispersive with respect to energy. Time-of-flight analysis suggests the dispersion results from electron drift motion and gives the location where the DEHs originated from. Statistics reveal the DEHs primarily originated from the postmidnight magnetosphere. In addition, superposed epoch analysis applied to geomagnetic indices and solar wind parameters indicates these DEH events occurred during geomagnetically quiet time. No storm or substorm activity could be identified. However, an investigation into nightside midlatitude ground magnetic records suggests these quiet time DEHs were accompanied by Pi2 pulsations. The DEH-Pi2 connection indicates a possible DEH-bursty bulk flow (BBF) connection, since nightside midlatitude Pi2 activity is generally attributed to magnetotail BBFs. This connection is also supported by a case study of coordinated magnetotail observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. Therefore, we suggest the quiet time DEHs could be caused by magnetotail BBFs, similar to the substorm time DEHs.",

         "abstract": "Estimating the Joule heating rate using models of electric field and conductance requires removal of various biases, which arise because the models have uncertainty. This problem has been referred to as electric field variability, although variability of the conductance is also at issue. Variability of the conductance can contribute to the bias on Joule heating if it is correlated with the variability of the squared electric field. The term \u201cvariability,\u201d however, includes two distinct sources of model uncertainty: physical fluctuations on a small scale below the resolution of the model (small-scale variability) and uncertainty in the model's predictions even on the scale that it does resolve (resolved-scale model uncertainty). Previous work has tended to mix small-scale variability with resolved-scale model uncertainty in a way that may have led to confusion. In this work we separately analyze the small-scale variability and the resolved-scale model uncertainty using the Sondrestrom radar database, and we find that each gives a significant contribution to the bias on Joule heating. We also analyze the correlation of conductance and squared electric field, again in a way that distinguishes the effect of correlation over small scales from the effect of correlation of the resolved-scale model uncertainties. We explain that small-scale variability, being the result of actual physical fluctuations on small scales, is a more general quantity than resolved-scale model uncertainty; the latter is only defined with respect to a particular model.",

         "abstract": "A multiple magnetopause crossing event on 24 March 1995 is examined to investigate the structures of plasma in the boundary regions of the magnetotail. The event was observed by Geotail crossing the magnetopause at the duskside flank of the near-Earth magnetotail. The interplanetary magnetic field had been sustained northward for more than 6 h before the event. Repeated patterns of variations in the temperature and density of plasma suggest strongly the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz billows on the magnetopause. In agreement with previous papers, a magnetospheric region, termed the magnetotail low-latitude boundary layer (T-LLBL), is identified where parallel anisotropic ions flow tailward with the speed slower than \u223c150 km/s. A new finding is that there is a region, termed the low-latitude interactive region (T-LLIR), filled with isotropic ions flowing tailward with the speed of \u223c150 km/s between the magnetopause and the T-LLBL. The T-LLIR was found on the surface of magnetospheric billows but seemed not to exist near the trough between billows. The energy spectrum of the ion momentum (\u201cthe momentum spectrum\u201d for simplicity) is first introduced to examine the characteristics of these boundary regions. It is shown that the momentum spectra in different regions show different profiles. The profile in the T-LLIR looks like an intermediate of those obtained in the magnetosheath and the T-LLBL. Using a multivariate Maxwellian mixture model, it is found that the distribution function of ions in the T-LLIR is composed of two cold components and one hot component. A significant feature in this model is that the bulk speed of a hotter component is faster. In contrast, the bulk speeds of the three Maxwellian components are nearly equal to each other in the T-LLBL. These characteristics in the distribution functions are responsible for the differences in the momentum spectra. The role of the T-LLIR in momentum and particle transportation to the magnetosphere from the magnetosheath is discussed.",

         "abstract": "East-west anisotropies in GOES solar energetic particle (SEP) flux observations provide evidence of a time-varying radial gradient between L \u2248 4 and L \u2248 7. During elevated auroral activity, the gradient, represented by the ratio of inner (eastward-observed) to outer (westward-observed) fluxes, exhibits undulations lasting 1-3 h. A superposed epoch analysis based on 85 geosynchronous field dipolarizations observed during 19 SEP events between 1998 and 2006 shows that &gt;4 MeV inner proton fluxes increase as the geosynchronous field stretches during substorm growth phase, then decrease gradually following field dipolarization at substorm onset. This behavior is distinct from the sharp increase of outer belt electrons and protons at the time of the dipolarization. The undulations indicate that substorm-related field changes in the near-Earth magnetotail enhance access of SEPs to the inner magnetosphere (down to L \u2248 4). The observation of undulations at geosynchronous orbit is suppressed during high solar wind dynamic pressure (P<SUB>dyn</SUB> &gt; 5 nPa) or strong geomagnetic storm conditions (Dst\u2217 &lt; -100 nT) because the radial gradient is greatly reduced under these conditions and the interplanetary flux level provides an upper limit to the SEP fluxes in the magnetosphere. A sequence of 10 SEP undulations was observed during and following the 18 April 2002 sawtooth event. Analysis of this sequence shows that undulations observed at all local times are associated with substorm-related field changes on the nightside. GOES eastward SEP observations at all local times can thus serve as global trace particle sensing of substorm-related field reconfigurations in the near-Earth magnetotail.",

         "abstract": "It is suggested that the magnetosphere tries to stabilize itself by quickly unloading the magnetic energy accumulated within its main body, when the accumulated magnetic energy exceeds a limited amount, which can be identified as the energy for the expansion phase. It is this process which manifests as the impulsive expansion phase, during which auroral arcs advance well beyond the presubstorm latitude in the midnight sector. It was shown in the previous paper that the magnetotail does not have enough magnetic energy for a medium substorm (energy 5 \u00d7 10<SUP>15</SUP> J; AE = 1000 nT). In this paper, it is shown that (1) the reason of the short lifetime (1-1.5 h) of the expansion phase is due to the fact that a limited amount of magnetic energy accumulated during the growth phase is dissipated in a period similar to the duration of the growth phase (1-1.5 h); the accumulation rate is similar to the dissipation rate during the expansion phase: (2) when the main body of the magnetosphere accumulates the magnetic energy, it is inflated; \u03b2 (= (nkT/B<SUP>2</SUP>/8\u03c0)) even at X<SUB>GSM</SUB> = -6 R<SUB>E</SUB> becomes close to 1.0 for magnetic energy (2.9 \u00d7 10<SUP>14</SUP> J) which is less than the amount consumed by a medium intensity substorm. (3) As a result, the plasma sheet current and thus the magnetosphere are expected to become unstable, unloading the accumulated excess magnetic energy and resulting in current reduction and deflation. (4) The resulting deflation can cause an earthward electric field of 5-50 mV/m, which can generate Bostrom's current system, which is mainly responsible in producing various phenomena of the expansion phase. (5) The large range of substorm intensity (AE = 100-2000 nT) is likely to be due to the location where the energy is accumulated; the closer is the distance to the Earth (X<SUB>GSM</SUB> between -10 R<SUB>E</SUB> and -4 R<SUB>E</SUB>), the more intense the substorm intensity is.",

         "abstract": "We present the results of a statistical study of the absolute and relative locations of the equatorward boundaries of the proton and diffuse electron auroras. The boundaries were analyzed using latitude scans of 630.0 and 486.0 nm (\u201cH<SUB>\u03b2</SUB>\u201d) emissions obtained with the meridian scanning photometers at Gillam and Pinawa, Canada with DMSP overflights. The aurora data were classified into three different steady geomagnetic activity states, one being long-duration quiet intervals and the other two being moderate and active steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events. Both case and statistical studies show that the quiet times dusk-premidnight proton aurora extends slightly equatorward of the electron aurora. This is reversed on the dawnside. In contrast, the electron aurora during moderate and active SMC intervals lies equatorward of the proton aurora throughout the entire nightside covered in this work (20-03 MLT). There is a dawn-dusk offset in the auroral oval location, with the proton aurora shifting toward premidnight and the electron aurora toward postmidnight. Moreover, with increasing geomagnetic activity, both of the auroras intrude to lower latitude. The penetration of the electron boundary equatorward of the proton precipitation across this MLT range has not been previously identified. We attribute this to the fact that the equatorward part of the diffuse electron aurora is produced by lower energy electrons to which the 630.0 nm emission is more responsive and so marks a more realistic location of the electron equatorward boundary than do the 557.7 nm and UV emissions used in previous intercomparisons of these boundaries.",

The electric circuit has three time constants: \u03c4<SUB>CR</SUB>(=CR), \u03c4LC(=\u221aLC), and \u03c4<SUB>L/R</SUB>(=L/R). Here \u03c4<SUB>CR</SUB> is of the order of the ion gyroperiod in the plasma sheet, \u03c4<SUB>LC</SUB> is a global timescale (2\u03c0\u03c4<SUB>LC</SUB> is several tens of minutes), and \u03c4<SUB>L/R</SUB> is even longer (several hours). Despite uncertainty in the estimate of each circuit element, \u03c4<SUB>CR</SUB> \u226a \u03c4<SUB>LC</SUB> \u226a \u03c4<SUB>L/R</SUB> holds generally for the magnetosphere, which characterizes the electric circuit as overdamped. The following implications are obtained: (1) During the substorm growth phase the cross-tail current increases continuously even if interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B<SUB>Z</SUB> does not change after southward turning; (2) the magnetotail current weakens following northward turnings if the change of IMF B<SUB>Z</SUB> is comparable to the preceding southward IMF B<SUB>Z</SUB>; otherwise it may strengthen continuously if more gradually; (3) during the early main phase of magnetospheric storms the enhancement of the lobe magnetic energy is far more prominent than the enhancements of the kinematic and kinetic energies of the plasma sheet plasma; (4) The efficiency of the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling changes on a timescale of several hours (\u03c4<SUB>L/R</SUB>) through the change of the tail flaring, and so does the cross polar-cap potential; and (5) the magnetospheric current system does not resonate to an oscillatory external driver, and therefore, the periodicity of some magnetotail phenomena reflects that of their triggers.",

Previously, two source regions of the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions have been proposed. The first one is the dayside polar region. Ions from the dayside polar region are transported to the lobe; then they are injected to the nightside plasma sheet during substorm expansion phase. The second one is the nightside aurora region. After the substorm onset, energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are extracted from the ionosphere with the auroral acceleration processes, and the O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are directly supplied to the nightside plasma sheet. We investigated the relative importance of these two regions on supplying the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions in the inner magnetosphere. We performed a test particle simulation in global MHD electromagnetic fields. We obtained the following results. (1) During the substorm growth phase, O<SUP>+</SUP> ions at tens of eV are extracted from the dayside polar region, resulting in the enhancement of the warm O<SUP>+</SUP> ions (hundreds of eV) in the lobe. After the substorm onset, the warm O<SUP>+</SUP> ions are nonadiabatically accelerated to tens of keV and injected to the inner magnetosphere. These O<SUP>+</SUP> ions contribute to most of the O<SUP>+</SUP> ring current. (2) O<SUP>+</SUP> ions at &lt; a few keVs are supplied from the nightside aurora region to the plasma sheet. However, their contribution to the O<SUP>+</SUP> ring current remains small. From the results, we concluded that the main source of the energetic O<SUP>+</SUP> ions is the dayside polar region.",

We use Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) data to give the spatial distribution of the Pi2/Pc4 and Pc5 band magnetic fluctuation amplitude near the magnetic equator in the magnetosphere. Statistical results can be summarized as follows: (1) strong ULF fluctuations are common in the magnetotail plasma sheet; the amplitude of all three components of magnetic fluctuations decreases with decreasing radial distance; (2) during periods of high AE index, fluctuations can propagate toward the Earth as far as the data cutoff in the nightside of the magnetosphere, and the amplitude of magnetic fluctuations is clearly stronger near the dusk sector of the synchronous orbit than that near the dawn sector, suggesting that the substorm particle injection has significant contribution to these fluctuations; (3) intense compressional Pc5 band magnetic fluctuations are a persistent feature near two flanks of the magnetosphere. Clear peaks of the compressional Pi2/Pc4 band magnetic fluctuation power near two flanks can be found during periods of fast solar wind, while the power of compressional Pi2/Pc4 band fluctuations is weak when the solar wind is slow. (4) Solar wind dynamic pressure and its variations can globally affect the ULF fluctuation power in the magnetosphere. Magnetic fluctuations near the noonside can penetrate from the magnetopause to the synchronous orbit or inner when solar wind pressure variations are large.",

The dayside SE population is generated both by photoionization of the thermosphere and by secondary electron production from impact ionization when the photoelectrons collide with upper atmospheric neutral particles. It is shown that a self-consistent approach to this problem produces significant changes, in comparison with other approaches, in the SE energy exchange between the plasmasphere and the two magnetically conjugate ionospheres. In particular, plasmaspheric transparency can vary by a factor of two depending on the thermal plasma content along the field line and the illumination conditions of the two conjugate ionospheres. This variation in plasmaspheric transparency as a function of thermal plasma and ionospheric conditions increases with L-shell, as the field line gets longer and the equatorial pitch angle extent of the fly-through zone gets smaller. The inference drawn from these results is that such a self-consistent approach to SE transport and energy deposition should be included to ensure robustness in ionosphere-magnetosphere modeling networks.",

We took into account that the electric field is transmitted into the ionosphere through a region of open field lines, and that the ionospheric conductivity in the polar cap and auroral zone may be different. Penetration of the electric field into the magnetosphere is linked with the generation of the Alfven wave, going out from the ionosphere into the solar wind and being coupled with the field-aligned currents at the boundary of the open field limes. The electric field of the outgoing Alfven wave reduces the original electric field and provides the saturation effect in the electric field and currents during strong geomagnetic disturbances, associated with increasing ionospheric conductivity. The electric field and field-aligned currents of this Alfven wave are dependent on the ionospheric and solar wind parameters and may significantly affect the electric field and field-aligned currents, generated in the polar ionosphere. Estimating the magnitude of the saturation effect in the electric field and field-aligned currents allows us to improve the correlation between solar wind parameters and resulting disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere.",

This simulation study uses two different global magnetosphere magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models to simulate two northward IMF events and study the evolution of the magnetotail. Both models show that the magnetotail may form a structure that is composed of a dawnside tail lobe and a duskside tail lobe, under northward IMF conditions with significant By, instead of a northern tail lobe and a southern tail lobe under southward IMF conditions. In this magnetic configuration, a tail lobe extends a domain from northern (southern) cusp to southern (northern) IMF. The larger the magnitude of IMF clock angle, the longer and wider the magnetotail. Such magnetic configuration suggests that magnetotail reconnection is possible to occur when the dawnside tail lobe contacts with the duskside tail lobe and thus a substorm is also possible to occur under northward IMF conditions with significant By.",

         "abstract": "Bursty enhancements of hot electrons (\u22730.5 keV) with duration of minutes sometimes occur in the tail magnetosheath. In this study we used the unique simultaneous measurements from the two Acceleration Reconnection Turbulence and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun probes to investigate the likely sources, spatial structures, and responsible processes for these hot electron enhancements. The enhancements can be seen at any distance across the magnetosheath, but those closer to the magnetopause are more often accompanied by magnetosheath density and flow magnitudes changing to more magnetosphere-like values. From simultaneous measurements with the two probes being on either side of magnetopause or both in the magnetosheath, it is evident that these hot electrons come from the magnetosphere near the current sheet without further energization and that the enhancements are a result of bursty lateral magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath, the enhancements and changes in the magnetosheath properties becoming smaller with increasing outward distance from the intrusion. From limited events having specific separation distances and alignments between the probes, we estimated that a single isolated enhancement can have a thin and elongated structure as narrow as 2 R<SUB>E</SUB> wide in the X direction, as long as over 7 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the Y direction, and as thin as 1 R<SUB>E</SUB> in the Z direction. We propose that Kelvin-Helmholtz perturbations at the magnetopause and subsequent magnetosphere-magnetosheath particle mixing due to reconnection or diffusion can plausibly play an important role in generating the bursty magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath and the hot electron enhancements.",

The second step is the interaction of these electrons with the ionosphere and atmosphere via their elastic and nonelastic collisions and reflection (backscatter) of degraded electrons back to magnetosphere and conjugate ionospheres. This paper presents the results of a newly developed scenario of nonsteady-state electron precipitation dynamics that accounts for magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere energy interplay over the entire energy range of the plasma sheet electron population and their affiliated secondary electrons. It also studies how both magnetically conjugate auroral regions work together with the magnetosphere in the formation of electron precipitation in the region of the diffuse aurora with the energy range coverage from 1 eV up to 10 keV.",

This substorm occurred during an extended (1 h 45 min) period of weak (-2.5 to -1.5 nT) southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Simulation results show that this substorm was internally triggered well before the IMF start to become more northerly. The southward IMF leads to an enhancement in the cross-polar cap potential, strong thinning of the current sheet, and pseudo-breakup in association with patchy reconnection. The southward IMF also produces an enhancement in the outflow of ionospheric oxygen into the current sheet. Because of the tilt of the magnetic field the strongest outflows originate from the southern polar cap. The arrival of these heavy ions in the tail occurs about 10 min prior to the observed substorm onset and leads to enhanced tail reconnection, including flux rope development and fast earthward flows. The interaction of these fast flows at the inner edge of the plasma sheet is closely associated with auroral onset, indicating that the substorm is internally triggered. Comparison with THEMIS data suggests that reconnection occurred earlier than THEMIS observations. The results show onset is associated with processes at the inner edge of the plasma sheet and is not directly related to the onset of reconnection. Comparison with THEMIS data indicates that processes at scale lengths less than 500 km are occurring.",

         "abstract": "this paper, a three-dimensional (3-D) global hybrid simulation code and a 3-D geocoronal hydrogen model are used to systematically study the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions at 30.4 nm produced by solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) in the Earth's magnetosheath, associated with different solar wind-interplanetary magnetic field (SW-IMF) conditions and different imaging perspectives. We have found that the EUV emission intensities in the magnetosheath are highly variable from several mR to ~1200 mR and increase with the flow speed, the density, the temperature, and the He<SUP>2+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> density ratio of the solar wind; the northward IMF leads to a minimum emission in the magnetosheath, whereas the southward IMF generates a maximum emission; with the increase of the magnitude of IMF, the emission pattern in the nightside splits from single field-aligned shape into a butterfly shape around the magnetic equator; and the EUV emissions vary with the imaging positions, reflecting different latitudinal and longitudinal information of the magnetosheath. It is noted that the SWCX EUV emissions in the magnetosheath for highly disturbed solar wind conditions should be considered in processing the Moon-based plasmaspheric EUV images. We suggest that EUV imaging of the global magnetosheath requires an EUV imager with large field-of-view, high-sensitivity, large dynamic range, and low intrinsic dark count rate. This investigation could provide us with an overall understanding on SWCX EUV emissions in the magnetosheath which can potentially be used to image the global magnetosheath to study the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling in the future.",

A new method is developed for automatic detection of absorption responses to substorm onsets. Superposed epoch analysis shows that absorption exhibits some fading prior to and a clear response preceding substorm onset. These features are interpreted as being due to the stretching of magnetic field lines and a rapid dipolarization during the late growth phase of a substorm. A distinct dependence on substorm onset location is discovered with response delay increasing with distance from substorm onset and all responses to closest substorms (within 250 km) preceding substorm onset by 1-5 min. The absorption propagation is further examined using the average velocity from the onset to the riometer location as well as instantaneous velocities for a short period of time when substorm-enhanced absorption reaches the field of view. Comparison of the two velocity estimates shows that the absorption propagation is slower and oriented in more poleward directions away from substorm onset, with some evidence of near instantaneous expansion in zonal directions over large distances of \u223c2000 km from onset followed by a slower expansion primarily in poleward and westward directions. The observations suggest that during substorms precipitating electrons in the high-energy part of the spectrum behave differently from their low-energy counterparts and that they exhibit some evidence of predictable behavior.",

In this paper, besides the model drivers used in previous studies, including the solar 10.7 cm radio flux (F10.7), auroral hemispheric power (HP) and cross-tail potential drop (CP), the eddy diffusion coefficient (ED), and nighttime vertical O<SUP>+</SUP> flux at the top boundary are also perturbed to generate ensemble members. Based on our developed EnKF data assimilation system, the impact of perturbing different model external forcing parameters on ensemble generation and forecast capability of ionosphere and thermosphere has been investigated in detail through a series of sensitivity tests and data assimilation experiments. This system uses the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) as a background model. The findings are summarized as follows: (a) Associated with perturbing two additional model forcing parameters, better ensemble members of ionosphere and thermosphere states of the background model can be generated during both daytime and nighttime. (b) The improvement of the forecast capability of the ionosphere and thermosphere variables can be further enhanced. This study can provide a reference for ensemble generating strategy for the coupled I-T EnKF data assimilation in the future.",

Previous simulation results showed that the density cells are only observed below about 350 km. In the present work, the global ionosphere-thermosphere model is used to investigate the mechanism for the absence of the isolated density cell in the high-altitude thermosphere during geomagnetic quiet time. The simulation results indicate that the ion convection tends to drive a neutral cyclonic flow on the dawnside of the Magnetic Pole in both the low- and high-altitude thermosphere. Around the center of the cyclonic flow, a downward wind is formed as a consequence of mass conservation. It is interesting that under the influence of the downward flow, a density depletion relative to the background density with the same magnitude is generated inside the cyclone, which is independent of altitude. In the low-altitude thermosphere, this density depletion is shown as an isolated low-density cell. However, in the high-altitude thermosphere, the ion drag-driven density depletion turns to be an insignificant structure, as compared to the strong day-night gradient of the background neutral density. Consequently, the isolated low-density cell does not stand out in the high-altitude thermosphere.",

         "abstract": "We present predictions for the evolution of FTEs generated by localized bursts of reconnection on a planar magnetopause that separates a magnetosheath region of high densities and weak magnetic field from a magnetospheric region of low densities and strong magnetic field. The magnetic fields present a shear angle of 105 degrees. Reconnection forms a pair of FTEs each crossing the magnetopause in the field reversal region and bulging into the magnetosphere and magnetosheath. At their initial stage they can be characterized as flux tubes since the newly reconnected magnetic field lines are not twisted. Reconnection launches Alfvenic perturbations that propagate along the FTEs generating high-speed jets, which move the pair of FTEs in opposite directions. As the FTE moves, it displaces the ambient magnetic field and plasma producing bipolar magnetic field and plasma velocity signatures normal to the nominal magnetopause in the regions surrounding the FTE. The combination of the ambient plasma with the FTE flows generates a vortical velocity pattern around the reconnected field lines. During its evolution the FTE evolves to a flux rope configuration due to the twist of the magnetic field lines. The alfvenic perturbations propagate faster along the part of the FTE bulging into the magnetosphere than in the magnetosheath, and due to the differences between the plasma and magnetic field properties the perturbations have slightly different signatures in the two regions. As a consequence, the FTEs have different signatures depending on whether the satellite encounters the part bulging into the magnetosphere or into the magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "The lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling problem is a challenge nowadays. It requires understanding of (a) the physical mechanism that is responsible for plasma disturbances generation at ionospheric heights, (b) the penetration of seismogenic impact from the ground into the ionosphere through the underlying neutral atmosphere, and (c) on-the-ground (in-the-ground) sources generation. Kuo et al. (2014) reported an improved model of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling that includes the ionosphere as well as the underlying neutral atmosphere (from the ground up to the ionosphere altitudes, i.e., 60-80 km above the Earth's surface). The main feature of the Kuo et al. (2014) approach is that they find ground-to-ionosphere currents from \u2207\u00b7J\u2192=0, J\u2192\u2261-\u2207\u03c8 system of equations. In contrast to Kuo et al. (2011), where well-known \u2207\u00b7J\u2192=0,J\u2192=\u03c3\u0302E\u2192,E\u2192=-\u2207\u03d5 equations are used, Kuo et al. (2014) looks better as it does not require the knowledge of electric conductivity \u03c3 profile. In this paper we show that the Kuo et al. (2014) equations can be obtained as a special case of the Kuo et al. (2011) ones, given the electric conductivity tensor is a spatially invariant scalar. Therefore, Kuo et al. (2014) formulation may not describe correctly electric currents flowing between the Earth and the ionosphere.",

The present paper uses the derived parameters (IpsDst, IpsKp, and IpsAE) giving the mean values of Dst, Kp, and AE during the main phase (MP) of Dst storms for investigating ionosphere-thermosphere storms and low-latitude (630 nm) aurora. The derived parameters (IpsDst, IpsKp, and IpsAE) representing the impulsive strength of geomagnetic storms seem to have more systematic dependence among themselves than among the intensities (DstMin, Kp<SUB>max</SUB>, and AE<SUB>max</SUB>). The ionosphere-thermosphere storms observed by the CHAMP (Challenging Minisatellite Payload) satellite and low-latitude auroras observed by optical imagers are much more intense during high impulsive storms than high intensity storms. In a statistical sense, over 175 positive ionospheric storms (\u25b3NmF2) observed in 1985-2005 and the intensity of 20 red auroras observed in 1989-2004 at midlatitudes correlate better with the impulsive parameters than the intensity parameters, with the best correlation being with IpsDst. The mechanism of the impulsive action (high-energy input over a short duration) leading to large IpsDst arises from the impact of fast solar storms (interplanetary coronal mass ejections) with large IMF Bz southward at their front (or shock). The impulsive action results in bright low-latitude auroras and strong ionosphere-thermosphere storms.",

We investigate the dayside diffuse aurora observed by the all-sky imagers of Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station in the time interval of 02:00-10:00 UT (05:00-13:00 magnetic local time) on 2 January 2006. In this interval, the intensity of dayside diffuse aurora is highly correlated with the solar wind dynamic pressure with a maximum coefficient of 0.89. Moreover, there are similar spectra characteristics in the Pc5 range between the intensity of dayside diffuse aurora and solar wind dynamic pressure (proton density) during a portion of the time interval, in which the interplanetary magnetic field B<SUB>z</SUB> is northward. The observation indicates that changes in solar wind dynamic pressure can efficiently modulate the magnitude of the dayside diffuse aurora, except when the interplanetary magnetic field is southward. The enhancement of the solar wind dynamic pressure can provide favorable circumstances for dayside chorus wave generation, so we consider that the dayside chorus could be a candidate for the production of the dayside diffuse aurora. Furthermore, since the compressional Pc4-Pc5 pulsations can also modulate the intensity of whistler mode chorus waves, the solar wind dynamic pressure modulates the dayside diffuse aurora through affecting dayside chorus wave activity and the associated scattering process.",

Here, we report a BBE event observed by the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) satellite at 1355-1359 UT, \u223c61\u00b0-66\u00b0 invariant latitudes, \u223c0600 magnetic local time (MLT), and \u223c3800 km altitude during a storm on 25 July 2004. The Double Star (DS) TC1 satellite was located near the magnetic equator at L = 5.7, close to the same local time as FAST. We investigate the acceleration process of BBEs from the inner magnetosphere to near the ionosphere by comparing electron data obtained by FAST and DS TC1. We also investigate both plasma and field variations in the inner magnetosphere associated with substorm onset using DS TC1 data to examine the relationship between the BBEs and the storm time substorm. Ground geomagnetic field data show a positive H-bay at \u223c1349 UT at \u223c0600 MLT, indicating that a storm time substorm started just before the appearance of the BBEs. At \u223c1350 UT, a tailward ion flow was observed by DS TC1. Then, DS TC1 observed a local dipolarization and a drastic ion density enhancement at \u223c1351 UT, indicating that particle heating associated with the substorm was occurring in the inner magnetosphere. From \u223c1352 UT, electron fluxes were isotropically enhanced at energies above \u223c0.5 keV as observed by DS TC1. On the other hand, the pitch angle distribution of BBEs at the FAST altitude showed field-aligned lower-energy electrons below \u223c0.5 keV and isotropic higher-energy electrons above \u223c0.5 keV. From these data, it was inferred that the BBEs might consist of two energy components due to the acceleration or heating of electrons at different altitudes in association with the storm time substorm.",

The primary focus is on a comparison between the isolated substorm and the substorm that initiates the SMC. Auroral data from Polar UVI LBHl and LBHs, along with assimilative mapping of the ionosphere electrojet potential patterns are used as inputs to the global ionosphere-thermosphere model to calculate conductances and Joule heating rates. Results from this study show that the conductances both before and during the events play a large role the ability of the magnetosphere to remain in steady driven state. The substorm that initiates the SMC event shows very different signatures in the ionosphere than isolated substorm; these signatures indicate that there is very weak substorm current wedge, or possibly a pseudo-breakup.",

         "abstract": "The plasma-sheet dynamics leading to the substorm onset is analyzed from a global simulation. We calculated three cases, the normal (case 1), reduced magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling (case 2) and reduced tail dissipation (case 3). The normal solution reproduces the thinning, reconnection, tail flow, and the dipolarization in the magnetosphere, and the AU/AL, the initial brightening, the beads, the pre-onset arc, and the poleward expansion in the ionosphere. Case 2 shows that the M-I coupling promotes the thinning by evacuating magnetic field from the plasma sheet. Case 3 shows that it is implausible to reproduce the AU/AL of the expansion phase only with numerical dissipation. The projection area of the growth phase plasma sheet is so narrow that the quiet arcs on the high-latitude side are projected to the lobe. The key point to understand such narrow projection is to consider the origin of the field-aligned current (FAC). The FAC occurs to transmit motion, and particle precipitation is the consequence. The upward FACs for the quiet arc and initial brightening, which produce the substorm sequence, are generated to transmit enhanced convection from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. The substorm onset is the transmission of the convection transient. The onset FAC is generated by the near-earth dynamo. Before the onset, a two-stage reconnection occurs at the medium-tail (MTNL) and the near-earth (NENL) neutral lines through retreating nulls. The accompanying flow explains the model that assumes two causal areas for the onset in the near-earth and middle tails.",

During this interval, all five THEMIS probes are closely aligned along the tail axis near midnight covering a radial range from \u223c9 Re to \u223c18 Re. After the substorm onset, plasma sheet expansions take place successively at multiple locations in the magnetotail as measured by different probes. The positions of the plasma sheet expansions have a tailward leap progression with an average velocity of \u223c36 km/s. There are two types of dipolarization detected in this substorm. The first type is the dipolarization front which is associated with the bursty bulk flow (BBF). While the second type, which we call \u2018global dipolarization\u2019, is associated with plasma sheet expansions. In the substorm studied, there are four intensifications as shown in the THEMIS AE index. We can detect the effects of localized and short-lived magnetic energy release processes occurring in the magnetotail corresponding to each of the four AE intensifications. Furthermore, the inner four probes can detect the global dipolarization signatures \u223c4-15 min earlier than plasma sheet expansions, while the outermost probe (P1) cannot detect this before the plasma sheet expansion. These two phenomena are caused by the same process (magnetic energy release process) but the effects detected by probes locally appear delayed. The observations in this case are not sufficient to distinguish between the two competing substorm models.",

         "abstract": "The question of whether an interplanetary (IP) fast-mode shock can trigger the substorm expansion is still not resolved. Some scientists believe that the substorm expansion can be triggered by a sudden compression of the magnetosphere if a substorm growth phase is in progress (e.g., the magnetosphere precondition hypothesis). Such a hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Here we study 258 positive sudden impulse (SI<SUP>+</SUP>) events associated with interplanetary fast-mode shocks observed by the ACE spacecraft from 1998 to 2009. The westward auroral electrojet SML index, derived from the SuperMAG network geomagnetic field data, is used to check for negative magnetic bays. It is found that the probability of having a magnetic bay onset that follows a shock impact peaks ( 27%) sharply and immediately (within 3 min) after the shock-induced SI<SUP>+</SUP>. This indicates that the majority of the shock events do not lead to magnetic bays. A superposed epoch analysis of the shock events associated with (Type-Y) and without (Type-N) negative bays indicates that the Type-Y events had stronger ( 40%) solar wind driving than the Type-N ones. This result generally supports the magnetosphere precondition hypothesis. We also found that (1) Type-Y events are associated with even stronger ( 56%) solar wind driving downstream of the shock than Type-N events and (2) there is a good correlation between the SML and the polar cap magnetic PC indices both upstream and downstream of the shock. It is suggested that sharp decreases in SML immediately after a shock impact are not associated with the substorm-driven DP-1 current system but with the convection-driven DP-2 current system.",

In this work, the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC-2) radio occultation total electron content was assimilated around a whole year from October 2020 to September 2021 via the Kalman filter (KF) data assimilation system. This system includes an empirical ionosphere background model and the KF data assimilation algorithm. Accurate 3-D ionosphere data assimilation results were produced hourly with spatial resolutions of 2\u00b0 latitude, 5\u00b0 longitude, and 20 km height in low-latitude and equatorial regions. First, the results were validated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology vertical total electron content and global ionosonde data. The ionosphere vertical total electron content and the critical frequency at the F2 layer agree well with the independent observations. Then, a general ionosphere climatological pattern is found in the reconstructed 3D ionosphere results, including seasonal variation, annual asymmetry, and December anomaly. In addition, the results can well capture the daily spatial and temporal ionospheric variations in the day-to-day variability, the longitudinal wave 4 structures, and the interhemispheric asymmetry transition of the equatorial ionization anomaly crests. The current results demonstrate that assimilating COSMIC-2 TEC observations can further improve the 3D ionosphere specification in low-latitude and equatorial regions and can also contribute to physical research on ionosphere variability characteristics.",

Of the 12 Cluster-observed whistler events reported, EUV is able to provide global imaging of the plasmasphere for every event and demonstrates a direct correlation between the detection of lightning-generated whistlers beyond the plasmapause and the presence of a global perturbation of the local plasmapause. Of these 12 correlated events, seven of the Cluster-observed whistlers (or 58%) are associated with the Cluster spacecraft lying radially outward from a plasmaspheric notch. Two of the Cluster-observed whistlers (17%) are associated with the low-density region between the late afternoon plasmapause and the western wall of a plasmaspheric drainage plume. The final three Cluster-observed whistler events (25%) are associated with a nonradial, nonazimuthal depletion in plasmaspheric He<SUP>+</SUP> emission that are termed \"notch-like\" crenulations. In one of these cases, the notch-like crenulations appear to be manifestations entrained within the plasmasphere boundary layer of a standing wave on the surface of the plasmasphere. The correlated Cluster/IMAGE-EUV observations suggest that the depleted flux tubes that connect the ionosphere to the low-density regions of plasmaspheric trough and inner magnetosphere facilitate the escape of whistler waves from the plasmasphere.",

One of the parameters that is important in the lower thermosphere is atomic oxygen. It has recently been observed that atomic oxygen is higher in summer at \u223c95 km. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of the upper thermosphere to lower thermospheric atomic oxygen using the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM). We use the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) to drive the lower atmospheric boundary of atomic oxygen in GITM between \u223c95 and 100 km and compare the results with the current mass spectrometer incoherent scatter (MSIS) driven GITM. MSIS has higher atomic oxygen in the winter hemisphere while WACCM-X has higher atomic oxygen in the summer hemisphere. The reversal of atomic oxygen distribution affects the pressure distribution between 100 and 120 km, such that the hemisphere with larger O number density has stronger equatorward winds, and lower temperature mainly due to adiabatic and radiative cooling. This affects thermospheric scale heights such that the hemisphere with more O has lower N<SUB>2</SUB> and thus enhanced O/N<SUB>2</SUB>. This behavior is observed in the opposite hemisphere when MSIS is used as the lower boundary for GITM. Overall, O/N<SUB>2</SUB> for WACCM-X driven GITM matches better with the global ultraviolet imager (GUVI) data. We find that the impact of lower thermospheric atomic oxygen on upper thermosphere is not just through diffusive equilibrium but also through secondary effects on winds and temperature.",

In this study, we present a statistical analysis of substorms with different intensities that occurred from 1982 to 2012. We investigated the substorm occurrence rate, the time evolution of solar wind and geomagnetic parameters, as well as the SME, SMU and, SML indices during these substorms by using OMNI and SuperMag networks data sets. We find that substorms more frequently occur during solar declining phases and in spring and autumn due to the Russel-McPherron effect. The superposed SME index shows a double-peak near midnight and dusk during intense substorms, standing for comparable eastward and westward electrojets. We suggest that there is an additional current wedge during intense substorms located near the dusk. During the substorm expansion phase, eastward and westward electrojets are expanding against their current direction. The results presented in this study provide a comprehensive view of substorm characteristics with different intensities and may facilitate the understanding of the development of auroral electrojets in the ionosphere, even the current system in the magnetosphere.",

The interchange cycle results from the coupling of IMF-to-lobe reconnection and lobe-to-closed reconnection. Using a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation code, for an IMF clock angle of 20\u00b0 (measured from due north), we successfully reproduced the following features of the interchange cycle. (1) In the ionosphere, for each hemisphere, there appears a reverse cell circulating exclusively in the closed field line region (the reciprocal cell). (2) The topology transition of the magnetic field along a streamline near the equatorial plane precisely represents the magnetic flux reciprocation during the interchange cycle. (3) Field-aligned electric fields on the interplanetary-open separatrix and on the open-closed separatrix are those that are consistent with IMF-to-lobe reconnection and lobe-to-closed reconnection, respectively. These three features prove the existence of the interchange cycle in the simulated magnetosphere-ionosphere system. We conclude that the interchange cycle does exist in the real solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. In addition, the simulation revealed that the reciprocal cell described above is not a direct projection of the diffusion region as predicted by the \"vacuum\" model in which diffusion is added a priori to the vacuum magnetic topology. Instead, the reciprocal cell is a consequence of the plasma convection system coupled to the so-called NBZ (\"northward &lt;fi&gt;B&lt;/fi&gt;<SUB>&lt;fi&gt;z&lt;/fi&gt;</SUB>\") field-aligned current system.",

Observations at fixed positions for an extended period of time are provided by a ground-based all-sky imager measuring the 557.7 nm auroral emissions. We report on a single event of nightside aurora (\u223c22 magnetic local time) preceding a substorm onset. To determine the spatiotemporal characteristics, we perform an innovative analysis of an all-sky imager movie (19 min duration, images at 3.31 Hz) that combines a two-dimensional spatial fast Fourier transform with a temporal correlation. We find a scale size-dependent variability where the largest scale sizes are stable on timescales of minutes while the small scale sizes are more variable. When comparing two smaller time intervals of different types of auroral displays, we find a variation in their characteristics. The characteristics averaged over the event are in remarkable agreement with the spatiotemporal characteristics of the nightside field-aligned currents during moderately disturbed times. Thus, two different electrodynamical parameters of the M-I coupling show similar behavior. This gives independent support to the claim of a system behavior that uses repeatable solutions to transfer energy and momentum from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "Numerical experiments performed with the National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model forced with an observationally based diurnal and semidiurnal tidal spectrum are utilized to investigate the physical processes by which the dissipation of vertically propagating tides act to alter the zonally and diurnally averaged (\"zonal-mean\") dynamical state of the thermosphere. Below 150 km the largest contributors to the zonal-mean zonal wind distribution are the pressure gradient, Coriolis, and the tidally driven momentum flux divergence terms, the latter being about half the former two. Ion drag plays a smaller role in the lower thermosphere but becomes increasingly important at higher altitudes (i.e., above \u223c150 km). We also find that the tidally driven heat flux divergence term contributes to the generation of zonal-mean zonal winds through its coupling into the pressure gradient term. Tidally induced zonally and diurnally averaged zonal wind changes achieve values of up to 30 m/s in the lower thermosphere, of which about a third can be traced to the heat flux divergence. Tidal amplitudes used to force the thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model lower boundary represent conservative estimates, since they are based on forcing by a multiyear 60-day mean tidal climatology, which significantly underestimates their amplitudes at any given time. Eliassen-Palm Fluxes further support the conclusion that the heat flux divergence has a statistically significant direct impact on the zonal-mean zonal wind balance in the lower thermosphere.",

These filaments show the stable antisunward motion (while the ambient magnetospheric plasma moved in the opposite direction) and the existence of a strip of magnetospheric plasma, separating these filaments from the magnetosheath. These results, however, contradict both theoretical studies and simulations by Schindler (1979), Ma et al. (1991), Dai and Woodward (1994, 1998), and other researchers, who reported that the motion of such filaments through the magnetosphere is possible only when their magnetic field is directed very close to the ambient magnetic field, which is not the situation that is observed. In this study, we show that this seeming contradiction may be related to different events as the theoretical studies and simulations are related to the case when the filament magnetic field is about aligned with filament orientation, whereas the observations show that the magnetic field in these filaments may be rotating. In this case, the rotating magnetic field, changing incessantly its direction, drastically affects the penetration of plasma filaments into the magnetosphere. In this case, the filaments with rotating magnetic field, even if in each moment it is significantly inclined to the ambient magnetic field, may propagate through the magnetosphere, if their average (for the rotation period) magnetic field is aligned with the ambient magnetic field. This shows that neglecting the rotation of magnetic field in these filaments may lead to wrong results.",

         "abstract": "Polar rain electrons with energy around 1 keV occasionally fill the polar cap ionosphere. Their energy flux is high enough to produce detectable auroral emissions, called polar rain aurora (PRA). We report a PRA event on 2 August 2002 and the estimation of the magnetotail reconnection location and size from the PRA boundary. The distinguishing feature of this event identified from the TIMED/GUVI data is an emission depletion gap between PRA and auroral oval. The size of the gap is about 2\u00b0 in latitude and extended from the dusk sector (17:00 MLT) to the premidnight sector (22:00 MLT). This gap coincides with the electron flux gap in the DMSP electron energy flux data. The electron flux data show the existence of energy dispersion at the gap. These GUVI and DMSP observations support the idea that the gap is very likely due to a magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail that blocks the solar wind electron entry into the polar ionosphere. Based on the electron energy dispersion, the nightside X line is estimated to be at X = -50 to -60 R<SUB>E</SUB>, which is consistent with results from other studies. The gap extends from the nightside to the duskside and presumably to the dawnside. This new information suggests that the extension of the tail X line over the entire plasma sheet in the dawn-dusk direction under a strongly southward IMF (B<SUB>z</SUB> \u223c -10 nT) and the curved nature of the X line.",

Three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the LFM (Lyon-Fedder-Mobary) code were run to determine the expected signatures of magnetotail-disconnection events as seen by a spacecraft. Fourty-four magnetotail entry events on the dawnside of the distant magnetotail in the years 1993-1994 were examined individually and using superposed-epoch analysis. Signatures in the GEOTAIL measurements consistent with entry into the magnetotail from the magnetosheath caused by disconnection events were seen, particularly the temporal pattern of plasma flow and the temporal pattern of the magnetic field direction. Conclusive observations of magnetotail disconnections will probably have to await having measurements with a constellation of spacecraft in the magnetotail.",

         "abstract": "The magnetospheric substorm is important not only because it involves many interesting physical processes but also because it plays a key role in the solar wind energy dissipation into the ionosphere. This paper focuses on a quantitative description of the Joule heating production rate generated during substorms by auroral electrojets that are composed of two aspects: convection electrojets and the substorm electrojet. First, the natural orthogonal component (NOC) method is carefully discussed by examining its methodology and by comparing with other mathematical techniques and ionospheric observations. It is concluded that the NOC method is a very helpful and unique method that sheds insight into the electric potential patterns in the high-latitude ionosphere. Then, using the AMIE electric potential and the NOC method, the sawtooth event on 18 April 2002 and an isolated substorm on 15 November 2001 are studied. Electric fields and Joule heating rates corresponding to the convection electrojets and the substorm electrojet, respectively, are obtained. It is found that the Joule heating associated with the substorm electrojet is only one fourth to one third of that associated with the convection electrojets during the sawtooth event. However, the former dominated the total Joule heating during the expansion phase of the isolated substorm, and the two types of the Joule heating are comparable in magnitude in the isolated substorm recovery phase.",

We find that a peculiar Region 2 field-aligned current (R2 FAC) caused by a transient dynamo is enhanced in the ionosphere and, consequently, the convection field in the ionosphere is overshielded after the northward turn of the IMF. On the other hand, in the magnetosphere, the transient dynamo appears on the lower-latitude side of the dayside cleft. This dynamo is driven by the sunward convection flow that descends the enhanced pressure slope in the cleft region. This sunward flow and the enhanced pressure are caused by the release of magnetic tension accumulated in the southward IMF interval. Simultaneously, a counterclockwise vortex on a sphere of r = 8 Re (a clockwise vortex in the equatorial plane) in the afternoon sector appears in the magnetosphere. Consequently, the overshielding potential due to the R2 FAC in the ionosphere is a counterpart of the flow vortex in the magnetosphere. Finally, we note that the effect of the \u2207B/curvature drift, which is due to the ring current particles, may be insignificant because the dynamo responsible for the overshielding appears in the higher-latitude region.",

         "abstract": "Substorm activity is heavily influenced by the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) B<SUB>z</SUB> component and magnetospheric substorms occur most frequently when B<SUB>z</SUB> is strongly negative. The substorm occurrence rate is also affected by the magnitude of the B<SUB>y</SUB> component, but it is usually presumed that this contribution is independent of the sign of B<SUB>y</SUB>. Using five independent substorm onset lists, we show that substorm activity does depend on the sign of B<SUB>y</SUB> near the solstices. Specifically, we show that substorms occur more frequently when B<SUB>y</SUB> and the dipole tilt angle \u03a8 have different signs as opposed to when they have the same sign. These results confirm that the magnetosphere exhibits an explicit dependence on the polarity of B<SUB>y</SUB> for nonzero \u03a8, as other recent studies have suggested, and imply variation in the dayside reconnection rate and/or the magnetotail response. On the other hand, we find no clear relationship between substorm intensity and B<SUB>y</SUB> regardless of \u03a8. Last, for the onset list based on identifying negative bays at auroral latitudes, we observe an overall trend of more frequent onsets for positive B<SUB>y</SUB>, regardless of season. However, substorm frequency in the other four substorm lists does not exhibit an overall preference for positive B<SUB>y</SUB>. We show that this phenomenon is very likely a consequence of the particular substorm identification method (i.e., identification of negative bays), which is affected by local ionospheric conditions that depend on B<SUB>y</SUB> and \u03a8.",

The simulated IMF transitions hold from a steady southward IMF to a steady northward IMF before suddenly transitioning back to southward IMF after 20 min. Once the IMF returns southward, the M-I system is in a state of reduced energy dissipation for approximately an hour as it reconfigures back into a standard southward IMF configuration. We find that the northward IMF excursion affects both the viscous and reconnection interactions with the solar wind. The flow of plasma in the magnetosphere is significantly disrupted by the reconnection cycle under northward IMF. This reduce the transfer of mechanical energy from the solar wind due to the viscous interaction, and the magnetosphere-ionosphere system is in a mixed topological configuration containing elements produced by both of southward IMF reconnection and the Dungey cycle, as well as northward IMF reconnection and the presence of reverse cell convection at high latitudes. The effects of the transient northward IMF must be completely cleared out before the system can return to an optimal state of energy transfer characteristic of steady southward IMF. As a result, a simple 20 min excursion of northward IMF can put the magnetosphere-ionosphere system into a reduced state of coupling to the solar wind for some time following the return to steady southward IMF; for LFM we saw a reduced state lasting an hour",

The persistent electron drift loss makes the geosynchronous satellites cannot observe the substorm electron injection phenomenon during the two substorm expansion phases (06:57-07:39 UT) on that day. Behind the IP shock, the fluctuations ( 0.5-3 nPa) of solar wind dynamic pressure not only alter the dayside auroral brightness but also cause the entire auroral oval to swing in the day-night direction. However, there is no Pi2 pulsation in the nightside auroral oval during the substorm growth phase from 06:13 to 06:57 UT. During the subsequent two substorm expansion phases, the substorm expansion activities cause the nightside aurora oval brightening from substorm onset site to higher latitudes, and meanwhile, the enhancement (decline) of solar wind dynamic pressure makes the nightside auroral oval move toward the magnetic equator (the magnetic pole). These observations demonstrate that solar wind dynamic pressure changes and substorm expansion activities can jointly control the luminosity and location of the nightside auroral oval when the internal and external disturbances occur simultaneously. During the impact of a strong IP shock, the earthward movement of dayside magnetopause probably causes the disappearance of the substorm electron injections near geosynchronous orbit.",

In this study, for the first time, we use Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager observations over \u223c14 years to characterize the throat aurora occurrence, latitudinal extent, seasonal, and its solar cycle dependence. We identified 386 throat aurora cases during the different passes of the satellite over the northern hemisphere. The latitudinal extent of these throat aurorae are estimated and are divided into small, medium, and large categories. The small and medium latitudinal extent throat aurorae account for about 91% of the total cases. The throat aurorae are found to occur most frequently in the post-noon hours. The throat aurorae were also observed more frequently during winter, likely due to summer-winter asymmetry in the ionospheric conductance. The occurrence of the throat aurora is also found to be anti-correlated with the solar cycle, likely because low solar activity gives good chances for sporadic reconnection that favors the occurrence of throat aurora. The dependence on interplanetary magnetic field reveals positive Bx favoring the occurrence of throat aurora. It also shows positive Bx (negative By) supports pre-noon (post-noon) occurrence. The difference in the trend and average values of background interplanetary magnetic field conditions with the throat aurora confirms the favorable conditions for the occurrence of throat aurora.",

The results are summarized as follows. Substorm onsets, which we identify by auroral initial brightenings, are likely to occur in the more dusk-(dawn-)ward region when the O<SUP>+</SUP>/H<SUP>+</SUP> number density ratio is high in the dusk (dawn) side. This property is observed only in the near-Earth plasma sheet (at -8 R<SUB>E</SUB> &gt; X<SUB>GSM</SUB> &gt; -14 R<SUB>E</SUB>). The above-mentioned property holds in each of two groups: substorm events due to internal instability of the magnetosphere (i.e., internally triggered substorms) and events due to external changes in the solar wind or the interplanetary magnetic field (i.e., externally triggered substorms). Thus, we conclude that the substorm onset location depends on the density of O<SUP>+</SUP> ions in the near-Earth plasma sheet prior to onset, whether the substorm is triggered internally or externally.",

The coupling between oscillations in the dynamic pressure or magnetic field carried by the solar wind and the ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves detected on the ground at high latitudes has been suggested in several studies. We present results from a numerical study of ultra-low-frequency waves detected by the ground magnetometers at middle latitudes during substorm. We investigate the hypothesis that these waves are generated by the ionospheric feedback instability driven by the large-scale electric field in the ionosphere. This field is associated with the surface waves propagating along the ambient magnetic field on a strong perpendicular gradient in the plasma density occurring in the equatorial magnetosphere. The gradient in the plasma density is associated with the plasmapause. The plasmapause moves to the middle latitude when the plasmasphere erodes during substorm. The energy from the external driver can be coupled to the large-scale surface Alfv\u00e9n waves traveling along the field lines into the ionosphere and generating small-scale intense ULF waves and field-aligned currents at middle latitudes. The simulations of the two-fluid magnetohydrodynamics model confirm this scenario, and the numerical results show a good quantitative agreement with the observations.",

         "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to deliver a long-missing interpretation of a central issue of the NASA-MPE barium injection experiment performed in September 1971. It pertains to the interaction with the ionosphere. Observations of the cloud's motion revealed no obvious sign of such interaction. The barium vapor was released from a Scout rocket at an altitude of 31,000 km above South America during late evening hours and was observed for more than 4000 s. The barium plasma split into several field-parallel streaks which moved for a long time as if subject to constant acceleration as viewed from the inertial frame of the rocket at release. This means that no reflection of energy due to a mismatch of ionospheric conductivity and the characteristic impedance of an impinging Alfv\u00e9n wave was observed. It is this finding that has never been properly interpreted. Furthermore, after a careful assessment of the barium cloud properties and environmental parameters, we find a theoretical coupling time to the ambient flow which turns out to be substantially longer than observed. Although this appears to indicate that some interaction with the ionosphere occurred, we can rule out multiple wave reflections during the observed acceleration phase. Discarding other possibilities, we interpret the observed motions as sign of perfect matching of the momentum and energy flux into the ionosphere with the rate of dissipation. This is achieved during the initial phase by scale breaking of the cloud into streaks with narrow widths which allow parallel potential drops along the Alfv\u00e9n wings because of the waves' inertial nature and inside the lower ionosphere owing to the finite parallel resistivity, thereby greatly reducing the effective Pedersen conductivity. The significance of this finding goes beyond understanding the barium injection experiment. It sheds light on how magnetospheric plasma irregularities can share momentum and energy with the ionosphere in an optimized fashion.",

         "abstract": "This paper describes a novel method for quantitatively and routinely identifying auroral breakup following substorm onset using the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms all-sky imagers. Substorm onset is characterized by a brightening of the aurora that is followed by auroral poleward expansion and auroral breakup. This breakup can be identified by a sharp increase in the auroral intensity i(t) and the time derivative of auroral intensity i(t). Utilizing both i(t) and i'(t), we have developed an algorithm for identifying the time interval and spatial location of auroral breakup during the substorm expansion phase based solely on quantifiable characteristics of the optical auroral emissions. We compare the time interval determined by the algorithm to independently identified auroral onset times from three previously published studies. In each case the time interval determined by the algorithm is within error of the onset independently identified by the prior studies. We further show the utility of the algorithm by comparing the breakup intervals determined using the automated algorithm to an independent list of substorm onset times. We demonstrate that 50% of the breakup intervals characterized by the algorithm are within the uncertainty of the times identified in the list. The quantitative description and routine identification of an interval of auroral brightening during the substorm expansion phase provides a foundation for unbiased statistical analysis of the aurora and to probe the physics of the auroral substorm and identify the processes leading to auroral substorm onset.",

Atomic Oxygen from WACCM-X has maxima at solstices and summer mid-high latitudes, similar to [O] from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER). We use the densities and dynamics from WACCM-X to drive the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) at its lower boundary and compare it with the MSIS driven GITM. We focus on the differences in the modeling of the thermospheric and ionospheric semiannual oscillation (T-I SAO). Our results reveal that driving GITM with WACCM-X causes the T-I SAO to maximize around solstices, opposite to when MSIS is used. This is because the global mixing in GITM during solstices is not strong enough to decrease the solstitial [O] densities below the equinoctial values between mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and upper thermosphere. Larger summer [O] in the MLT leads to the accumulation of [O] at lower latitudes in the thermosphere due to weaker meridional transport, which further increases the amplitude of the oppositely phased SAO. WACCM-X itself has the right phase of SAO in the upper thermosphere but wrong at lower altitudes. The exact mechanisms that can correct the phase of T-I SAO in GITM while using SABER-like [O] in the MLT are currently unknown and warrant further investigation. We suggest mechanisms that can reduce the solstitial maxima in the lower thermosphere, for example, stronger interhemispheric meridional winds, stronger residual circulation, seasonal variations in eddy diffusion, and momentum from breaking gravity waves.",

The striking variations of simultaneous solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF-B<SUB>z</SUB> were not observed. Furthermore, we found that this IMF-B<SUB>x</SUB> discontinuity was a heliospheric current sheet, separating two high-speed solar wind streams with different velocity and magnetic polarity. In this study, the magnetic field and plasma data were obtained from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), Cluster, and GOES to investigate the magnetospheric responses, and those were taken from ACE and Geotail to monitor the solar wind conditions. Simultaneous geomagnetic field variations from the ground observatories and aurora activity from Polar were also examined. When the discontinuity encountered the magnetosphere, THEMIS-D, -E, and THEMIS-A observed abrupt and transient magnetic field and plasma variations in the dawnside near-Earth magnetotail and tail-flank magnetopause. Significant magnetic field perturbations were not observed by Cluster as located in the duskside magnetotail at this time interval. Although simultaneous dipolarization and negative bay variations with Pi2 waves were observed by GOES and the ground observatories, global auroral activities were not found. Around the dawnside tail-flank magnetopause, THEMIS-C and -A experienced the magnetopause crossings due to the magnetopause surface waves induced by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These results suggest that the magnetic field and plasma variations in the near-Earth magnetotail and tail-flank magnetopause were caused by moderate substorm-like phenomena and magnetopause surface waves.

         "abstract": "Although energetic particle injections during substorms have been observed near geosynchronous orbit since the late 1960s, how the injected particles are accelerated during a substorm is still not fully understood. Studies show that injections are associated with earthward propagating dipolarization fronts and suggest that particle acceleration can occur due to a combination of betatron acceleration during earthward convection and acceleration in the vicinity of magnetotail reconnection sites. Since observed energetic particle distributions vary from substorm to substorm, it is important to study acceleration mechanisms as a function of different substorm magnetotail configurations. In this paper, we discuss electron acceleration for two substorm events featuring different magnetotail configurations and particle acceleration processes. The study utilizes in situ observations, global MHD simulations, and large-scale-kinetic (LSK) simulations. The two substorms in question occurred on 15 February 2008 and 15 August 2001. The 15 February 2008 event was observed by the THEMIS spacecraft at x<SUB>GSE</SUB> ~ -10 R<SUB>E</SUB>, while the 15 August 2001 event was observed by Cluster spacecraft at x<SUB>GSE</SUB> ~ -20 R<SUB>E</SUB>. Earthward propagating dipolarization fronts are found in both the observations and the MHD simulations, which are driven by the solar wind conditions that existed during those events. The two simulations show that very different magnetotail configurations are formed for each event, with contrasting flows, magnetic reconnection configuration, and plasma sheet structure. We find that for the 15 February 2008 event reconnection is localized with a narrow region of high-speed flow. During this event, the electron velocity distribution functions f(v) are found to be anisotropic with f(v<SUB>\u22a5</SUB>) &gt; f(v<SUB>||</SUB>), where || and \u22a5 correspond to parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field. In contrast, for the 15 August 2001 event, there is a wide neutral line extending across the tail with low-speed flows. For this event, the distribution functions are anisotropic with f(v<SUB>||</SUB>) &gt; f(v<SUB>\u22a5</SUB>), the opposite sense as the 15 February 2008 event. We are able to relate these differences to the different magnetotail configurations seen during each event. These differences lead to contrasting occurrence rates of nonadiabatic acceleration. The differences between the magnetotail configurations during these two substorms may result from differences in the location of dayside reconnection. On 15 August 2001 the reconnection occurs on the flanks of the magnetopause, while on 15 February 2008 the reconnection occurs nearer the subsolar point.",

In this study, we analyze more than two hundred magnetopause crossing events using the energetic electron and magnetic field measurements from Geotail and compare the flux and phase space density (PSD) of the energetic electrons on both sides of the magnetopause. It is found that for most of the events (&gt;70%), the fluxes and PSDs of energetic electrons in the magnetosheath are less than those in the magnetosphere, suggesting that the energetic electrons in the magnetosheath cannot be a direct source sufficient for the energetic electrons inside the magnetosphere. In fact, our analysis suggests a possible leakage of the energetic electrons from inside to outside the magnetopause. By investigating the average energetic electron flux distribution in the magnetosheath, we find that the energetic electron fluxes are higher near the bow shock and the magnetopause than in between. The high energetic electron flux near the bow shock can be understood as due to energization of electrons when they go through the bow shock. The relatively low flux of the energetic electrons in between indicates that it is difficult for the energetic electrons to travel from the bow shock to the magnetopause and vice versa, possibly because the energetic electrons near the bow shock and the magnetopause are all on open magnetic field lines and these two relatively intense energetic electron populations in the magnetosheath rarely get mixed.",

         "abstract": "We reproduced the substorm by global simulation and analyzed the development of convection, shear, the dynamo, and the field-aligned current (FAC) at the final stage of the growth phase. From these investigations, we show that the substorm is a manifestation of reconfiguration in global flow dynamics. Ionospheric convection can be understood from two aspects. One understanding is as the potential field generated by the FAC, and the other is as the projection of magnetospheric convection. In order for the two to coincide, the FAC must be transmitted together with the motion. As a consequence, the resulting convection must be continuous from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. We see this connection from the drawing of shear to recognize that the substorm is the projection process of transient convection. In the growth phase, convective shear that causes the quiet arc and the Harang reversal (HR) occurs on the open/closed boundary along the surface of the plasma sheet with a continuous flow structure from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. The onset starts from a more local flow that is induced by the near-earth neutral line (NENL). A narrow shear commences from the NENL in the mid-tail and extends to the ionosphere to replace growth phase shear. Along a closed magnetic field line connected to the NENL, direct penetration flow, squeezing flow, the near-earth dynamo, release of the HR, and the onset FAC occur successively and consequently cause the ground onset. Such onset mechanism is quite different from the model adopting the current wedge.",

         "abstract": "We investigated energy flow in the inner magnetosphere on the basis of the results obtained by a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation. When the magnetosphere is exposed to a southward interplanetary magnetic field, the magnetosphere undergoes quasi-steady convection. Downward (earthward) Poynting flux is found in the polar cap, which is consistent with previous observations. However, Poynting flux appears to be upward (antiearthward) in the equatorward region of the auroral oval. The Region 2 field-aligned current (FAC) is embedded in the upward Poynting flux region. The upward Poynting flux is closely associated with space charge deposited by the ionospheric Hall current under inhomogeneous ionospheric conductivity. The space charge gives rise to shear flow of plasma, which is transmitted upward to the magnetosphere. The shear flow generates additional Region 2 FAC, at least, in the low-altitude magnetosphere. Spatial distribution of the Region 2 FAC appears to depend on altitude, suggesting the significant influence of the ionosphere in the Region 2 FAC region. We traced integral curves of Poynting flux (S curves) backward from a magnetic field line in the Region 2 FAC region and found that the S curves originate either in the solar wind and in the earthward-most boundary of the simulation. These simulation results suggest that the ionosphere participates in the generation of the Region 2 FAC, and the ionosphere is a mediator to feed energy to the inner magnetosphere under the quasi-steady convection.",

The electromagnetic field is excited by a large-scale 50/150 Hz oscillating linear current suspended above the ground. The elaborated model is based on numerical solution of full-wave equations in a realistic ionosphere whose parameters have been reconstructed with the use of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. The PLE wave beam in the ionosphere is not guided by B<SUB>0</SUB>, but still is shifted equatorward from the vertical. The response of the nightside upper ionosphere is slowly decreasing with diminishing of latitude. The amplitude of PLE electric component in the upper ionosphere generated by the unbalanced power line current with intensity of \u223c10 Amperes can reach \u223c1 \u03bcV/m which is sufficient to be detected by a low-Earth-orbit satellite.

         "abstract": "The relationship between monoenergetic electron acceleration and broadband electron acceleration is uncertain, although some have speculated that the latter is a temporal transient, and may evolve into the former. Here we have taken advantage of DMSP satellite coincidences to investigate the issue. We consider 1668 cases where one DMSP satellite observed an electron acceleration event covering at least 2 s, hence as many discrete accelerated spectra, and a second satellite subsequently observed an electron acceleration at the same location. The spatial coincidence required was tight, with a maximum separation of 0.1\u00b0 magnetic latitude and 0.15 h magnetic local time. Time separations of 0-10 min were considered in 1 min bins, with auroral acceleration flagged as either monoenergetic, broadband, or a mixture of both. Within the first temporal bin (0-1 min), the second satellite had a high probability of observing the same type of aurora as the first, establishing consistency. When the first satellite observed monoenergetic aurora, the second satellite also observed monoenergetic aurora (about 80% of the time), and this continued to up to about 10 min of UT separation. In most of the other 20% of the cases, the second satellite also recorded monoenergetic acceleration but with an additional mixture of broadband acceleration. Thus monoenergetic aurora does not seem to typically evolve on a time scale of minutes. However, when the first satellite encounter was with broadband acceleration, the second encounter was highly time-dependent, with broadband dominating the second satellite encounter only in the 0-1 min bin. Between 1 and 5 min, the probability of observing a mixture of auroral types jumped, and after 6 min, the auroral acceleration was nearly as likely to be monoenergetic as broadband. Finally, if the first satellite encountered a mixture of acceleration, the second encounter was progressively more likely to be entirely monoenergetic aurora as time increased. These results are consistent with the idea that broadband aurora may be inherently a transient, and often progresses to monoenergetic aurora, while the latter is quasi-static.",

         "abstract": "The most dynamic electromagnetic coupling between the magnetosphere and ionosphere occurs in the polar upper atmosphere. It is critical to quantify the electromagnetic energy and momentum input associated with this coupling as its impacts on the ionosphere and thermosphere system are global and major, often leading to considerable disturbances in near-Earth space environments. The current general circulation models of the upper atmosphere exhibit systematic biases that can be attributed to an inadequate representation of the Joule heating rate resulting from unaccounted stochastic fluctuations of electric fields associated with the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. These biases exist regardless of geomagnetic activity levels. To overcome this limitation, a new multiresolution random field modeling approach is developed, and the efficacy of the approach is demonstrated using Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) data carefully curated for the study during a largely quiet 4-hour period on February 29, 2012. Regional small-scale electrostatic fields sampled at different resolutions from a probabilistic distribution of electric field variability conditioned on actual SuperDARN LOS observations exhibit considerably more localized fine-scale features in comparison to global large-scale fields modeled using the SuperDARN Assimilative Mapping procedure. The overall hemispherically integrated Joule heating rate is increased by a factor of about 1.5 due to the effect of random regional small-scale electric fields, which is close to the lower end of arbitrarily adjusted Joule heating multiplicative factor of 1.5 and 2.5 typically used in upper atmosphere general circulation models. The study represents an important step toward a data-driven ensemble modeling of magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling processes.",

         "abstract": "Harang discontinuity is a longitudinally extended ionospheric signature near midnight of flow reversal from westward to eastward with decreasing latitude. Its occurrence indicates enhanced convection in the magnetotail that requires an upward field-aligned current from the ionosphere due to diamagnetic ion drift. Previous reports using event studies have been conflicting as to the occurrence of the Harang discontinuity during a mode of enhanced magnetotail response called steady magnetospheric convection (SMC). With a comprehensive list of SMC events from 1997 through 2007, we utilize data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network and a novel spatial superposition technique to statistically examine the occurrence of the Harang discontinuity during SMC events. We find that the statistical signature of the Harang discontinuity begins before SMC starts and strengthens as the SMC events progress. We also detail the typical size and strength of the Harang discontinuity and find that it is more pronounced during interplanetary magnetic field +B<SUB>y</SUB> conditions.",

         "abstract": "The long-term variation of the Amp\u00e8re force exerted by geomagnetic Sq currents was studied in relation to the thermospheric pressure. First, the long-term trend of the pressure difference was estimated using a linear regression coefficient based on a high correlation between the Amp\u00e8re force and the pressure difference in recent years. The pressure difference may be inferred from solar parameters such as solar sunspot number; inspection of the difference from Sq has a merit that it gives the \"response\" of the thermosphere in contrast with the \"input\" parameters of the solar activity index. Next, the effect of the version up of sunspot number was examined. The correlation of the Amp\u00e8re force with sunspot number updated in 2015 (version 2) is slightly higher than that with old sunspot number (version 1), which suggests that the later version is an improved index for the solar activity and its effect on the state of the thermosphere. Last, the correlation between total Sq currents and sunspot number was found to be less than that between the Amp\u00e8re force and sunspot number, although the difference is small and could not be statistically significant. This suggests that the geomagnetic main field affects the relation between the Amp\u00e8re force and the pressure difference.",

         "abstract": "Nonmigrating tides are a major coupling mechanism between the different regions of the atmosphere and ionosphere. The wave number 4 (WN4) pattern in the ionosphere has been recognized as originating primarily with the diurnal eastward propagating wave-3 nonmigrating tide (DE3) in the troposphere, and significant effort has been devoted in recent years to understanding how tidal effects manifest in various physical parameters across a very wide range of altitudes. While DE3 and WN4 signatures have been much studied in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere region, relatively little is known about how WN4 impacts the ionosphere above the F peak. We present an analysis of WN4 in the topside ionosphere as measured by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft, using monthly averages of total ion densities and composition binned by latitude and longitude. We found that WN4 is most strongly present during September equinox. In May-August, ion densities near 180-270 geographic longitude (GLON) are enhanced and the WN4 pattern moves 5-10\u00b0 north; in November-February, ion densities are reduced in this region and WN4 moves 5-10\u00b0 south. No solar cycle effects were found in the magnitude of dN/N. The longitude position of the peaks (phase) was observed to vary by about 10\u00b0 with F10.7, moving eastward with increasing F10.7. The latitude variation was less than 5\u00b0 and did not show a trend with F10.7. The WN4 pattern changes rapidly near dawn but is very constant throughout the afternoon and evening in terms of dN/N and drifts eastward at about 2\u00b0 GLON per hour magnetic local time.",

         "abstract": "We describe the Mars ionosphere with unprecedented detail in 3-D, as simulated by a Mars general circulation model (the Laboratoire de M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Dynamique Mars GCM), and compare it with recent measurements. The model includes a number of recent extensions and improvements. Different simulations for a full Martian year have been performed. The electron density at the main ionospheric peak is shown to vary with the Sun-Mars distance and with the solar variability, both in the long-term (11 year solar cycle) and on shorter temporal scales (solar rotation). The main electronic peak is shown to be located at the same pressure level during all the Martian year. As a consequence, its altitude varies with latitude, local time, and season according to the natural expansions and fluctuations of the neutral atmosphere, in agreement with previous models. The model predicts a nighttime ionosphere due only to photochemistry. The simulated ionosphere close to the evening terminator is in agreement with observations. No effort has been made to explain the patchy ionosphere observed in the deep nightside. We have compared the modeled ionosphere with Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding data. The model reproduces the solar zenith angle variability of the electron density and the altitude of the peak, although it underestimates the electron density at the main peak by about 20%. The electron density at the secondary peak is strongly underestimated by the model, probably due to a very crude representation of the X-ray solar flux. This is one of the aspects that needs a revision in future versions of the model.",

         "abstract": "Electron temperatures are a key parameter for understanding the ionosphere-thermosphere system. This study uses in situ data from the MAVEN mission to investigate the level of coupling between the Martian ionospheric electrons and the neutral thermosphere below the altitude of 190 km. Such coupling is responsible for significant diurnal variations and dawn/dusk asymmetries in both the neutral and plasma portions of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. Earlier theoretical studies suggested that neutral species controlled the electron temperature by collisional cooling thus implying a diurnal trend in electron temperatures due to the diurnal variability of the neutrals. This hypothesis is evaluated across the dayside ionosphere in the present work. Observations of neutral densities confirm that neutral-electron collisions are the primary process controlling the cooling of electrons in the Martian ionosphere below 190 km. The consequence of this is that electron temperatures can be anticorrelated with the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance due to enhanced electron cooling brought about by an expansion of neutral densities. The results also indicate that in the afternoon sector, neutral densities are less responsive to changes in EUV. This might be associated with enhanced winds leading to dynamic cooling that mitigates the thermal expansion of the thermosphere in the afternoon region. Subsequently, the electron temperature as a function of EUV is relatively uncorrelated in the afternoon sector.",

These pickup ions, generated by photoionization of neutral species while the Moon is in the magnetotail lobes, undergo acceleration from both the magnetotail convection electric field and the lunar surface photoelectric field, giving rise to distinct pickup ion flux, pitch angle, and energy distributions. By simulating the behavior of lunar pickup ions in the magnetotail lobes and the response of the twin ARTEMIS probes under various ambient conditions, we can constrain several physical quantities associated with these observations, including the source ion production rate and the magnetotail convection velocity (and hence, electric field). Using the model-derived source ion production rate and established photoionization rates, we present upper limits on the density of several species potentially in the lunar exosphere. In certain cases, these limits are lower than those previously reported. We also present evidence that the lunar exosphere is displaced toward the lunar dawnside while in the terrestrial magnetotail based on fits to the observed pickup ion distributions.",

         "abstract": "Two important source reactions for hot atomic carbon on Mars are photodissociation of CO and dissociative recombination of CO<SUP>+</SUP>; both reactions are highly sensitive to solar activity and occur mostly deep in the dayside thermosphere. The production of energetic particles results in the formation of hot coronae that are made up of neutral atoms including hot carbon. Some of these atoms are on ballistic trajectories and return to the thermosphere, and others escape. Understanding the physics in this region requires modeling that captures the complicated dynamics of hot atoms in 3-D. This study evaluates the carbon atom inventory by investigating the production and distribution of energetic carbon atoms using the full 3-D atmospheric input. The methodology and details of the hot atomic carbon model calculation are given, and the calculated total global escape of hot carbon from the assumed dominant photochemical processes at a fixed condition, equinox (L<SUB>s</SUB> = 180\u00b0), and low solar activity (F10.7 = 70 at Earth) are presented. To investigate the dynamics of these energetic neutral atoms, we have coupled a self-consistent 3-D global kinetic model, the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator, with a 3-D thermosphere/ionosphere model, the Mars Thermosphere General Circulation Model to provide a self-consistent global description of the hot carbon corona in the upper thermosphere and exosphere. The spatial distributions of density and temperature and atmospheric loss are simulated for the case considered.",

         "abstract": "Thermal history models, historically used to understand Earth's geologic history, are being coupled to climate models to map conditions that allow planets to maintain life. However, the lack of structural uncertainty assessment has blurred guidelines for how thermal history models can be used toward this end. Structural uncertainty is intrinsic to the modeling process. Model structure refers to the cause and effect relations that define a model and are assumed to adequately represent a particular real world system. Intrinsic/structural uncertainty is different from input and parameter uncertainties (which are often evaluated for thermal history models). A full uncertainty assessment requires that input/parametric and intrinsic/structural uncertainty be evaluated (one is not a substitute for the other). We quantify the intrinsic uncertainty for several parameterized thermal history models (a subclass of planetary models). We use single perturbation analysis to determine the reactance time of different models. This provides a metric for how long it takes low-amplitude, unmodeled effects to decay or grow. Reactance time is shown to scale inversely with the strength of the dominant model feedback (negative or positive). A perturbed physics analysis is then used to determine uncertainty shadows for model outputs. This provides probability distributions for model predictions. It also tests the structural stability of a model (do model predictions remain qualitatively similar, and within assumed model limits, in the face of intrinsic uncertainty?). Once intrinsic uncertainty is accounted for, model outputs/predictions and comparisons to observational data should be treated in a probabilistic way.",

This review is concerned with those sunspot observations of which longer records and drawings in particular are available. Those records bear information beyond the classical sunspot numbers or group sunspot numbers. We begin with a brief summary on naked-eye sunspot observations, in particular those with drawings. They are followed by the records of drawings from 1610 to about 1900. The review is not a compilation of all known historical sunspot information. Some records contributing substantially to the sunspot number time series may therefore be absent. We also glance at the evolution of the understanding of what sunspots actually are, from 1610 to the 19th century. The final part of the review illuminates the physical quantities that can be derived from historical drawings.",

         "abstract": "We report the results of a study on the movement of the solar wind diamagnetic structure (DS), which is a sequence of smaller-scale microDS being part of the May 18, 2013 coronal mass ejection, from a source on the Sun to Earth's surface. DS determined from the high negative correlation coefficient (r=-0.9) between the IMF modulus (B) and the SW density (N) on the ACE and Wind satellites at the L1 point, on the THB and THC satellites (r=-0.9) in near-Earth orbit, and on the THA satellite inside the magnetosphere is carried by the solar wind from the Sun to Earth's orbit, while maintaining its fine internal structure. Having a large size in the radial direction (\u224d763 R\u1d07, where R\u1d07 is the Earth radius), DS flows around the magnetosphere. At the same time, microDS of size \u226413 R\u1d07 passes through the bow shock and magnetopause as a magnetized plasmoid in which the ion concentration increases from 10 cm\u207b\u00b3 to 90 cm\u207b\u00b3, and the velocity decreases as it moves toward the magnetotail. When a microDS passes through the magnetopause, a pulsed electric field of ~400 mV/m is generated with subsequent oscillations with a period of T~200 s and an amplitude of ~50 mV/m. The electric field accelerates charged particles of the radiation belt and produces modulated fluxes of protons in an energy range 95-575 keV on the day side and electrons in 40-475 keV and protons in 95-575 keV on the night side. In the duskside magnetosphere (19-23 MLT), the substorm activation is observed in geomagnetic pulsations and auroras, but without a magnetic negative bay. In the post-midnight sector (01-05 MLT), a sawtooth substorm occurs without the growth phase and breakup with deep modulation of the ionospheric current and auroral absorption. The duration of all phenomena in the magnetosphere and on Earth is determined by the period of interaction between DS and the magnetosphere (~4 hrs). To interpret the regularities of the magnetospheric response to the interaction with DS, we consider alternative models of the impulsive passage of DS from SW to the magnetosphere and the classical model of reconnection of IMF and the geomagnetic field.",

We have constructed scatter plots and have computed correlation relationships between parameters relating to different levels of atmosphere. We have obtained the following results. The intensities observed in the lower and middle chromosphere are connected closer than intensities related to the upper photosphere and middle chromosphere. The structures with a stronger magnetic field are brighter at the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere levels as compared to the structures with a weaker magnetic field. K<SUB>1</SUB> minima separations are of greater value for the structures with a stronger magnetic field relative to the structures with a weaker magnetic field, whereas K<SUB>2</SUB> peaks separations demonstrate the opposite behavior. They are lower for the structures with a stronger magnetic field. It is true not only for the chosen structures belonging to quiet regions but also for the plage, though we need additional statistics for plages. The relation between shifts of K<SUB>1</SUB> minima and K<SUB>2</SUB> peak intensities for violet and red wings appeared to be weak. This may be due to the considerable contribution of random movements to the velocity field at the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere levels or due to different forming levels for the profile violet and red wings.</SUB>",

         "abstract": "We study the Pi3 pulsations (with a period T=15-30 min) that were recorded on December 8, 2017 at ground stations in the midnight sector of the magnetosphere at the latitude range of DP2 current system convective electrojets. We have found that Pi3 are especially pronounced in the pre-midnight sector with amplitude of up to 300 nT and duration of up to 2.5 hrs. The pulsation amplitude rapidly decreased with decreasing latitude from F'=72\u00b0 to F'=63\u00b0. The event was recorded during the steady magnetospheric convection. In the southward Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field, irregular oscillations were detected in the Pi3 frequency range. They correspond to slow magnetosonic waves occurring without noticeable variations in the dynamic pressure Pd. Ground-based geomagnetic observations have shown azimuthal propagation of pulsations with a 0.6-10.6 km/s velocity east and west of the midnight meridian. An analysis of the dynamics of pulsations along the meridian has revealed their propagation to the equator at a velocity 0.75-7.87 km/s. In the projection onto the magnetosphere, the velocities are close in magnitude to the observed propagation velocities of substorm injected electrons. In the dawn-side magnetosphere during ground-observed Pi3 pulsations, compression mode oscillations were recorded. We conclude that propagation of geomagnetic field oscillations in this event depends on the dynamics of particle injections under the action of a large-scale electric field of magnetospheric convection, which causes the plasma to move to Earth due to reconnection in the magnetotail. Small-scale oscillations in the magnetosphere were secondary, excited by the solar wind oscillations penetrating into the magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "The layering of the ionosphere leads to the formation of resonators and waveguides of various kinds. One of the most well-known is the ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator (IAR) whose radiation can be observed both on Earth's surface and in space in the form of a fan-shaped set of discrete spectral bands (DSB), the frequency of which changes smoothly during the day. The bands are formed by Alfv\u00e9n waves trapped between the lower part of the ionosphere and the altitude profile bending of Alfv\u00e9n velocity in the transition region between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. Thus, IAR is one of the important mechanisms of the ionosphere-magnetosphere interaction. The emission frequency lies in the range from tenths of hertz to about 8 Hz \u2014 the frequency of the first harmonic of the Schumann resonance. The review describes in detail the morphology of the phenomenon. It is emphasized that the IAR emission is a permanent phenomenon; the probability of observing it is primarily determined by the sensitivity of the equipment and the absence of interference of natural and artificial origin. The daily duration of the DSB observation almost completely depends on the illumination conditions of the lower ionosphere: the bands are clearly visible only when the D layer is shaded. Numerous theoretical IAR models have been systematized. All of them are based on the analysis of the excitation and propagation of Alfv\u00e9n waves in inhomogeneous ionospheric plasma and differ mainly in sources of oscillation generation and methods of accounting for various factors such as interaction of wave modes, dipole geometry of the magnetic field, frequency dispersion of waves. Predicted by all models of the cavity and repeatedly confirmed experimentally, the close relationship between DSB frequency variations and critical frequency foF2 variations serves as the basis for searching ways of determining in real time the electron density of the ionosphere from IAR emission frequency measurements. It is also possible to estimate the profile of the ion composition over the ionosphere from the data on the IAR emission frequency structure. The review also focuses on other results from a wide range of IAR studies, specifically on the results that revealed the influence of the interplanetary magnetic field orien tation on oscillations of the resonator, and on the facts of the influence of seismic disturbances on IAR.",

It interacted with Earth's magnetosphere under conditions when the northward Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) remained for a long time in preceding undisturbed SW. The interaction and a sharp change in the direction of Bz to the south generated an isolated substorm whose duration depends on the duration of interaction with the DS. The substorm began at midday with the passage of the DS into the magnetosphere and spread to the east. All phases of the substorm \u2014 growth, expansion, and recovery \u2014 were observed for two hours. Variations in the SW and IMF parameters are shown to coincide for the isolated substorm whose energy source was the slow solar wind DS, and a trigger was the abrupt change in the direction of the vertical IMF component from north to south. The coincidence is justified by statistical generalizations of the same parameters in 40 % of cases of long-term observations of individual substorms whose trigger was a change in Bz direction.",

         "abstract": "The importance of the Jovian thermosphere with regard to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is often neglected in magnetospheric physics. We present the first study to investigate the response of the Jovian thermosphere to transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure, using an azimuthally symmetric global circulation model coupled to a simple magnetosphere and fixed auroral conductivity model. In our simulations, the Jovian magnetosphere encounters a solar wind shock or rarefaction region and is subsequently compressed or expanded. We present the ensuing response of the coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling terms, and the aurora to these transient events. Transient compressions cause the reversal, with respect to steady state, of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents and momentum transfer between the thermosphere and magnetosphere. They also cause at least a factor of two increase in the Joule heating rate. Ion drag significantly changes the kinetic energy of the thermospheric neutrals depending on whether the magnetosphere is compressed or expanded. Local temperature variations appear between ~-45 and 175 K for the compression scenario and ~-20 and 50 K for the expansion case. Extended regions of equatorward flow develop in the wake of compression events - we discuss the implications of this behaviour for global energy transport. Both compressions and expansions lead to a ~2000 TW increase in the total power dissipated or deposited in the thermosphere. In terms of auroral processes, transient compressions increase main oval UV emission by a factor of ~4.5 whilst transient expansions increase this main emission by a more modest 37%. Both types of transient event cause shifts in the position of the main oval, of up to 1\u00b0 latitude.",

         "abstract": "Strong ultraviolet radiation from the Sun ionizes the upper atmosphere of Venus, creating a dense ionosphere on the dayside of the planet. In contrast to Earth, the ionosphere of Venus is not protected against the solar wind by a magnetic field. However, the interaction between charged ionospheric particles and the solar wind dynamic and magnetic pressure creates a pseudo-magnetosphere which deflects the solar wind flow around the planet ( Schunk and Nagy, 1980). The combination of changing solar radiation and solar wind intensities leads to a highly variable structure and plasma composition of the ionosphere. The instrumentation of the Venus Express spacecraft allows to measure the magnetic field (MAG experiment) as well as the electron energy spectrum and the ion composition (ASPERA-4 experiment) of the upper ionosphere and ionopause. In contrast to the earlier Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) measurements which were conducted during solar maximum, the solar activity was very low in the period 2006-2009. A comparison with PVO allows for an investigation of ionospheric properties under different solar wind and EUV radiation conditions. Observations of MAG and ASPERA have been analyzed to determine the positions of the photoelectron boundary (PEB) and the \"magnetopause\" and their dependence on the solar zenith angle (SZA). The PEB was determined using the ELS observations of ionospheric photoelectrons, which can be identified by their specific energy range. It is of particular interest to explore the different magnetic states of the ionosphere, since these influence the local plasma conductivity, currents and probably the escape of electrons and ions. The penetration of magnetic fields into the ionosphere depends on the external conditions as well as on the ionospheric properties. By analyzing a large number of orbits, using a combination of two different methods, we define criteria to distinguish between the so-called magnetized and unmagnetized ionospheric states. Furthermore, we confirm that the average magnetic field inside the ionosphere shows a linear dependence on the magnetic field in the region directly above the PEB.",

         "abstract": "The historical Hungarian auroral record extends from 1523 to 1960 and is longer than the sunspot record. Harmonic analysis reveals four major multidecadal secular cycles forming an approximate harmonic set at periods of 42.85, 57.13, 85.7 and 171.4 years. These four frequencies are very close to the four major heliospheric oscillations relative to the center of mass of the solar system caused by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Similar frequencies are found in solar radiation models based on long cosmogenic isotope records (Steinhilber et al., 2012) and in long records of naked-eye sunspot observations (Vaquero et al., 2002). Harmonic regression models are used to reconstruct and forecast aurora and solar activity for the period 1956-2050. The model predicts: (1) the multidecadal solar minimum in the 1970s that is also observed in the sunspot record; (2) a solar maximum in 2000-2002 that is observed in the ACRIM total solar irradiance satellite composite; (3) a prolonged solar minimum centered in the 2030s. These findings support a hypothesis that the Sun, the heliosphere and the terrestrial magnetosphere are partially modulated by planetary gravitational and magnetic forces synchronized to planetary oscillations, as also found in other recent publications (Scafetta, 2010, 2012a, 2012c, 2012d; Abreu et al., 2012; Tan and Cheng, 2012).",

We analyze the Lyman-\u03b1 emission from four HST campaigns in order to constrain the abundance and variation of atomic hydrogen in Ganymede's atmosphere. We apply a forward model that estimates surface reflection and resonant scattering in an escaping corona of the solar Lyman-\u03b1 flux, taking into account the effects of the hydrogen in the interplanetary medium. The atmospheric emissions around Ganymede's disk derived for the observations taken between 1998 and 2011 are consistent with a hydrogen corona in the density range of (5-8) \u00d7 10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> at the surface. The hydrogen density appears to be generally stable in that period. In 2014, Ganymede's corona brightness is approximately 3 times lower during two observations of Ganymede's trailing hemisphere and hardly detectable at all during two observations of the leading hemisphere. We also investigate extinction of Ganymede's coronal emissions in the Earth's upper atmosphere or geocorona. For small Doppler shifts, resonant scattering in the geocorona of the moon corona emissions can effectively reduce the brightness observed by HST. In the case of the 2014 leading hemisphere observations, an estimated extinction of 80% might explain the non-detection of Ganymede's hydrogen corona. Geocoronal extinction might also explain a previously detected hemispheric difference from Callisto's hydrogen corona.",

         "abstract": "In two previous papers (Dubinin et al., 2016, 2017a) we studied the influence of the crustal magnetic field and solar irradiance on the upper ionosphere of Mars based on the observations made on Mars Express. Here we discuss effects of solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field using the MAVEN observations. It is shown that the upper ionosphere at solar zenith angles \u2265 \u223c40<SUP>o</SUP> and altitudes above \u223c 350 - 400 km is asymmetrical along the direction of the motional electric field. In the hemisphere, in which the motional electric field is directed toward the planet, the ionosphere is denser and expands to higher altitudes as compared to the ionosphere in the opposite hemisphere. The difference in the density of O<SUP>+</SUP> and O<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> ions in both hemispheres achieves almost one order. Such a difference arises due to a different ion convection. Ion convection in both ionospheres occurs in the same direction as the motion of the shocked solar wind in the adjacent magnetosheath although with very different velocities. The upper ionosphere is also sensitive to the variations in the solar wind dynamic pressure, solar wind flux and the value of the motional electric field with a distinct depletion at altitudes above \u223c 450 - 500 km with increase of these solar wind characteristics. The depletion is accompanied by an increase in the horizontal ion velocities. As a result, the ion fluxes to the tail only insignificantly vary with the modest variations of the solar wind characteristics.",

         "abstract": "We have investigated MESSENGER magnetic field data from the Mercury magnetosheath and near solar wind, to identify isolated magnetic field structures (defined as clear, isolated changes in the field magnitude). Their properties are studied in order to determine if they may be considered as analogues to plasmoids and jets known to exist in Earth's magnetosheath. Both isolated decreases of the magnetic field absolute value ('negative magnetic field structures') and increases ('positive structures') are found in the magnetosheath, whereas only negative structures are found in the solar wind. The similar properties of the solar wind and magnetosheath negative magnetic field structures suggests that they are analogous to diamagnetic plasmoids found in Earth's magnetosheath and near solar wind. The latter have earlier been identified with solar wind magnetic holes. Positive magnetic field structures are only found in the magnetosheath, concentrated to a region relatively close to the magnetopause. Their proximity to the magnetopause, their scale sizes, and the association of a majority of the structures with bipolar magnetic field signatures identify them as flux transfer events (which generally are associated with a decrease of plasma density in the magnetosheath). The positive magnetic field structures are therefore not likely to be analogous to terrestrial paramagnetic plasmoids but possibly to a sub-population of magnetosheath jets. At Earth, a majority of magnetosheath jets are associated with the quasi-parallel bow shock. We discuss some consequences of the findings of the present investigation pertaining to the different nature of the quasi-parallel bow shock at Mercury and Earth.",

The strength of these emissions is dependent on the difference in speed of the rotational flows within Jupiter's high-latitude thermosphere and the planet's magnetodisc. Using an azimuthally symmetric global circulation model, we have simulated how upstream solar wind conditions affect the energy and direction of atmospheric flows. In order to simulate the effect of a varying dynamic pressure in the upstream solar wind, we calculated three magnetic field profiles representing compressed, averaged and expanded \u2018middle\u2019 magnetospheres. These profiles were then used to solve for the angular velocity of plasma in the magnetosphere. This angular velocity determines the strength of currents flowing between the ionosphere and magnetosphere. We examine the influence of variability in this current system upon the global winds and energy inputs within the Jovian thermosphere. We find that the power dissipated by Joule heating and ion drag increases by \u223c190% and \u223c185% from our compressed to expanded model respectively. We investigated the effect of exterior boundary conditions on our models and found that by reducing the radial current at the outer edge of the magnetodisc, we also limit the thermosphere's ability to transmit angular momentum to this region.",

After closest approach on day of year (DOY) 58, 2007, NH followed a tailward trajectory that provided a unique opportunity to explore the deep jovian magnetotail and the surrounding magnetosheath. After DOY 132, 16 magnetopause crossings were observed between 1654 and 2429 Jupiter radii (R<SUB>j</SUB>) along the dusk flank tailward of the planet. In some cases the crossings were identified as rapid transitions from the magnetotail to the magnetosheath and vice versa. In other cases a boundary layer was observed just inside the magnetopause. Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) is an instrument on board NH that obtained spectra of low energy ions during the flyby period. We use a forward model including the SWAP instrument response to derive plasma parameters (density, temperature and velocity) which best reproduce the observations. We also vary the plasma parameters in our model in order to fit the observations more accurately on occasions where the measurements exhibit significant variability. We compare the properties of the plasma in the boundary layer with those of the magnetosheath plasma derived in our earlier work. We attempt to estimate the magnetic field in the boundary layer assuming pressure balance between it and the magnetosheath. Finally, we investigate several possible scenarios to assess if magnetopause movement and structure could cause the variations seen in the data.",

We use the measured intensity spectrum and anisotropy of energetic hydrogen and oxygen ions to detect, qualify, and quantify plasma convection. We find that the plasma azimuthal convection speed relative to the local rigid corotation speed decreases with radial distance, lagging the planetary rotation rate, and has no significant local time dependences. Plasma in the dusk-midnight quadrant sub-corotates at a large fraction of the rigid corotation speed, with the primary velocity being azimuthal but with a distinct radially outward component. The duskside velocities are similar to those obtained from earlier orbits in the midnight-dawn sector, in contrast to the depressed velocities measured at Jupiter using Energetic Particles Detector measurements on the Galileo spacecraft in the dusk-midnight quadrant. We find significant radial outflow in most of the nightside region. The radial component of the flow decreases with increasing local time in the midnight-dawn sector and reverses as dawn is approached. This and previous results are consistent with a plasma disk undergoing a centrifugally induced expansion as it emerges into the nightside, while maintaining partial rotation with the planet. The magnetodisk expansion continues as plasma rotates across the tail to the dawnside. We do not see evidence in the convection pattern for steady state reconnection in Saturn's magnetotail. The outermost region of the magnetodisk, having undergone expansion upon emerging from the dayside magnetopause confinement, is unlikely to recirculate back into the dayside. We conclude that plasma in the outer magnetodisk [at either planet] rotates from the dayside, expands at the dusk flank, but remains magnetically connected to the respective planet while moving across the tail until it interacts with and is entrained into the dawnside magnetosheath flow. This interaction causes plasma in the outer magnetospheric regions of Jupiter and Saturn to decouple from the planet and exhaust tailward down a dawnside low latitude boundary layer. Magnetospheric plasma will also interact with the dayside magnetosheath plasma, moving across the boundary [enhanced by shear instability] and into the magnetosheath, where it is lost to the magnetosphere with the magnetosheath flow.",

A model magnetotail is used in the form of a plasma cylinder which is inhomogeneous over the radius. For a qualitative analysis of the problem the solution is obtained analytically, in the WKB approximation. The plasma cylinder boundary is assumed to have the form of a tangential discontinuity. A numeric solution was found for a more realistic model, with the boundary in the form of a smooth transition layer. This model cannot simulate such a feature of the actual magnetotail as its being divided into two lobes with opposite magnetic fields. It is capable, however, of simulating the finiteness of the magnetotail cross-section and the inhomogeneous plasma distribution over the radius. It is shown, analytically, that a local instability develops in the boundary when the velocity of the plasma flowing round the magnetosphere exceeds the Alfv\u00e9n speed at the magnetotail boundary. This conclusion is supported by a numerical solution of the problem for a model with its boundary in the form of a smooth transition layer. The instability increment, however, is much smaller in the latter case. Apart from a local instability of the boundary, unstable global modes are discovered whose amplitude practically does not vary over the magnetotail cross-section. These modes remain unstable for any, however, slow velocities of the plasma flowing round the magnetosphere. When the plasma flow velocity reaches a critical magnitude the global modes of the MHD oscillations become stable. Unstable global modes may be a source of ultra-low-frequency (\u223c1mHz) oscillations observed in the Earth's nightside magnetosphere.",

In the inner magnetosphere (&lt;20R<SUB>S</SUB>, R<SUB>S</SUB> = 60268 km is the radius of Saturn), this model is constructed based on L-shell and includes dayside-nightside asymmetry, which is caused by the interaction between solar wind and Saturn's magnetosphere. This model is also adjusted for magnetodisk warping according to the seasonal variation of solar latitude. In the outer magnetosphere (&gt;20R<SUB>S</SUB>), this model is constructed based on magnetodisk coordinates and represents the sheet-like structure at magnetotail. Gaussian distribution is used to fit the data along with the perpendicular distance to the warped magnetodisk. We also include a magnetopause model to filter the flux data. Finally, the results from this model are compared with those from SATRAD (SATurn RADiation model).

However, few previous observational studies of this coupling incorporated data that extended from the solar wind to deep into the ionosphere. Here we use solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere data obtained by the Mars Express spacecraft during March/April 2010 to investigate this coupling. We focus on three case studies, each centered on a pair of ionospheric electron density profiles measured by radio occultations, where the two profiles in each pair were obtained from the same location at an interval of only a few days. We find that high dynamic pressures in the solar wind are associated with compression of the magnetosphere, heating of the magnetosheath, reduction in the vertical extent of the ionosphere, and abrupt changes in electron density at the top of the ionosphere. The first three of these associations are analogous to the behavior of the plasma environment of Venus, but the final one is not. These results reinforce the notion that changes in solar forcing influence the behaviors of all of the tightly coupled regions within the Martian plasma environment.",

         "abstract": "A very tenuous solar wind regime, following a series of large coronal mass ejections, impacted Venus during early August, 2010. STEREO-B downstream from Venus observed that the solar wind density at Earth orbit dropped to \u223c0.1 #/cm<SUP>3</SUP> and persisted at this value over 1 day. A similar low value was observed at Earth in 1999 and has attracted comprehensive attention (Lazarus, A.J., 2000. Solar physics: the day the solar wind almost disappeared. Science 287, 2172-2173.), especially its consequences on Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere (Lockwood, M., 2001. Astronomy: the day the solar wind nearly died. Nature 409, 677-679.). We now have an opportunity to examine the response of Venus' ionosphere to such a tenuous solar wind. After Venus Express spacecraft entered the ionosphere near the terminator, it continuously sampled O<SUP>+</SUP> dominated planetary plasma on the nightside till it left the optical shadow region when Venus Express was located at 2 R<SUB>V</SUB> (Venus' Radii) to the Venus center and 1.1 R<SUB>V</SUB> to the Sun-Venus line. Moreover, the O<SUP>+</SUP> speed was lower than the gravitational escape speed. We interpret this low-speed O<SUP>+</SUP> as a constituent of the extended nightside ionosphere as a consequence of long-duration (18 h) tenuous solar wind, because the very low dynamic pressure enhances the source and reduces the sink of the nightside ionosphere. Though the full extent of the nightside ionosphere is not known due to the limitation of spacecraft's trajectory, our results suggest that the global configuration of Venus' ionosphere could resemble a teardrop-shaped cometary ionosphere.",

Earth is the only planet where ground based observations can be used to study this relationship on a continuous basis. In this paper we have used radio occultation data obtained from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) for the period of 12-18 May, 2005 to address the responses of X-ray flare and CME in Total Electron Content (TEC) of E region ionosphere of Mars during a violent solar event that occurred on 13th May. It was found that the TEC increased by factors of 6 in the E region ionosphere of Mars during this flare. The response of mass ejections from the Sun's corona is registered in the E region ionosphere of Mars after \u223c38 h. Our results suggest that TEC can increase by factor of \u223c3.5-4.5 during the arrival of CME on Mars. This increase in TEC can be attributed to ionization by energetic particles associated with magnetic storms. We report that shocked waves driven by CME compressed the magnetosheath of Mars by 15 km during the magnetic storms.",

         "abstract": "MAVEN spacecraft provides new opportunities for analysis of Martian environment and physical process in near-Mars space. One of interesting regions of near-Mars space is the Martian magnetosphere that is formed from mass-loaded magnetic flux tubes. There is quite detailed knowledge of the night-side magnetosphere of Mars, however the number of publications on the dayside magnetosphere are quite limited. We analyze the plasma and magnetic structure and properties of Martian magnetosphere at strong mass-loading conditions as observed on MAVEN at Mars at the solar-zenith angle of \u223c80\u00b0 on January 4, 2015. This strong mass loading of upstream flow was apparently associated with plume ions ejected from upper part of Martian magnetosphere by the solar wind motional electric field. The magnetosphere is defined by two current layers separating it from the magnetosheath at higher altitudes and from ionosphere plasma at lower altitudes. It is characterized by dominance of planetary ions which number density increases by two orders of magnitude from upper boundary to lower one. There is approximate equipartition between magnetic, ion thermal and kinetic energies through magnetosphere. The data suggest that the boundary of the magnetosphere is in pressure equilibrium with magnetosheath flow. The total energy of ion flow above (in the magnetosheath) and below (in the region of accelerated ionospheric ions) magnetosphere exceeds the magnetic energy. The upper boundary of magnetosphere was located at the place where the ratio of heavy ions and protons number densities reached \u223c0.4. Within magnetosphere this ratio continued to rise and increased by about 2 orders of magnitude at the inner boundary of magnetosphere. The heavy ion number density profile within magnetosphere suggests that it was formed by the solar wind magnetic flux tubes that reached Mars in a narrow region near the subsolar point, and then drifted around Mars to the terminator region, mass-loaded by UV-ionized upper atmosphere neutrals during this drift.",

         "abstract": "One of the problems in reconstructing the real ionosphere from an ionogram is the occurrence of a 'valley,' where electron density decreases with altitude and make a non-monotonic profile. For the case of the Earth ionosphere, the ordinary and extraordinary ray data, accompanied with an empirical model, based on the observations, are necessary to obtain a mathematical solution for a 'valley,' such as the region between the E and F layers. MARSIS/MEX is a topside sounder designed to observe the ionosphere of Mars. Some 'valley' structures were found in the ionograms measured by MARSIS. The echoes of the extraordinary ray are not available owing to the absence of the strong magnetic field on Mars. Therefore, it is difficult to have a mathematical solution for the valleys in the Martian ionosphere. In this paper, a least square method with a simple model is presented to solve the 'valley' problem in the topside ionosphere of Mars. The electron density profiles with 'valleys' observed by the Radio Occultation experiment onboard MGS are used to rebuild the virtual depths at MARSIS frequencies. The reconstructed electron density profile by the least square method with a simple model from the rebuilt virtual depth curve is compared with the original electron density profile. It is proved that this method can reproduce small valleys in the profile of the Martian ionosphere well.",

         "abstract": "Bimolecular diffusion coefficients are important parameters used by atmospheric models to calculate altitude profiles of minor constituents in an atmosphere. Unfortunately, laboratory measurements of these coefficients were never conducted at temperature conditions relevant to the atmosphere of Titan. Here we conduct a detailed uncertainty analysis of the bimolecular diffusion coefficient parameters as applied to Titan's upper atmosphere to provide a better understanding of the impact of uncertainty for this parameter on models. Because temperature and pressure conditions are much lower than the laboratory conditions in which bimolecular diffusion parameters were measured, we apply a Bayesian framework, a problem-agnostic framework, to determine parameter estimates and associated uncertainties. We solve the Bayesian calibration problem using the open-source QUESO library which also performs a propagation of uncertainties in the calibrated parameters to temperature and pressure conditions observed in Titan's upper atmosphere. Our results show that, after propagating uncertainty through the Massman model, the uncertainty in molecular diffusion is highly correlated to temperature and we observe no noticeable correlation with pressure. We propagate the calibrated molecular diffusion estimate and associated uncertainty to obtain an estimate with uncertainty due to bimolecular diffusion for the methane molar fraction as a function of altitude. Results show that the uncertainty in methane abundance due to molecular diffusion is in general small compared to eddy diffusion and the chemical kinetics description. However, methane abundance is most sensitive to uncertainty in molecular diffusion above 1200 km where the errors are nontrivial and could have important implications for scientific research based on diffusion models in this altitude range.",

We propose that the observations are consistent with a slow-mode shock transition. In the terrestrial magnetosheath, a number of observations have been made that are consistent with slow-mode waves or shocks. In addition, a number of observations have established that, at least occasionally, slow-mode structures form at the plasma sheet-lobe boundary in the terrestrial magnetotail, related to X lines associated with reconnection. There has been only one previously reported observation of a slow-mode shock-like transition in the Jovian plasma environment. This observation was made in the dayside magnetosheath. The observation we report here was made well downstream of the magnetosphere in Jupiter's magnetosheath, at local time \u223c19:10. For our analysis we have used the data from the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) and the Magnetometer (MAG).

         "abstract": "Based on multi-satellite and ground observations, we investigated an influence of long-lasting and gradual enhancements of magnetic flux transport rate on the magnetotail fast flow duration. On March 10th, 2009, THEMIS-B, which was located in the central plasma sheet of middle distant magnetotail (X<SUB>GSM</SUB> ~-25.8 R<SUB>E</SUB>), observed the fast flows with the velocity exceeding 300 km/s, lasting over 3 h for intense southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) period. During long-lasting fast flows, AL index variations were very extensive and their recovery was much slow. Pi 2 waves were observed at the ground observatories around the THEMIS's footpoints and at low-/mid-latitudes. The aspect for these AL variations suggests Steady Magnetospheric Convection (SMC), but clear substorm signatures were also observed. Further magnetic dipolarization was detected by THEMIS-A at X<SUB>GSM</SUB> ~-8.2 R<SUB>E</SUB> and its nearby THEMIS-E. Only THEMIS-A observed the associated energetic electron flux enhancements. Therefore, the fast flows occurred during substorm with energetic particle injections at \u201cimitative\u201d SMC, which would be driven by prolonged intense southward IMF. The cumulative transport rates of magnetic and Poynting fluxes consecutively and gradually enhanced. On the other hand, THEMIS-C detected much shorter fast flows with the duration of 37 min at X<SUB>GSM</SUB> ~-18.1 R<SUB>E</SUB> and weak/gradual substorm-associated dipolarization. However, the cumulative magnetic flux transport rate was enhanced only during the fast flow interval and was saturated after the fast flows. From different magnetic transport rate profiles at THEMIS-B and THEMIS-C, the realms of dipolar-configured field lines expanded to near THEMIS-C's position responsible for long-lasting fast flow-associated consecutive and gradual magnetic flux pileup. Because the resultant \u201chigh-speed flow braking\u201d region was retreated into a few R<SUB>E</SUB> tailward direction, long-lasting fast flows were almost stemmed. These results suggest that the cumulative magnetic flux transport rate is one of the important factors to determine \u201cfate\u201d (duration) of the magnetotail fast flows.",

Here we analyzed the daily sunspot-group data reported by the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during the period 1874-1976, Debrecen Photoheligraphic Data (DPD) during the period 1977-2017, and the revised Version-2 of international sunspot number (ISSN) during the period 1874-2017. We determined the amplitudes (the largest 13-month smoothed monthly ISSN) of Solar Cycles 12-24 and the 13-month smoothed monthly mean corrected areas of the sunspot groups in the Sun's whole-sphere (WSGA), northern hemisphere (NSGA), and southern hemisphere (SSGA) at the epochs of the maxima of Solar Cycles 12-24. Using all these we obtained the relations similar to that found in our earlier analyzes-i.e. the existence of a high correlation between the sum of the areas of sunspot groups in the southern-hemisphere near-equatorial band during a small (7-9 months) interval just after a maximum epoch of a solar cycle and the amplitude of next solar cycle-separately for the Sun's whole-sphere and northern- and southern-hemispheres. By using these relations we predict \u2248701 msh (millionth of solar hemisphere), \u2248429 msh, and \u2248366 msh for the values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA, respectively, at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25. We predict 86 \u00b118 for the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25. The 13-month smoothed monthly mean sunspot-group area highly correlate with that of ISSN. Using this relation and the predicted values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA we obtain 68 \u00b111 for the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25, which is slightly lower than the aforementioned predicted value, and 39 \u00b14 and 31 \u00b16 for the values of northern- and southern-hemispheres' sunspot numbers at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25. The difference between the predicted NSGA and SSGA and also that between northern- and southern-hemispheres' sunspot numbers at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25 are considerably small. Overall, our results suggest that the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25 would be 25%-40% smaller, and the corresponding north-south asymmetry would be much smaller, than those of Solar Cycle 24.",

         "abstract": "The importance of the periodicity in sunspot appearance was well recognized by the mid-19th century. Several observatories around the globe have made the record of sunspots in the form of drawings and preserved them safely for posterity. At the Kodaikanal Observatory (KO), the sunspot observations have begun in 1905. In those times observations were recorded on photographic plates and after the development of those plates in the laboratory, the drawings of the same were made on the Stonyhurst grids. In these drawings, called sun charts, different features on the sun's disk, e.g., sunspots, plages, filaments, prominences, etc. were clearly identified and visually marked with different colors. We have collected 111 years of sunspot drawing spanning over 10 solar cycles. These sunspot drawings were carefully stitched to make bound volumes, each for every 6-months. The drawings are kept at the Kodaikanal library for scientific use and analysis. In this article, we describe briefly the process of drawing, methods of counting sunspot numbers and measurement of sunspot area using square grids. We have collected the data for the northern and southern hemispheres separately. From the collected data, we compute the sunspot number and area and compare it with Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) and Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) data. The results show that the measurement of the sunspot number is underestimated by about 40%. The KO monthly averaged sunspot number data of both hemispheres is normalized with the RGO monthly averaged total sunspot number data. This procedure provided a good correlated data set that can be used for further scientific work in the future. The sunspot area data from KO is slightly underestimated in the first 5-cycles and seems mildly overestimated in the later 5-cycles. These data sets are valuable additions to the existing data of sunspot records.",

         "abstract": "According to Gnevyshev-Ohl (G-O) rule an odd-numbered cycle is stronger than its preceding even-numbered cycle. In the modern time the cycle pair (22, 23) violated this rule. By using the combined Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) and Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) sunspot group data during the period 1874-2015, and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) of sunspot groups during the period 1974-2015, here we have found that the solar cycle pair (22, 23) violated the G-O rule because, besides during cycle 23 a large deficiency of small sunspot groups in both the northern and the southern hemispheres, during cycle 22 a large abundance of small sunspot groups in the southern hemisphere. In the case of large and small sunspot groups the cycle pair (22, 23) violated the G-O rule in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, suggesting the north-south asymmetry in solar activity has a significant contribution in the violation of G-O rule. The amplitude of solar cycle 24 is smaller than that of solar cycle 23. However, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) rate in the rising phases of the cycles 23 and 24 are almost same (even slightly large in cycle 24). From both the SOON and the DPD sunspot group data here we have also found that on the average the ratio of the number (counts) of large sunspot groups to the number of small sunspot groups is larger in the rising phase of cycle 24 than that in the corresponding phase of cycle 23. We suggest this could be a potential reason for the aforesaid discrepancy in the CME rates during the rising phases of cycles 23 and 24. These results have significant implication on solar cycle mechanism.",

         "abstract": "A number of fundamental questions as regards the physical nature of sunspots are formulated. In order to answer these questions, we apply the model of a round-shaped unipolar sunspot with a lower boundary consisting of cool plasma and with strong magnetic field at the depth of about 4 Mm beneath the photosphere, in accordance with the data of local helioseismology and with certain physically sound arguments (the shallow sunspot model). The magnetic configuration of a sunspot is assumed to be close to the observed one and similar to the magnetic field of a round solenoid of the appropriate size. The transverse (horizontal) and longitudinal (vertical) equilibria of a sunspot were calculated based on the thermodynamic approach and taking into account the magnetic, gravitational, and thermal energy of the spot and the pressure of the environment. The dependence of the magnetic field strength in the sunspot center, B <SUB>0</SUB>, on the radius of the sunspot umbra a is derived theoretically for the first time in the history of sunspot studies. It shows that the magnetic field strength in small spots is about 700 Gauss (G) and then increases monotonically with a, tending asymptotically to a limit value of about 4000 G. This dependence, B <SUB>0</SUB>( a) includes, as parameters, the gravity acceleration on the solar surface, the density of gas in the photosphere, and the ratio of the radius of the spot (including penumbra), a <SUB>p</SUB>, to the radius of its umbra a. It is shown that large-scale subsurface flows of gas in the sunspot vicinity, being the consequence but not the cause of sunspot formation, are too weak to contribute significantly to the pressure balance of the sunspot. Stability of the sunspot is provided by cooling of the sunspot plasma and decreasing of its gravitational energy due to the vertical redistribution of the gas density when the geometric Wilson depression of the sunspot is formed. The depth of a depression grows linearly with B <SUB>0</SUB>, in contrast to the quadratic law for the magnetic energy. Therefore, the range of stable equilibria turns out to be limited: large spots, with radius a larger than some limit value (about 12-18 Mm, depending on the magnetic field configuration), are unstable. It explains the absence of very large spots on the Sun and the appearance of light bridges in big spots that divide the spot into a few parts. The sunspots with B <SUB>0</SUB>\u22482.6\u00f72.7 kilogauss (kG) and a\u22485 Mm are most stable. For these spots, taken as a single magnetic structure, the period of their vertical eigen oscillations is minimal and amounts, according to the model, to 10-12 hours. It corresponds well to the period derived from the study of long-term oscillations of sunspots using SOHO/MDI data.",

It is found that the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very noticeable time lag of 13, 8, and 8 months in cycle 21 respectively with respect to the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers. There is no time lag between the sunspot numbers and M-class flares in cycle 22. However, there is a one-month time lag for C-class flares and a one-month time lead for X-class flares with regard to sunspot numbers in cycle 22. For cycle 23, the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very noticeable time lag of one month, 5 months, and 21 months respectively with respect to sunspot numbers. If we take the three types of flares together, the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of soft X-ray flares have a time lag of 9 months in cycle 21, no time lag in cycle 22 and a characteristic time lag of 5 months in cycle 23 with respect to the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients of the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of M-class and X-class flares and the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers are higher in cycle 22 than those in cycles 21 and 23. The correlation coefficients between the three kinds of soft X-ray flares in cycle 22 are higher than those in cycles 21 and 23. These findings may be instructive in predicting C-class, M-class, and X-class flares regarding sunspot numbers in the next cycle and the physical processes of energy storage and dissipation in the corona.",

The \u223c6 month smoothed variation (FFT filter technique) of the total sunspot areas shows double peaks (solar maximum) with the ascending phase in each cycle for the periods 1989, 1991, 2000, 2002, 2011, and 2014. We have observed mid-term periodicity (intermediate-term) such as the Rieger-type period (\u223c120 to \u223c190 days), quasi-period (\u223c200 to \u223c380 days), and quasi-biennial period (\u223c1.20 to \u223c3.83 years) of the sunspot areas (total sunspot area, and northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun) for the combined solar cycles 22 to 24; using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Morlet wavelet transformation (WT) techniques (wavelet power spectra and contour plot). The period \u223c1.33 year of the southern hemisphere and total sunspot areas have shown the rotation rates on the basis of the convection zone. The quasi-annual period \u223c356 days is observed as an important period for the total sunspot area and the southern hemisphere and are absent in the northern hemisphere of the Sun. The periodicities of the total sunspot areas, and southern and northern hemisphere constitute the fifth, sixth and seventh subharmonic of the solar synodic rotation of \u223c27 days in the range of the Rieger-type periodicity. The 24th subharmonic of the solar synodic rotation of \u223c27 days is highly significant in the total sunspot area and the southern hemisphere of the Sun during the period of our study (1986-2016).",

A number of radial field distributions, such as the Broxon's formula, is discussed in the literature, but the generally accepted, \"canonical\" profile of the vertical field in a sunspot does not exist on today. Magnetograms obtained with the HMI device of the Solar Dynamic Observatory (Scherrer et al. in Sol. Phys. 275(1-2):207-227, 2012), due to their high spatial resolution, provide a good opportunity to get closer to solving this problem. We have studied 30 regular round-shaped unipolar sunspots, situated near the center of the solar disk, without any changes of their configuration or the magnetic field strength during a day or two. Four radial cuts were taken on the magnetograms for each of these 30 sunspots. The magnetic field strength measured along a cut was normalized to the maximum value of the field in the sunspot, all distances are measured in units of the radius of the umbra of the sunspot. It is shown that the radial profile of the vertical field averaged over all studied sunspots has a smooth bell-shaped form and can be well described by the analytic formula for a magnetic monopole, with the depth of immersion into the convective zone of the Sun close to the radius of the sunspot umbra.",

Every sunspot group is formed and shaped by the magnetic field of the Sun. Hence, the magnetic field intensity shows itself as the size of a sunspot group area on the surface. This shows that getting the development or evolution of sunspot groups over time means getting the change of magnetic field intensity during same interval. Here, to reveal the evolution of sunspot groups in a cycle, a method called Solar Cycle Analyzer Tool (SCAT) is presented. This method was developed as a part of Computer-Aided Measurements for Sunspots (CAMS) because the same subroutines and subprograms were used for calculations (\u00c7akmak in Exp. Astron. 38:77-89, 2014). The developed software tracks sunspot groups every day and gives them the same group number. The confirmation is made by the user to prevent counting re-formations as a continuation of an old group in the same active region. With this method, the evolution of every sunspot group can be listed for each cycle year besides other cycle features like the daily and monthly sunspot relative numbers and distribution frequency of the sunspot group types. Since 2015, SCAT is being used to get data for the annual reports of Istanbul University Observatory.",

The data series with standard deviation of 0.35 arcsec shows the long-term variational trend with 0.04 arcsec/year. On the other hand, the data series of solar radius are compared with the data of sunspot activity and H- \u03b1 flare index for the same period. Over the seven year trend, we have found significant linear anti-correlations between the solar radius and other indicators such as sunspot numbers, sunspot areas, and H- \u03b1 flare index. While the solar radius displays the strongest anti-correlation (-0.7676) with sunspot numbers, it shows a significant anti-correlation of -0.6365 with sunspot areas. But, the anti-correlation between the solar radius and H- \u03b1 flare index is found to be -0.4975, slightly lower than others. In addition, we computed Hurst exponent of the data sets ranging between 0.7214 and 0.7996, exhibiting the persistent behavior for the long term trend. In the light of the strong correlations with high significance, we may suggest that there are a causal relationship between the solar radius and solar time series such as sunspot activity and H- \u03b1 flare index.",

         "abstract": "The ability to model the ionosphere accurately for single frequency users in satellite applications has gained some appreciable usage, most especially during quiet conditions in a mild (middle latitudes) ionosphere. However, solving the problem of ionosphere for single frequency user of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) region is of a great concern for space scientists and engineers. Several methodologies have been used to develop models that describe global or regional maps for ionosphere errors in order to mitigate the effect of the errors on GNSS systems. Global or regional ionosphere Maps have been known to be an efficient tool to monitor the delay introduced by the ionosphere in the satellite signals. This research uses the conventional Planar fit and ordinary Kriging methodologies to assess a regional map for ionosphere correction in equatorial African sector. The result obtained is an indication that modified Kriging methodology describes the EIA ionosphere corrections better compared with ordinary Kriging and Planar fit methodologies.",

         "abstract": "Electron acceleration in the near-Earth magnetotail during the substorm period is still an unresolved question. In this paper, by tracing electron trajectories in the dynamically evolving electromagnetic fields obtained from a two-dimensional (2D) global hybrid simulation, we investigate electron acceleration in the near-Earth magnetotail during dipolarization. In our simulation, electrons with energies above several keV can gain energy in the plasma sheet due to the adiabatic acceleration mechanism when these electrons propagate earthward. In the near-Earth magnetotail (about 9-15 R<SUB>E</SUB> from the Earth), these electrons can be accelerated by betatron acceleration which is due to the compression of magnetic field associated with dipolarization of magnetotail. Additionally, in the middle and high latitudes of the near-Earth magnetotail, the parallel electric field carrying by kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves can also accelerate electrons when these electrons bounce between the mirror points. The combination effects of these three acceleration mechanisms can accelerate electrons from several keV to about one hundred keV. Our results indicate that both the large-scale structure and wave-particle interactions need to be taken into account for electron acceleration in the near-Earth magnetotail.",

         "abstract": "Energy transport during a geomagnetic substorm is a very important process for solar wind-magnetosphere energy coupling and the energy cycle in the magnetotail. In this paper, we use magnetotail data from the five THEMIS probes and two Cluster satellites on the dayside to investigate the energy transport of one intense storm during the period from 08 March to 11 March 2008 at large spatial-temporal scales. Simultaneous observations of the five THEMIS probes indicate that there is a stronger and earlier duskward energy flux density in the near-Earth magnetotail than that in the mid-tail in the initial phase. Low energy particles inject earthward from the dusk flank. Stronger and more variable earthward energy flux density is observed in the mid-tail compared to that near Earth in the main phase; mainly caused by high-speed flow. Tailward energy flux was observed in the near-Earth and mid-tail regions during the recovery phase. Dayside data observed by two Cluster satellites show that the duskward energy flux may be related to stable solar wind input. Tailward energy flux on the dayside should experience some energy conversion process in the magnetotail before it can provide the earthward energy flux in the magnetotail for this intense storm. The strongest energy transport observed by the nightside probes occurs in the main phase. However, the strongest energy measured by the dayside satellites is in the recovery phase without intense activities, two hours later. Different features of the energy transport in the three phases of the storm may be closely related to the different physical processes such as the energy entry, westward drift, particle injection or other potential mechanisms.",

         "abstract": "Measurements of multi satellites and geomagnetic indices are used to investigate the energy budget during an isolated substorm. The calculation of the energy transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere (parameter \u025b), the energy increase of the ring current (U_{{R}}), the Joule heating (U_{{J}}), the particle precipitation energy flux (U_{{A}}) and their time-integrated energy dissipation {W}_{\u025b}, {W}_{{R}}, {W}_{{J}}, {W}_{{A}} indicates that there should be energy dissipation such as plasma heating and the energy returned to the solar wind by plasmoid ejection from the tail. After calculating the spatial sizes of nine selected BBFs, the energy flux density and energy transported Earthward or tailward by BBFs, using observations from three satellites, are found to be different during an isolated substorm. The flow thermal energy is dominant whether the energy is transported Earthward or tailward under the frozen-in condition in the inner plasma sheet. From results simultaneously observed by three satellites in the magnetotail, we find that the Earthward energy transported by the flows can provide the energy dissipation of {W}_{{J}} and {W}_{{A}}, where the flows are Earthward for more than 60% of the samples, while the tailward energy transport is far larger than {U}_{{A}} and close to {U}_{{J}}, where the flows are tailward for less than 40% of the samples. The maximum energy flux density is observed by one satellite to be accompanied by large variations, while the maximum energy transport is observed by another satellite with large energy flux density and small variations. This suggests misleading conclusions would be obtained if there were only data from single (or two) satellites. From our results, BBFs play an important role in the process of energy transport both Earthward and tailward during this isolated substorm. Data based on observations from one satellite in the magnetotail could be easily misinterpreted and should be used cautiously.",

IRIS was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit on 27 June 2013 using a Pegasus-XL rocket and consists of a 19-cm UV telescope that feeds a slit-based dual-bandpass imaging spectrograph. IRIS obtains spectra in passbands from 1332 - 1358 \u00c5, 1389 - 1407 \u00c5, and 2783 - 2834 \u00c5, including bright spectral lines formed in the chromosphere (Mg ii h 2803 \u00c5 and Mg ii k 2796 \u00c5) and transition region (C ii 1334/1335 \u00c5 and Si iv 1394/1403 \u00c5). Slit-jaw images in four different passbands (C ii 1330, Si iv 1400, Mg ii k 2796, and Mg ii wing 2830 \u00c5) can be taken simultaneously with spectral rasters that sample regions up to 130 arcsec \u00d7 175 arcsec at a variety of spatial samplings (from 0.33 arcsec and up). IRIS is sensitive to emission from plasma at temperatures between 5000 K and 10 MK and will advance our understanding of the flow of mass and energy through an interface region, formed by the chromosphere and transition region, between the photosphere and corona. This highly structured and dynamic region not only acts as the conduit of all mass and energy feeding into the corona and solar wind, it also requires an order of magnitude more energy to heat than the corona and solar wind combined. The IRIS investigation includes a strong numerical modeling component based on advanced radiative-MHD codes to facilitate interpretation of observations of this complex region. Approximately eight Gbytes of data (after compression) are acquired by IRIS each day and made available for unrestricted use within a few days of the observation.",

         "abstract": "Images of the extended solar corona, as observed by different white-light coronagraphs, include the K- and F-corona and suffer from a radial variation in intensity. These images require separation of the two coronal components with some additional image-processing to reduce the intensity gradient and analyse the structures and processes occurring at different heights in the solar corona within the full field of view. Over the past few decades, coronagraphs have been producing enormous amounts of data, which will be continued with the launch of new telescopes. To process these bulk coronagraph images with steep radial-intensity gradients, we have developed the algorithm Simple Radial Gradient Filter (SiRGraF). This algorithm is based on subtracting a minimum background (F-corona) created using long-duration images and then dividing the resultant by a uniform-intensity-gradient image to enhance the K-corona. We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm to bring out the short-time-scale transient structures of the corona. SiRGraF can be used to reveal and analyse such structures. It is not suitable for quantitative estimations based on intensity. We have successfully tested the algorithm on images of the Large Angle Spectroscopic COronagraph (LASCO)-C2 onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and COR-2A onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along with low-SNR images of STEREO/COR-1A and the KCoronagraph (KCor). We also compared the performance of SiRGraF with the existing widely used algorithm Normalizing Radial Gradient Filter (NRGF). We found that when hundreds of images have to be processed, SiRGraF works faster than NRGF, providing similar brightness and contrast in the images and separating the transient features. Moreover, SiRGraF works better on low-SNR images of COR-1A than on NRGF, providing better identification of dynamic coronal structures throughout the field of view. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the algorithm. The application of SiRGraF to COR-1 images can be extended for an automated coronal mass ejection (CME) detection algorithm in the future, which will help in our study of the characteristics of CMEs in the inner corona.",

         "abstract": "Solar activity is asymmetric in the two hemispheres in almost all cycles. This asymmetry is observed both in cycle amplitude and period. We have used about 90 years of sunspot-area data from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory to study the north-south asymmetry in sunspot activity. The monthly mean sunspot-area showed the northern hemisphere dominated in Solar Cycles 16, 19, and 20, and the southern hemisphere dominated in Solar Cycles 18, 22, and 23. The 13-month smoothed data indicated that in Solar Cycle 17 and 21, the northern and southern hemisphere showed equal amplitude. Cumulative sunspot area showed that the northern hemisphere dominated in Solar Cycles 18, 19, 20, and 21, with a large difference between the two hemispheres in Solar Cycles 19 and 20. The northern hemisphere activity led by 12, 15, and 2 months in Solar Cycles 20, 21, and 22, respectively. No significant phase difference is found between the two hemispheres in Solar Cycles 16, 17, 18, 19, and 23. The wavelet technique is used to find Rieger-type periodicities in the sunspot cycles. The cross-wavelet analysis of these data sets showed several statistically significant common periodicities like the Rieger-type periodicities and quasi-biennial oscillations. The Gnevyshev gap was found in both the hemispheric data in Solar Cycles 16, 18, 21, 22, and 23. These results are consistent with the earlier reported characteristics of north-south asymmetry in sunspot-area data. These results suggest that the Kodaikanal Observatory data complement the existing sunspot data from other observatories to study solar activity over long and short periods.",

From the dawn of modern observational astronomy, sunspots have presented a challenge to understanding\u2014their quasi-periodic variation in number, first noted 175 years ago, has stimulated community-wide interest to this day. A large number of techniques are able to explain the temporal landmarks, (geometric) shape, and amplitude of sunspot \"cycles,\" however, forecasting these features accurately in advance remains elusive. Recent observationally-motivated studies have illustrated a relationship between the Sun's 22-year (Hale) magnetic cycle and the production of the sunspot cycle landmarks and patterns, but not the amplitude of the sunspot cycle. Using (discrete) Hilbert transforms on more than 270 years of (monthly) sunspot numbers we robustly identify the so-called \"termination\" events that mark the end of the previous 11-yr sunspot cycle, the enhancement/acceleration of the present cycle, and the end of 22-yr magnetic activity cycles. Using these we extract a relationship between the temporal spacing of terminators and the magnitude of sunspot cycles. Given this relationship and our prediction of a terminator event in 2020, we deduce that sunspot Solar Cycle 25 could have a magnitude that rivals the top few since records began. This outcome would be in stark contrast to the community consensus estimate of sunspot Solar Cycle 25 magnitude.",

         "abstract": "Historical sunspot records and the construction of a comprehensive database are among the most sought after research activities in solar physics. Here, we revisit the issues and remaining questions on the reconstruction of the so-called group sunspot numbers (GSN) that was pioneered by D. Hoyt and colleagues. We use the modern tools of artificial intelligence (AI) by applying various algorithms based on machine learning (ML) to GSN records. The goal is to offer a new vision in the reconstruction of sunspot activity variations, i.e. a Bayesian reconstruction, in order to obtain a complete probabilistic GSN record from 1610 to 2020. This new GSN reconstruction is consistent with the historical GSN records. In addition, we perform a comparison between our new probabilistic GSN record and the most recent GSN reconstructions produced by several solar researchers under various assumptions and constraints. Our AI algorithms are able to reveal various new underlying patterns and channels of variations that can fully account for the complete GSN time variability, including intervals with extremely low or weak sunspot activity like the Maunder Minimum from 1645 - 1715. Our results show that the GSN records are not strictly represented by the 11-year cycles alone, but that other important timescales for a fuller reconstruction of GSN activity history are the 5.5-year, 22-year, 30-year, 60-year, and 120-year oscillations. The comprehensive GSN reconstruction by AI/ML is able to shed new insights on the nature and characteristics of not only the underlying 11-year-like sunspot cycles but also on the 22-year Hale's polarity cycles during the Maunder Minimum, among other results previously hidden so far. In the early 1850s, Wolf multiplied his original sunspot number reconstruction by a factor of 1.25 to arrive at the canonical Wolf sunspot numbers (WSN). Removing this multiplicative factor, we find that the GSN and WSN differ by only a few percent for the period 1700 to 1879. In a comparison to the international sunspot number (ISN) recently recommended by Clette et al. (Space Sci. Rev. 186, 35, 2014), several differences are found and discussed. More sunspot observations are still required. Our article points to observers that are not yet included in the GSN database.",

         "abstract": "In most of the solar cycles, activity in the northern and southern hemispheres peaks at different times. One hemisphere peaks well before the other, and at least one of the hemispheric maxima frequently does not coincide with the whole sphere maximum. Prediction of the maximum of a hemisphere and the corresponding north-south asymmetry of a solar cycle may help to understand the mechanisms of the solar cycle, the solar-terrestrial relationship, and solar-activity influences on space weather. Here we analysed the sunspot-group data from the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during 1874 - 1976 and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during 1977 - 2017 and studied the cycle-to-cycle variations in the values of 13-month smoothed monthly mean sunspot-group area in the whole sphere (WSGA), northern hemisphere (NSGA), and southern hemisphere (SSGA) at the epochs of maxima of Sunspot Cycles 12 - 24 and at the epochs of maxima of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA Cycles 12 - 24 (note that solar-cycle variation of a parameter is expressed as a cycle of that parameter). The cosine fits to the values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA at the maxima of sunspot, WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA Cycles 12 - 24, and to the values of the corresponding north-south asymmetry, suggest the existence of a \u2248132-year periodicity in the activity of the northern hemisphere, a 54 - 66-year periodicity in the activity of the southern hemisphere, and a 50 - 66 year periodicity in the north-south asymmetry in activity at all the aforementioned epochs. By extrapolating the best-fit cosine curves we predicted the amplitudes and the corresponding north-south asymmetry of the 25th WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA cycles. We find that on average Solar Cycle 25 in sunspot-group area would be to some extent smaller than Solar Cycle 24 in sunspot-group area. However, by inputting the predicted amplitudes of the 25th WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA cycles relationship between sunspot-group area and sunspot number we find that the amplitude (130 \u00b112 ) of Sunspot Cycle 25 would be slightly larger than that of reasonably small Sunspot Cycle 24. Still it confirms that the beginning of the upcoming Gleissberg cycle would take place around Solar Cycle 25. We also find that except at the maximum of NSGA Cycle 25 where the strength of activity in the northern hemisphere would be dominant, the strength of activity in the southern hemisphere would be dominant at the maximum epochs of the 25th sunspot, WSGA, and SSGA cycles.",

         "abstract": "In an effort to understand the three-dimensional structure of the solar corona and inner heliosphere during the Whole Heliosphere Interval (WHI), we have developed a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solution for Carrington rotation (CR) 2068. Our model, which includes energy-transport processes, such as coronal heating, conduction of heat parallel to the magnetic field, radiative losses, and the effects of Alfv\u00e9n waves, is capable of producing significantly better estimates of the plasma temperature and density in the corona than have been possible in the past. With such a model, we can compute emission in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray wavelengths, as well as scattering in polarized white light. Additionally, from our heliospheric solutions, we can deduce magnetic-field and plasma parameters along specific spacecraft trajectories. In this paper, we present a general analysis of the large-scale structure of the solar corona and inner heliosphere during WHI, focusing, in particular, on i) helmet-streamer structure; ii) the location of the heliospheric current sheet; and iii) the geometry of corotating interaction regions. We also compare model results with i) EUV observations from the EIT instrument onboard SOHO; and ii) in-situ measurements made by the STEREO-A and B spacecraft. Finally, we contrast the global structure of the corona and inner heliosphere during WHI with its structure during the Whole Sun Month (WSM) interval. Overall, our model reproduces the essential features of the observations; however, many discrepancies are present. We discuss several likely causes for them and suggest how model predictions may be improved in the future.",

         "abstract": "To better study the importance of the collision of different magnetic systems in generating magnetically complex sunspot groups and major (M- and X-class) flares, we define the index ALW: A r e a /LW, where LW represents the latitudinal width of the sunspot group band, and A r e a represents the total area of sunspot groups within the latitudinal width. Then, using the sunspot-group data collected by the United States Air Force/Mount Wilson Observatory and the flare data recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, we investigate the variations of the ALW-index, the percentage of complex sunspot groups, and the percentage of major flares in the northern and southern hemispheres during Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24. The main findings are reported as follows: First, in most cases, the maximum percentage of complex sunspot groups occurs after the maximum ALW is reached, and ALW starts to decrease. The result suggests that the collision of different magnetic systems cannot affect directly whether more complex sunspot groups are produced or more complex sunspot groups may be produced when there is a lower probability of the collision of different magnetic-flux systems, which does not support the suggestion of Jaeggli and Norton (Astrophys. J. Lett.820, L11, 2016). Second, in most cases, the maximum percentage of complex sunspot groups occurs after the maximum percentage of major flares is reached, and the percentage of major flares starts to decrease, supporting the suggestion of Nikbakhsh et al. (Astron. Astrophys.629, A45, 2019) - the large-scale dynamo peaks before the small-scale dynamo starts increasing, and the complex sunspot groups are linked to the small-scale dynamo taking over after the large-scale dynamo starts decreasing.",

Following a modified approach similar to that presented in Pevtsov et al. ( Astrophys. J. Lett. 742, L36, 2011), we selected the sunspot with the strongest measured field strength for each observing week and computed monthly averages of these weekly maximum field strengths. The data show the solar cycle variation of the peak field strengths with an amplitude of about 500 - 700 gauss (G), but no statistically significant long-term trends. Next, we used the sunspot observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) to establish a relationship between the sunspot areas and the sunspot field strengths for cycles 15 - 19. This relationship was used to create a proxy of the peak magnetic field strength based on sunspot areas from the RGO and the USAF/NOAA network for the period from 1874 to early 2012. Over this interval, the magnetic field proxy shows a clear solar cycle variation with an amplitude of 500 - 700 G and a weaker long-term trend. From 1874 to around 1920, the mean value of magnetic field proxy increases by about 300 - 350 G, and, following a broad maximum in 1920 - 1960, it decreases by about 300 G. Using the proxy for the magnetic field strength as the reference, we scaled the MWO field measurements to the measurements of the magnetic fields in Pevtsov et al. (2011) to construct a combined data set of maximum sunspot field strengths extending from 1920 to early 2012. This combined data set shows strong solar cycle variations and no significant long-term trend (the linear fit to the data yields a slope of - 0.2\u00b10.8 G year<SUP>-1</SUP>). On the other hand, the peak sunspot field strengths observed at the minimum of the solar cycle show a gradual decline over the last three minima (corresponding to cycles 21 - 23) with a mean downward trend of \u2248 15 G year<SUP>-1</SUP>.",

         "abstract": "We investigate the solar flare occurrence rate and daily flare probability in terms of the sunspot classification supplemented with sunspot area and its changes. For this we use the NOAA active region data and GOES solar flare data for 15 years (from January 1996 to December 2010). We consider the most flare-productive 11 sunspot classes in the McIntosh sunspot group classification. Sunspot area and its changes can be a proxy of magnetic flux and its emergence/cancellation, respectively. We classify each sunspot group into two sub-groups by its area: \"Large\" and \"Small\". In addition, for each group, we classify it into three sub-groups according to sunspot area changes: \"Decrease\", \"Steady\", and \"Increase\". As a result, in the case of compact groups, their flare occurrence rates and daily flare probabilities noticeably increase with sunspot group area. We also find that the flare occurrence rates and daily flare probabilities for the \"Increase\" sub-groups are noticeably higher than those for the other sub-groups. In case of the (M+X)-class flares in the `Dkc' group, the flare occurrence rate of the \"Increase\" sub-group is three times higher than that of the \"Steady\" sub-group. The mean flare occurrence rates and flare probabilities for all sunspot groups increase with the following order: \"Decrease\", \"Steady\", and \"Increase\". Our results statistically demonstrate that magnetic flux and its emergence enhance the occurrence of major solar flares.",

         "abstract": "The last solar minimum was, by recent standards, unusually deep and long. We are now close to the maximum of the subsequent solar cycle, which is relatively weak. In this article we make comparisons between different global (unresolved) measures of the Sun's magnetic activity to investigate how they are responding to this weak-activity epoch. We focus on helioseismic data, which are sensitive to conditions, including the characteristics of the magnetic field, in the solar interior. Also considered are measures of the magnetic field in the photosphere (sunspot number and sunspot area), the chromosphere and corona (10.7 cm radio flux and 530.3 nm green coronal index), and two measures of the Sun's magnetic activity closer to Earth (the interplanetary magnetic field and the galactic cosmic-ray intensity). Scaled versions of the activity proxies diverge from the helioseismic data around 2000, indicating a change in relationship between the proxies. The degree of divergence varies from proxy to proxy, with sunspot area and 10.7 cm flux showing only small deviations, while sunspot number, coronal index, and the two interplanetary proxies show much larger departures. In Cycle 24 the deviations in the solar proxies and the helioseismic data decrease, raising the possibility that the deviations observed in Cycle 23 are just symptomatic of a 22-year Hale cycle. However, the deviations in the helioseismic data and the interplanetary proxies increase in Cycle 24. Interestingly, the divergence in the solar proxies and the helioseismic data are not reflected in the shorter-term variations (often referred to as quasi-biennial oscillations) observed on top of the dominant 11-year solar cycle. However, despite being highly correlated in Cycle 22, the short-term variations in the interplanetary proxies show very little correlation with the helioseismic data during Cycles 23 and 24.",

         "abstract": "Sunspots have been observed to undergo rotation about their umbral centre. This is typically a slow rotation, with even the fastest sunspot rotations only reaching angular velocities of a few degrees per hour. This rotation may inject magnetic energy into the Sun's atmosphere, which can be stored in the coronal magnetic field and later released in eruptive events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. To usefully investigate rotating sunspots long periods of data need to be analysed, often of the order of several days, to build up a bulk rotation profile for the sunspot over time. This article outlines a semi-automated approach for analysing series of solar continuum data to extract the rotation profile of a sunspot as it transits across the solar disc. Moving towards an automated approach is vital for generating large, unbiased statistical samples of rotating sunspots in order to understand their contribution to solar activity. Existing methods typically focus on sunspots near disc centre for short time periods, neglecting much of the rotation history of the sunspot. The method is tested on six sunspots observed in continuum data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). These have been chosen to test the method for a range of different types of sunspots, including well-behaved sunspots, shape-changing sunspots, fast rotators, non-rotators, and interacting sunspots. The rotation profiles are compared by eye to animations of the sunspot from the data and are in acceptable visual agreement with the observed bulk rotation of the sunspot for all of the cases, except for the one which contains two sunspots in a shared penumbra. The method is also tested against sunspot rotations in active region (AR) 11158 that have been reported in the literature. While the results compare to some degree, the method outlined in this article reports lower rotations than those reported in the literature. Some of this discrepancy can be attributed to selection bias by the approaches in the literature, where only features that undergo larger rotation are tracked in sunspots that exhibit non-uniform rotation. The method also provides uncertainties on the calculated rotation profile which can be broken down to allow the principal sources of error to be identified. For the test sunspots in this article, the dominant source of uncertainty is the resolution of the SDO/HMI instrument.",

         "abstract": "Long-lived (&gt;20 days) sunspot groups extracted from the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) are examined for evidence of decadal change. The problem of identifying sunspot groups that are observed on consecutive solar rotations (recurrent sunspot groups) is tackled by first constructing manually an example dataset of recurrent sunspot groups and then using machine learning to generalise this subset to the whole GPR. The resulting dataset of recurrent sunspot groups is verified against previous work by A. Maunder and other Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) compilers. Recurrent groups are found to exhibit a slightly larger value for the Gnevyshev - Waldmeier Relationship than the value found by Petrovay and van Driel-Gesztelyi ( Solar Phys. 51, 25, 1977), who used recurrence data from the Debrecen Photoheliographic Results. Evidence for sunspot-group lifetime change over the previous century is observed within recurrent groups. A lifetime increase of a factor of 1.4 between 1915 and 1940 is found, which closely agrees with results from Blanter et al. ( Solar Phys. 237, 329, 2006). Furthermore, this increase is found to exist over a longer period (1915 to 1950) than previously thought and provisional evidence is found for a decline between 1950 and 1965. Possible applications of machine-learning procedures to the analysis of historical sunspot observations, the determination of the magnetic topology of the solar corona and the incidence of severe space-weather events are outlined briefly.",

         "abstract": "Forecasting of solar activity is extremely important, due to its impact on our space-based technology. In recent years, we have observed a continuous decline in the peak sunspot number for Solar Cycles (SCs) 21 to 24. We are more curious about peak activity of SC 25 because if the solar activity weakens further, then it may be an indication of new extended minima. So far, the daily sunspot-number data make up the longest observational series of the solar activity available, and recently this has been replaced with the corrected new Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. In general, different prediction models are available to forecast the peak smoothed sunspot number (SSN) of the upcoming SC but they are based on the older Version 1.0 sunspot data. Therefore, it is necessary to check the applicability of earlier proposed models to predict the peak SSN using the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. Here, we re-evaluate one such earlier proposed prediction model, which is based on the estimates of the Shannon entropy, a measure of randomness, for Version 2.0 sunspot data. We find that this prediction model is applicable to the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. To verify the robustness of the prediction model, we used the histogram and additionally the kernel density estimator (KDE) method to calculate the probability distribution function (PDF). The estimate of the PDF is a prerequisite to compute the Shannon entropy. We found that the prediction model is robust and the correlation coefficients between model parameters are 0.93 and 0.92, respectively, for these two approaches. This exercise provides a new prediction model for the peak SSN based on the Version 2.0 sunspot-number series. The model forecasts the peak smoothed sunspot number of 136.9 \u00b124 using a histogram-derived PDF and 150.7 \u00b125 using a KDE-derived PDF for the upcoming SC 25. These predictions for SC 25 are more reliable as up to date (December 2020) sunspot-number data have been utilized to get the entropy in the end phase of SC 24. It suggests that SC 25 would be similar or slightly stronger than SC 24.",

         "abstract": "One goal of helioseismology is to determine the subsurface structure of sunspots. In order to do so, it is important to understand first the near-surface effects of sunspots on solar waves, which are dominant. Here we construct simplified, cylindrically-symmetric sunspot models that are designed to capture the magnetic and thermodynamics effects coming from about 500 km below the quiet-Sun \u03c4 <SUB>5000</SUB>=1 level to the lower chromosphere. We use a combination of existing semi-empirical models of sunspot thermodynamic structure (density, temperature, pressure): the umbral model of Maltby et al. (1986, Astrophys. J. 306, 284) and the penumbral model of Ding and Fang (1989, Astron. Astrophys. 225, 204). The OPAL equation-of-state tables are used to derive the sound-speed profile. We smoothly merge the near-surface properties to the quiet-Sun values about 1 Mm below the surface. The umbral and penumbral radii are free parameters. The magnetic field is added to the thermodynamic structure, without requiring magnetostatic equilibrium. The vertical component of the magnetic field is assumed to have a Gaussian horizontal profile, with a maximum surface field strength fixed by surface observations. The full magnetic-field vector is solenoidal and determined by the on-axis vertical field, which, at the surface, is chosen such that the field inclination is 45\u00b0 at the umbral - penumbral boundary. We construct a particular sunspot model based on SOHO/MDI observations of the sunspot in active region NOAA 9787. The helioseismic signature of the model sunspot is studied using numerical simulations of the propagation of f, p <SUB>1</SUB>, and p <SUB>2</SUB> wave packets. These simulations are compared against cross-covariances of the observed wave field. We find that the sunspot model gives a helioseismic signature that is similar to the observations.",

         "abstract": "We compare horizontal flow fields in the photosphere and in the subphotosphere (a layer 0.5 Mm below the photosphere) in two solar active regions: AR 11084 and AR 11158. AR 11084 is a mature, simple active region without significant flaring activity, and AR 11158 is a multipolar, complex active region with magnetic flux emerging during the period studied. Flows in the photosphere are derived by applying the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) on HMI-observed vector magnetic fields, and the subphotospheric flows are inferred by time-distance helioseismology using HMI-observed Dopplergrams. Similar flow patterns are found for both layers for AR 11084: inward flows in the sunspot umbra and outward flows surrounding the sunspot. The boundary between the inward and outward flows, which is slightly different in the photosphere and the subphotosphere, is within the sunspot penumbra. The area having inward flows in the subphotosphere is larger than that in the photosphere. For AR 11158, flows in these two layers show great similarities in some areas and significant differences in other areas. Both layers exhibit consistent outward flows in the areas surrounding sunspots. On the other hand, most well-documented flux-emergence-related flow features seen in the photosphere do not have counterparts in the subphotosphere. This implies that the horizontal flows caused by flux emergence do not extend deeply into the subsurface.",

         "abstract": "We find that the element abundances in solar energetic particles (SEPs) and in the slow solar wind (SSW), relative to those in the photosphere, show different patterns as a function of the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements. Generally, the SEP and SSW abundances reflect abundance samples of the solar corona, where low-FIP elements, ionized in the chromosphere, are more efficiently conveyed upward to the corona than high-FIP elements that are initially neutral atoms. Abundances of the elements, especially C, P, and S, show a crossover from low to high FIP at {\u2248} 10 eV in the SEPs but {\u2248} 14 eV for the solar wind. Naively, this seems to suggest cooler plasma from sunspots beneath active regions. More likely, if the ponderomotive force of Alfv\u00e9n waves preferentially conveys low-FIP ions into the corona, the source plasma that eventually will be shock-accelerated as SEPs originates in magnetic structures where Alfv\u00e9n waves resonate with the loop length on closed magnetic field lines. This concentrates FIP fractionation near the top of the chromosphere. Meanwhile, the source of the SSW may lie near the base of diverging open-field lines surrounding, but outside of, active regions, where such resonance does not exist, allowing fractionation throughout the chromosphere. We also find that energetic particles accelerated from the solar wind itself by shock waves at corotating interaction regions, generally beyond 1 AU, confirm the FIP pattern of the solar wind.",

When these centroid positions are plotted and analyzed as functions of time from each sunspot cycle maximum, there appear to be systematic differences in the positions and equatorward drift rates as a function of sunspot cycle amplitude. If, instead, these centroid positions are plotted and analyzed as functions of time from each sunspot cycle minimum, then most of the differences in the positions and equatorward drift rates disappear. The differences that remain disappear entirely if curve fitting is used to determine the starting times (which vary by as much as eight months from the times of minima). The sunspot zone latitudes and equatorward drift measured relative to this starting time follow a standard path for all cycles with no dependence upon cycle strength or hemispheric dominance. Although Cycle 23 was peculiar in its length and the strength of the polar fields it produced, it too shows no significant variation from this standard. This standard law, and the lack of variation with sunspot cycle characteristics, is consistent with dynamo wave mechanisms but not consistent with current flux transport dynamo models for the equatorward drift of the sunspot zones.",

         "abstract": "We have detected several periodicities in the solar equatorial rotation rate of sunspot groups in the catalog Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during the period 1931 - 1976, the Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) during the period 1977 - 2014, and the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during the period 1974 - 2014. We have compared the results from the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the maximum entropy method (MEM), and the Morlet wavelet power-spectra of the equatorial rotation rates determined from SOON and DPD sunspot-group data during the period 1986 - 2007 with those of the Mount Wilson Doppler-velocity data during the same period determined by Javaraiah et al. ( Solar Phys. 257, 61, 2009). We have also compared the power-spectra computed from the DPD and the combined GPR and SOON sunspot-group data during the period 1974 - 2014 to those from the GPR sunspot-group data during the period 1931 - 1973. Our results suggest a \u223c 250-day period in the equatorial rotation rate determined from both the Mt. Wilson Doppler-velocity data and the sunspot-group data during 1986 - 2007. However, a wavelet analysis reveals that this periodicity appears mostly around 1991 in the velocity data, while it is present in most of the solar cycles covered by the sunspot-group data, mainly near the minimum epochs of the solar cycles. We also found the signature of a period of \u223c 1.4 years in the velocity data during 1990 - 1995, and in the equatorial rotation rate of sunspot groups mostly around the year 1956. The equatorial rotation rate of sunspot groups reveals a strong \u223c 1.6-year periodicity around 1933 and 1955, a weaker one around 1976, and a strong \u223c 1.8-year periodicity around 1943. Our analysis also suggests periodicities of \u223c 5 years, \u223c 7 years, and \u223c 17 years, as well as some other short-term periodicities. However, short-term periodicities are mostly present at the time of solar minima. Hence, short-term periodicities cannot be confirmed because of the larger uncertainty in the data.",

         "abstract": "The Maunder Minimum (1645 - 1715) was unique in terms of solar-cycle amplitudes and sunspot-position distributions registered in the last four centuries; however, little is known for its recovery and transition to the regular solar cycles until 1749 and the existing reconstructions vary from one to another here. This article presents a snapshot of Solar Cycle \u22123 including sunspot observations by Johann Christoph M\u00fcller (hereafter, JCM) in 1719 - 1720. We identified his sunspot drawings in the manuscript department of the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg and compiled his biographical profile and observational expertise. Subsequently, we analysed his sunspot drawings and derived the group number and positions of the observed sunspots. The results and comparative analyses with contemporary observations revealed that JCM reported up to five sunspot groups, corresponding well with Sebastian Alischer's records but contrasting with Johann Rost's records in the existing databases. These comparisons indicated that Rost's extremely large values recorded in 1719 - 1720 probably represented individual sunspot numbers instead of sunspot group numbers, unlike the understanding in the existing databases. Accordingly, JCM's group number forms a robust reference for representing the solar activity in 1719 - 1720 and exhibits relatively moderate solar cycle amplitude in the immediate aftermath of the Maunder Minimum. Moreover, JCM's sunspot drawings provide significantly detailed information on sunspot positions. Our analyses could locate the reported sunspot groups in both solar hemispheres, unlike those in the Maunder Minimum, which support the suggested transition between Solar Cycles \u22124 and \u22123.",

         "abstract": "Daily records of sunspot group areas compiled by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from May of 1874 through 1976 indicate a curious history for the penumbral areas of the smaller sunspot groups. On average, the ratio of penumbral area to umbral area in a sunspot group increases from 5 to 6 as the total sunspot group area increases from 100 to 2000 \u03bcHem (a \u03bcHem is 10<SUP>-6</SUP> the area of a solar hemisphere). This relationship does not vary substantially with sunspot group latitude or with the phase of the sunspot cycle. However, for the sunspot groups with total areas &lt; 100 \u03bcHem, this ratio changes dramatically and systematically through this historical record. The ratio for these smallest sunspots is near 5.5 from 1874 to 1900. After a rapid rise to more than 7 in 1905, it drops smoothly to less than 3 by 1930 and then rises smoothly back to more than 7 in 1961. It then returns to near 5.5 from 1965 to 1976. The smooth variation from 1905 to 1961 shows no indication of any step-like changes that might be attributed to changes in equipment or personnel. The overall level of solar activity was increasing monotonically during this time period when the penumbra-to-umbra area ratio dropped to less than half its peak value and then returned. If this history can be confirmed by other observations ( e.g. Mt. Wilson or Kodaikanal), it may impact our understanding of penumbra formation, our dynamo models, and our estimates of historical changes in the solar irradiance.",

         "abstract": "In this work we study the mid-term periodicities (MTPs), between 1 and 2 years, of the sunspot groups and the flare index (FI), by separating the data into hemispheres and spectral bands (SBs) according to the most significant periodicities presented by these phenomena. We found that the MTP of sunspot groups has a diminished power during the Modern Minimum and an increased power during the Modern Maximum, with the exception of cycle 20. For flares, the MTP has a diminished power during the low activity cycle 20, and an increased power during cycles 21 and 22. Therefore, for both sunspot groups and FI, cycle 20 shows a very diminished power followed by the active and higher-power cycles 21 and 22; cycle 23 shows a weaker power than cycles 21 and 22. It is uncertain whether MTP can be a precursor of a long-term minimum of solar activity or not, as has been previously suggested. Also, there is no one-to-one correlation between the cycle intensity and the importance of MTP. Concerning the quasi-biennial periodicities and the theory of two kinds of dynamos, we notice the tendency that higher-power cycles mean weaker coupling in the model. Concerning the hemispheric north-south asymmetry, for sunspot groups the southern hemisphere dominates in most of the SBs, while for FI the northern hemisphere dominates for all the SBs. Additionally, the time lag found between the two hemispheres indicates that the degrees of coupling in the photosphere for sunspot groups and in the corona for flares are between moderate and strong. Finally, the modulation shown by the MTP time series suggests that these periodicities are the product of chaotic quasi-periodic processes and not of stochastic processes.",

         "abstract": "The solar wind is filled with various magnetic field fluctuations, and one of the most widespread types of such fluctuations is solar wind discontinuities. They are rapid high-amplitude magnetic field rotations sharing properties of nonlinear Alfv\u00e9n waves and plane plasma slabs. They are believed to play an important role in the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. Most studies of solar wind discontinuities are based on observations in pristine solar wind, often by solar wind monitors at L1. However, before interacting with the Earth's magnetosphere, solar wind discontinuities cross the bow shock and can change their properties. In this study, we investigate the transformation of discontinuities due to the bow shock crossing. We compiled a set of 100 high-amplitude (&gt;3 nT) discontinuities observed by ARTEMIS in the upstream of the bow shock and by THEMIS in the downstream from the bow shock crossing (in the Earth's magnetosheath). Comparison of discontinuity properties in the solar wind and magnetosheath demonstrates discontinuity thinning and current density increase in the magnetosheath. Although all considered solar wind discontinuities mostly resemble rotational discontinuities, in the magnetosheath they start having properties of tangential discontinuities. We reveal a clear dawn-dusk asymmetry of discontinuity properties that are likely related to the asymmetry of the ion foreshock. We discuss how solar wind discontinuity transformation at the bow shock crossing can alter their interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.",

         "abstract": "Attention is drawn to the existence of errors in the original digital dataset containing sunspot data extracted from certain sections of the printed Greenwich Photo-heliographic Results ( GPR) 1874 - 1976. Calculating the polar coordinates from the heliographic coordinates and comparing them with the recorded polar coordinates reveals that there are both isolated and systematic errors in the original sunspot digital dataset, particularly during the early years (1874 - 1914). It should be noted that most of these errors are present in the compiled sunspot digital dataset and not in the original printed copies of the Greenwich Photo-heliographic Results. Surprisingly, many of the errors in the digitised positions of sunspot groups are apparently in the measured polar coordinates, not the derived heliographic coordinates. The mathematical equations that are used to convert between heliographic and polar coordinate systems are formulated and then used to calculate revised (digitised) polar coordinates for sunspot groups, on the assumption that the heliographic coordinates of every sunspot group are correct. The additional complication of requiring accurate solar ephemerides in order to solve the mathematical equations is discussed in detail. It is shown that the isolated and systematic errors, which are prevalent in the sunspot digital dataset during the early years, disappear if revised polar coordinates are used instead. A comprehensive procedure for checking the original sunspot digital dataset is formulated in an Appendix.",

(Solar Phys.289, 4365, 2014b) to separate sunspot groups into large sunspot groups (D, E, and F classes in the modified Zurich classification) and simple sunspot groups (A and B classes) in Solar Cycles 22 - 24 collected by the United States Air Force/Mount Wilson Observatory (USAF/MWL). Then, using lagged-cross-correlation analysis and the block-bootstrap method, we calculate the correlation coefficients against time lags and determine the statistical significance of phase relation between large and simple sunspot groups in Solar Cycles 22 - 24, respectively. The main results that we obtained are summarized as follows: i) During Solar Cycles 22 and 24, the results - large sunspot groups lead or lag simple sunspot groups - are statistically insignificant and large sunspot groups should be in phase with simple sunspot groups. ii) During Solar Cycle 23, large sunspot groups statistically significantly lag simple sunspot groups in temporal phase.",

         "abstract": "We analyze the multiwavelength observations of an M2.9/1N flare that occurred in the active region (AR) NOAA 11112 in the vicinity of a huge filament system on 16 October 2010. SDO/HMI magnetograms reveal the emergence of a bipole (within the existing AR) 50 hours prior to the flare event. During the emergence, both the positive and negative sunspots in the bipole show translational as well as rotational motion. The positive-polarity sunspot shows significant motion/rotation in the south-westward/clockwise direction, and we see continuously pushing/sliding of the surrounding opposite-polarity field region. On the other hand, the negative-polarity sunspot moves/rotates in the westward/anticlockwise direction. The positive-polarity sunspot rotates \u2248 70<SUP>\u2218</SUP> within 30 hours, whereas the one with negative polarity rotates \u2248 20<SUP>\u2218</SUP> within 10 hours. SDO/AIA 94 \u00c5 EUV images show the emergence of a flux tube in the corona, consistent with the emergence of the bipole in HMI. The footpoints of the flux tube were anchored in the emerging bipole. The initial brightening starts at one of the footpoints (western) of the emerging loop system, where the positive-polarity sunspot pushes/slides towards a nearby negative-polarity field region. A high speed plasmoid ejection (speed \u2248 1197 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) was observed during the impulsive phase of the flare, which suggests magnetic reconnection of the emerging positive-polarity sunspot with the surrounding opposite-polarity field region. The entire AR shows positive-helicity injection before the flare event. Moreover, the newly emerging bipole reveals the signature of a negative (left-handed) helicity. These observations provide unique evidence of the emergence of twisted flux tubes from below the photosphere to coronal heights, triggering a flare mainly due to the interaction between the emerging positive-polarity sunspot and a nearby negative-polarity sunspot by the shearing motion of the emerging positive sunspot towards the negative one. Our observations also strongly support the idea that the rotation can most likely be attributed to the emergence of twisted magnetic fields, as proposed by recent models.",

We have computed the number of sunspot groups and individual sunspots and extracted the positions of all individual sunspots recorded by Oriani. It must be highlighted that the observations made by Oriani in 1779 are not included in the current sunspot-group number database. The observations made in 1778 were already included, but we have found important deficiencies in these values that underestimated the true level of solar activity. The highest daily number of groups recorded by Oriani was 12 (24 August 1778). Only Horrebow in Solar Cycle 2 observed a higher daily number of groups (up to 16 groups in 1769) in the second half of the 18th century. We have compared the sunspot observations made by Oriani and Staudacher for the common dates. In general, Oriani observed a few more groups than Staudacher, while Staudacher recorded more individual sunspots than Oriani. Furthermore, the sunspot positions recorded by both observers are similar, but some significant differences can be found. Finally, we want to highlight that the sunspot records made in the 18th century will help us to understand better the behavior of the long-term solar activity. Therefore, we need to improve the observational coverage of the sunspot records carried out in that century.",

         "abstract": "We use sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) to investigate the effects of intercalibrating data from observers with different visual acuities. The tests are made by counting the number of groups [R<SUB>B</SUB>] above a variable cut-off threshold of observed total whole spot area (uncorrected for foreshortening) to simulate what a lower-acuity observer would have seen. The synthesised annual means of R<SUB>B</SUB> are then re-scaled to the full observed RGO group number [R<SUB>A</SUB>] using a variety of regression techniques. It is found that a very high correlation between R<SUB>A</SUB> and R<SUB>B</SUB> (r_{AB} &gt; 0.98) does not prevent large errors in the intercalibration (for example sunspot-maximum values can be over 30 % too large even for such levels of r_{AB}). In generating the backbone sunspot number [R_{BB}], Svalgaard and Schatten ( Solar Phys., 2016) force regression fits to pass through the scatter-plot origin, which generates unreliable fits (the residuals do not form a normal distribution) and causes sunspot-cycle amplitudes to be exaggerated in the intercalibrated data. It is demonstrated that the use of Quantile-Quantile (\"Q-Q\") plots to test for a normal distribution is a useful indicator of erroneous and misleading regression fits. Ordinary least-squares linear fits, not forced to pass through the origin, are sometimes reliable (although the optimum method used is shown to be different when matching peak and average sunspot-group numbers). However, other fits are only reliable if non-linear regression is used. From these results it is entirely possible that the inflation of solar-cycle amplitudes in the backbone group sunspot number as one goes back in time, relative to related solar-terrestrial parameters, is entirely caused by the use of inappropriate and non-robust regression techniques to calibrate the sunspot data.",

He carried out his sunspot observations from 1830 to 1843, just after the Dalton Minimum. We have recovered 71 observation days for this observer. Unfortunately, many of these records are qualitative and we could only obtain the number of sunspot groups and/or single sunspots from 25 observations. However, we highlight the importance of these records because Colla is not included in the sunspot group database as an observer and, therefore, neither are his sunspot observations. With regards to the number of groups, the sunspot observations made by Colla are similar to those of several observers of his time. For common observation days, only Stark recorded significantly more groups than Colla. Moreover, we have calculated the sunspot areas and positions from Colla's sunspot drawings concluding that both areas and positions recorded by this observer seem unreal. Therefore, Colla's drawings can be interpreted such as sketches showing reliable information on the number of groups but the information on sunspot areas and positions should not be used for scientific purposes.",

Galilei's letters to Cardinal Francesco Barberini and Marcus Welser contain daily solar observations on 3 - 11 May, 2 June - 8 July, and 19 - 21 August 1612. These historical archives do not provide the time of observation, which results in uncertainty in the sunspot coordinates. To obtain them, we present a method that minimizes the discrepancy between the sunspot latitudes. We provide areas and heliographic coordinates of 82 sunspot groups. In contrast to Sheiner's butterfly diagram, we found only one sunspot group near the Equator. This provides a higher reliability of Galilei's drawings. Large sunspot groups are found to emerge at the same longitude in the northern hemisphere from 3 May to 21 August, which indicates an active longitude.",

         "abstract": "Although W. Brunner began to weight sunspot counts (from 1926), using a method whereby larger spots were counted more than once, he compensated for the weighting by not counting enough smaller spots in order to maintain the same reduction factor (0.6) as was used by his predecessor A. Wolfer to reduce the count to R. Wolf's original scale, so that the weighting did not have any effect on the scale of the sunspot number. In 1947, M. Waldmeier formalized the weighting (on a scale from 1 to 5) of the sunspot count made at Zurich and its auxiliary station Locarno. This explicit counting method, when followed, inflates the relative sunspot number over that which corresponds to the scale set by Wolfer (and matched by Brunner). Recounting some 60,000 sunspots on drawings from the reference station Locarno shows that the number of sunspots reported was \"over counted\" by {\u2248} 44 % on average, leading to an inflation (measured by an effective weight factor) in excess of 1.2 for high solar activity. In a double-blind parallel counting by the Locarno observer M. Cagnotti, we determined that Svalgaard's count closely matches that of Cagnotti, allowing us to determine from direct observation the daily weight factor for spots since 2003 (and sporadically before). The effective total inflation turns out to have two sources: a major one (15 - 18 %) caused by weighting of spots, and a minor source (4 - 5 %) caused by the introduction of the Z\u00fcrich classification of sunspot groups which increases the group count by 7 - 8 % and the relative sunspot number by about half that. We find that a simple empirical equation (depending on the activity level) fits the observed factors well, and use that fit to estimate the weighting inflation factor for each month back to the introduction of effective inflation in 1947 and thus to be able to correct for the over-counts and to reduce sunspot counting to the Wolfer method in use from 1894 onwards.",

The ratio of the sunspot number to the width of the SGZ shows saturation at a certain level of the sunspot number, and above this level the increase of the activity takes place mostly due to the expansion of the SGZ. It is shown that the mean latitudes of sunspots can be reconstructed from the amplitudes of solar activity. Using the obtained relations and the group sunspot numbers by Hoyt and Schatten ( Solar Phys. 179, 189, 1998), the latitude distribution of sunspot groups (\"the Maunder butterfly diagram\") for the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries is reconstructed and compared with historical sunspot observations.",

         "abstract": "Large sunspots can be observed with the unaided eye under suitable atmospheric seeing conditions. Such observations are of particular value because the frequency of their appearance provides an approximate indication of the prevailing level of solar activity. Unaided-eye sunspot observations can be traced back well before the start of telescopic observations of the Sun, especially in the East Asian historical records. It is therefore important to compare more modern, unaided-eye sunspot observations with the results of telescopic sunspot observations, to gain a better understanding of the nature of the unaided-eye sunspot records. A previous comparison of Chinese unaided-eye sunspot records and Greenwich photo-heliographic results between 1874 and 1918 indicated that a few of the unaided-eye observations were apparently not supported by direct photographic evidence of at least one sunspot with a large area. This article reveals that one of such Chinese unaided-eye observations had possibly captured the transit of Venus on 9 December 1874. The Chinese sunspot records on this date are compared with Western sunspot observations on the same day. It is concluded that sunspots on the solar disk were quite small and the transit of Venus was probably misinterpreted as a sunspot (black spot) by the Chinese local intellectuals. This case indicates that sunspots or comparable \"obscuring\" objects with an area as large as 1000 millionths of the solar disk could reasonably have been seen with the unaided eye under suitable seeing conditions. It also confirms the visibility of sunspots near the solar limb with the unaided eye. This study provides an explanation of the apparent discrepancy between the Chinese unaided-eye sunspot observation on 9 December 1874 and the Western sunspot observations using telescopes, as well as a basis for further discussion on the negative pairs in 1900 and 1911, apparently without sufficiently large area.",

         "abstract": "Pierre Gassendi (1592 - 1655) carried out sunspot observations during the 1630s. This period is particularly interesting because it occurred a few years before the Maunder Minimum. Gassendi was the second most active sunspot observer in that decade, surpassed only by Christoph Scheiner. Moreover, the sunspot observations made by Gassendi are of interest because most of them were made in days when no other sunspot observations were available. We have analyzed the sunspot drawings included in his Complete Works (Opera Omnia) and the textual reports with sunspot information after translating them from the original Latin. Thus, we have detected mistakes in previous works that studied these observations, such as incorrect dates and incorrect daily number of groups assigned to Gassendi. In addition, we found some observation days recorded by Gassendi not included in the current sunspot-group-number database. In this work, we provide a new account of the number of groups recorded by Gassendi in addition to the translations of his relevant texts on observed sunspots. Our main objective is to include these new recounts into the current sunspot-group-number database, which is the basis of the group-number index, to have a more accurate knowledge of solar activity of the third solar cycle observed with the aid of the telescope.",

         "abstract": "The sunspot number is analyzed by using detailed sunspot data, including aspects of observability, sunspot sizes, and proper identification of sunspot groups as discrete entities of solar activity. The tests show that in addition to the subjective factors there are also objective causes of the ambiguities in the series of sunspot numbers. To introduce an alternative solar-activity measure, the physical meaning of the sunspot number has to be reconsidered. It contains two components whose numbers are governed by different physical mechanisms and this is one source of the ambiguity. This article suggests an activity index, which is the amount of emerged magnetic flux. The only long-term proxy measure is the detailed sunspot-area dataset with proper calibration to the magnetic flux. The Debrecen sunspot databases provide an appropriate source for the establishment of the suggested activity index.",

A large portion (up to \u2248 30<SUP>\u2218</SUP> latitude) of the mean differential-rotation profile of the sunspot groups lies between those of the internal differential-rotation rates at 0.94R<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and 0.98R<SUB>\u2299</SUB>. The variation in the yearly mean equatorial-rotation rate of the sunspot groups seems to be lagging behind that of the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the GONG measurements by one to two years. The amplitude of the GONG measurements is very small. The solar-cycle variation in the equatorial-rotation rate of the solar corona closely matches that determined from the sunspot-group data. The variation in the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the Mount Wilson Doppler-velocity data closely resembles the corresponding variation in the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the sunspot-group data that included the values of the abnormal angular motions (&gt; |3<SUP>\u2218</SUP>| day<SUP>-1</SUP>) of the sunspot groups.

We highlight Bond was the observer with the highest daily number of sunspot groups observed in Solar Cycle 9 recording 18 groups on 26 December 1848 according to the current sunspot group database. However, we have detected significant mistakes in these counts due to the use of sunspot position tables instead of solar drawings. Therefore, we have revisited the sunspot observations made by Bond, establishing a new group counting. Our new counts of the sunspot groups from Bond's drawings indicate that solar activity was previously overestimated. Moreover, after this new counting, Bond would not be the astronomer who recorded the highest daily group number for Solar Cycle 9 but Schmidt with 16 groups on 14 February 1849. We have also indicated the new highest annual group numbers recorded by any observer for the period 1847-1849 in order to correct those values applied in the \"brightest star\" method, which is used as a rough indicator of the solar activity level. Furthermore, a comparison between Bond's sunspot records and the sunspot observations made by Schwabe and Wolf is shown. We conclude that the statistics of Wolf and Bond are similar as regards the group count. Additionally, Schwabe was able to observe smaller groups than Bond.",

         "abstract": "Potential sources of inhomogeneity in the sunspot measurements published by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, during the early interval 1874 - 1885 are examined critically. Particular attention is paid to inhomogeneities that might arise because the sunspot measurements were derived from solar photographs taken at various contributing solar observatories, which used different telescopes, experienced different seeing conditions, and employed different photographic processes. The procedures employed in the Solar Department at the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), Herstmonceux, during the final phase of sunspot observations provide a modern benchmark for interpreting the early sunspot measurements. The different observing telescopes used at the contributing solar observatories during the interval 1874 - 1885 are discussed in detail, using information gleaned from the official RGO publications and other relevant historical documents. Likewise, the different photographic processes employed at the different solar observatories are reviewed carefully. The procedures used by RGO staff to measure the positions and areas of sunspot groups on photographs of the Sun having a nominal radius of either four or eight inches are described. It is argued that the learning curve for the use of the Kew photoheliograph at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, actually commenced in 1858, not 1874. The RGO daily number of sunspot groups is plotted graphically and analysed statistically. Similarly, the changes of metadata at each solar observatory are shown on the graphical plots and analysed statistically. It is concluded that neither the interleaving of data from the different solar observatories nor the changes in metadata invalidates the RGO count of the number of sunspot groups, which behaves as a quasi-homogeneous time series. Furthermore, it is emphasised that the correct treatment of days without photographs is quite crucial to the correct calculation of Group Sunspot Numbers.",

Statistical parameters are derived for each solar cycle using \"Monthly\" and \"Monthly smoothed\" ( SSN) data of international sunspot number ( R <SUB>i</SUB>). Primarily the variability in monthly sunspot number during different phases of the solar cycle is considered along with other statistical parameters that are computed using solar cycle characteristics, like ascent time, peak sunspot number and the length of the solar cycle. Using these statistical parameters, two mathematical formulae are developed to compute the quantities [ Q <SUB>C</SUB>]<SUB> n </SUB> and [ L]<SUB> n </SUB> for each nth solar cycle. It is found that the peak sunspot number and ascent time of the n+1th solar cycle correlates well with the parameters [ Q <SUB>C</SUB>]<SUB> n </SUB> and [ L]<SUB> n </SUB>/[ S <SUB>Max</SUB>]<SUB> n+1</SUB> and gives a correlation coefficient of 0.97 and 0.92, respectively.

Three different methods, which are commonly used to define solar cycle characteristics are used and mathematical relations developed for forecasting peak sunspot number and ascent time of the upcoming solar cycle, are examined separately.",

         "abstract": "The nature of the three-minute and five-minute oscillations observed in sunspots is considered to be an effect of propagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves from the photosphere to the solar corona. However, the real modes of these waves and the nature of the filters that result in rather narrow frequency bands of these modes are still far from being generally accepted, in spite of a large amount of observational material obtained in a wide range of wave bands. The significance of this field of research is based on the hope that local seismology can be used to find the structure of the solar atmosphere in magnetic tubes of sunspots. We expect that substantial progress can be achieved by simultaneous observations of the sunspot oscillations in different layers of the solar atmosphere in order to gain information on propagating waves. In this study we used a new method that combines the results of an oscillation study made in optical and radio observations. The optical spectral measurements in photospheric and chromospheric lines of the line-of-sight velocity were carried out at the Sayan Solar Observatory. The radio maps of the Sun were obtained with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 1.76 cm. Radio sources associated with the sunspots were analyzed to study the oscillation processes in the chromosphere - corona transition region in the layer with magnetic field B=2000 G. A high level of instability of the oscillations in the optical and radio data was found. We used a wavelet analysis for the spectra. The best similarities of the spectra of oscillations obtained by the two methods were detected in the three-minute oscillations inside the sunspot umbra for the dates when the active regions were situated near the center of the solar disk. A comparison of the wavelet spectra for optical and radio observations showed a time delay of about 50 seconds of the radio results with respect to the optical ones. This implies an MHD wave traveling upward inside the umbral magnetic tube of the sunspot. For the five-minute oscillations the similarity in spectral details could be found only for optical oscillations at the chromospheric level in the umbral region or very close to it. The time delays seem to be similar. Besides three-minute and five-minute ones, oscillations with longer periods (8 and 15 minutes) were detected in optical and radio records. Their nature still requires further observational and theoretical study for even a preliminary discussion.",

         "abstract": "Solar activity is generally periodic in nature, having a main periodicity of \u2248 11 years, known as the solar cycle. Sunspots are one of the visible indicators of this cycle, and its different characteristics have been known for many years. Due to the presence of irregularities - long and short-term trends, stochasticity, etc. - it is difficult to predict solar activity. In sunspot cycles, amplitude and duration are highly varying parameters, making their prediction challenging. In this study, wavelet analysis of sunspot numbers for the period 1819 - 2019 is carried out to find the long- and short-term periodic variations in different cycles and changes in cycle duration. The assumptions of the flux-transport dynamo model of the sunspot cycle are used as the basis for the interpretation of the results. The results bring out 10.1-, 10.8-, and 11.6-year periods as the basic periodicities of the sunspot cycle and the ones having the highest strength in a sunspot cycle. Further, their amplitudes have been found to depend on whether the solar cycle belongs to a grand episode or a regular one. Solar-cycle duration is mainly determined by the length of the basic periodicities of the sunspot cycle, and major irregularities in the duration of Solar Cycles 9, 20, and 23 are caused by modulation of periodic trends. Since all the types of variations shown by the duration of the sunspot cycle appear related to the meridional-flow circulation, the results of the study explain the characteristic changes of this circulation postulated by the flux-transport dynamo model.",

         "abstract": "We investigate how helioseismic waves that originate from effective point sources interact with a sunspot. These waves are reconstructed from observed stochastic wavefields on the Sun by cross-correlating photospheric Doppler-velocity signals. We select the wave sources at different locations relative to the sunspot, and investigate the p- and f-mode waves separately. The results reveal a complicated picture of waveform perturbations caused by the wave interaction with the sunspot. In particular, it is found that for waves originating from outside of the sunspot, p-mode waves travel across the sunspot with a small amplitude reduction and slightly higher speed, and wave amplitude and phase get mostly restored to the quiet-Sun values after passing the sunspot. The f-mode wave experiences some amplitude reduction passing through the sunspot, and the reduced amplitude is not recovered after that. The wave-propagation speed does not change before encountering the sunspot and inside the sunspot, but the wavefront becomes faster than the reference wave after passing through the sunspot. For waves originating from inside the sunspot umbra, both f- and p-mode waves show significant amplitude reductions and faster speed for all propagation paths. A comparison of positive and negative time lags of cross-correlation functions shows an apparent asymmetry in the waveform changes for both the f- and p-mode waves. We suggest that the waveform variations of the helioseismic waves interacting with a sunspot found in this article can be used for developing a method of waveform heliotomography, similar to the waveform tomography of the Earth.",

The comparisons are made for the original Solar Influences Data Center (SIDC) composite of Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number [R_{{ISNv}1}], the group sunspot number [R<SUB>G</SUB>] by Hoyt and Schatten ( Solar Phys. 181, 491, 1998), the new \"backbone\" group sunspot number [R_{BB}] by Svalgaard and Schatten ( Solar Phys., DOI: 10.1007/s11207-015-0815-8, 2016), and the \"corrected\" sunspot number [R<SUB>C</SUB>] by Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard ( J. Geophys. Res. 119, 5172, 2014a). Each sunspot number is fitted with terrestrial observations, or parameters derived from terrestrial observations to be linearly proportional to sunspot number, over a 30-year calibration interval of 1982 - 2012. The fits are then used to compute test sequences, which extend further back in time and which are compared to R_{{ISNv}1}, R<SUB>G</SUB>, R_{{BB}}, and R<SUB>C</SUB>. To study the long-term trends, comparisons are made using averages over whole solar cycles (minimum-to-minimum). The test variations are generated in four ways: i) using the IDV(1d) and IDV geomagnetic indices (for 1845 - 2013) fitted over the calibration interval using the various sunspot numbers and the phase of the solar cycle; ii) from the open solar flux (OSF) generated for 1845 - 2013 from four pairings of geomagnetic indices by Lockwood et al. ( Ann. Geophys. 32, 383, 2014a) and analysed using the OSF continuity model of Solanki, Sch\u00fcssler, and Fligge ( Nature, 408, 445, 2000), which employs a constant fractional OSF loss rate; iii) the same OSF data analysed using the OSF continuity model of Owens and Lockwood ( J. Geophys. Res. 117, A04102, 2012), in which the fractional loss rate varies with the tilt of the heliospheric current sheet and hence with the phase of the solar cycle; iv) the occurrence frequency of low-latitude aurora for 1780 - 1980 from the survey of Legrand and Simon ( Ann. Geophys. 5, 161, 1987). For all cases, R_{BB} exceeds the test terrestrial series by an amount that increases as one goes back in time.",

The aim is to study different-frequency spatial distribution characteristics above sunspots and faculae and their dependence on magnetic-field features and to detect the oscillations that reach the corona from the deep photosphere most effectively. We used Fast-Fourier-Transform and frequency filtration of the intensity and Doppler-velocity variations with a Morlet wavelet to trace the waves that propagate from the photosphere to the chromosphere and corona. The spatial distribution of low-frequency (1 - 2 mHz) oscillations clearly outlines the fan-loop structures in the corona (the Fe ix 171 \u00c5 line) above sunspots and faculae. High-frequency oscillations (5 - 7 mHz) are concentrated in fragments inside boundaries of the photospheric umbra and close to facular-region centers. This implies that the upper parts of most coronal loops, which transfer low-frequency oscillations from the photosphere, are located in the Fe ix 171 \u00c5 line-formation layer. We used the relations of the dominant frequency vs. distance from barycenter to estimate the magnetic-tube inclination angle in the higher layers, which poses difficulties for direct magnetic-field measurements. According to our calculations, this angle is \u2248 40\u00b0 in the transition region around the umbra borders. Phase velocities measured in the coronal loop upper parts in the Fe ix 171 \u00c5 line-formation layer reach 100 - 150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for sunspots and 50 - 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for faculae.",

         "abstract": "The daily number of sunspot groups on the solar disk, as recorded by the programme of sunspot observations performed under the aegis of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, UK, and subsequently the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), is re-examined for the interval 1874 - 1885. The motivation for this re-examination is the key role that the RGO number of sunspot groups plays in the calculation of Group Sunspot Numbers (Hoyt and Schatten in Solar Phys. 179, 189, 1998a; Solar Phys. 181, 491, 1998b). A new dataset has been derived for the RGO daily number of sunspot groups in the interval 1874 - 1885. This new dataset attempts to achieve complete consistency between the sunspot data presented in the three main sections of the RGO publications and also incorporates all known errata and additions. It is argued that days for which no RGO solar photograph was acquired originally should be regarded, without exception, as being days without meaningful sunspot data. The daily number of sunspot groups that Hoyt and Schatten assign to days without RGO photographs is frequently just a lower limit. Moreover, in the absence of a solar photograph, the daily number of sunspot groups is inevitably uncertain because of the known frequent occurrence of sunspot groups that exist for just a single day. The elimination of days without photographs changes the list of inter-comparison days on which both the primary RGO observer and a specified secondary comparison observer saw at least one sunspot group. The resulting changes in the personal correction factors of secondary observers then change the personal correction factors of overlapping tertiary observers, etc. In this way, numerical changes in the personal correction factors of secondary observers propagate away from the interval 1874 - 1885, thereby potentially changing the arithmetical calculation of Group Sunspot Numbers over an appreciably wider time interval.",

         "abstract": "We use five test data series to search for, and quantify, putative discontinuities around 1946 in five different annual-mean sunspot-number or sunspot-group-number data sequences. The data series tested are the original and new versions of the Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number composite [R_{{ISNv1}} and R_{{ISNv2}}] (respectively Clette et al. in Adv. Space Res. 40, 919, 2007 and Clette et al. in The Solar Activity Cycle 35, Springer, New York, 2015); the corrected version of R <SUB>ISNv1</SUB> proposed by Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard ( J. Geophys. Res. 119, 5193, 2014a) [R <SUB>C</SUB>]; the new \"backbone\" group-number composite proposed by Svalgaard and Schatten ( Solar Phys. 291, 2016) [R_{{BB}}]; and the new group-number composite derived by Usoskin et al. ( Solar Phys. 291, 2016) [R_{{UEA}}]. The test data series used are the group-number [N<SUB>G</SUB>] and total sunspot area [A <SUB>G</SUB>] from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich/Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) photoheliographic data; the Ca K index from the recent re-analysis of Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) spectroheliograms in the Calcium ii K ion line; the sunspot-group-number from the MWO sunspot drawings [N_{{MWO}}]; and the dayside ionospheric F2-region critical frequencies measured by the Slough ionosonde [foF2]. These test data all vary in close association with sunspot numbers, in some cases non-linearly. The tests are carried out using both the before-and-after fit-residual comparison method and the correlation method of Lockwood, Owens, and Barnard, applied to annual mean data for intervals iterated to minimise errors and to eliminate uncertainties associated with the precise date of the putative discontinuity. It is not assumed that the correction required is by a constant factor, nor even linear in sunspot number. It is shown that a non-linear correction is required by R<SUB>C</SUB>, R_{BB}, and R_{{ISNv1}}, but not by R_{{ISNv2}} or R_{{UEA}}. The five test datasets give very similar results in all cases. By multiplying the probability distribution functions together, we obtain the optimum correction for each sunspot dataset that must be applied to pre-discontinuity data to make them consistent with the post-discontinuity data. It is shown that, on average, values for 1932 - 1943 are too low (relative to later values) by about 12.3 % for R_{{ISNv1}} but are too high for R_{{ISNv2}} and R_{BB} by 3.8 % and 5.2 %, respectively. The correction that was applied to generate R<SUB>C</SUB> from R <SUB>ISNv1</SUB> reduces this average factor to 0.5 % but does not remove the non-linear variation with the test data, and other errors remain uncorrected. A valuable test of the procedures used is provided by R_{{UEA}}, which is identical to the RGO N<SUB>G</SUB> values over the interval employed.",

         "abstract": "More than 70 years ago, it was recognised that ionospheric F2-layer critical frequencies [foF2] had a strong relationship to sunspot number. Using historic datasets from the Slough and Washington ionosondes, we evaluate the best statistical fits of foF2 to sunspot numbers (at each Universal Time [UT] separately) in order to search for drifts and abrupt changes in the fit residuals over Solar Cycles 17 - 21. This test is carried out for the original composite of the Wolf/Z\u00fcrich/International sunspot number [R], the new \"backbone\" group sunspot number [R_{BB}], and the proposed \"corrected sunspot number\" [R<SUB>C</SUB>]. Polynomial fits are made both with and without allowance for the white-light facular area, which has been reported as being associated with cycle-to-cycle changes in the sunspot-number-foF2 relationship. Over the interval studied here, R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> largely differ in their allowance for the \"Waldmeier discontinuity\" around 1945 (the correction factor for which for R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> is, respectively, zero, effectively over 20 %, and explicitly 11.6 %). It is shown that for Solar Cycles 18 - 21, all three sunspot data sequences perform well, but that the fit residuals are lowest and most uniform for R_{BB}. We here use foF2 for those UTs for which R, R_{BB}, and R<SUB>C</SUB> all give correlations exceeding 0.99 for intervals both before and after the Waldmeier discontinuity. The error introduced by the Waldmeier discontinuity causes R to underestimate the fitted values based on the foF2 data for 1932 - 1945, but R_{BB} overestimates them by almost the same factor, implying that the correction for the Waldmeier discontinuity inherent in R_{BB} is too large by a factor of two. Fit residuals are smallest and most uniform for R<SUB>C</SUB>, and the ionospheric data support the optimum discontinuity multiplicative correction factor derived from the independent Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) sunspot group data for the same interval.",

The radial and vertical profiles of pressure, plasma density, and temperature in the visible layers of the sunspot are calculated. The reduction in plasma density in the magnetic funnel of the sunspot, corresponding to the Wilson depression, is also obtained. The magnetic structure of the sunspot is given analytically in a realistic way: a part of the magnetic flux of the sunspot approaches the surrounding photosphere at the outer edge of the penumbra. The magnetic field of the sunspot is not assumed to be axially symmetric. For the first time, the angular dependence of the physical variables in this model allows us to simulate not only a deviation from the circular shape of the sunspot, but also a fine filamentary structure of the sunspot penumbra. The Alfv\u00e9n Mach number (the ratio of the plasma speed to the Alfv\u00e9n speed) is zero at the center of the sunspot and rises slowly toward the periphery of the sunspot; this corresponds to the structure of the Evershed flow in the penumbra. The Evershed flow in our model is mainly concentrated in dark penumbral filaments, as is observed.",

         "abstract": "Designing a statistical solar flare forecasting technique can benefit greatly from knowledge of the flare frequency of occurrence with respect to sunspot groups. This study analyzed sunspot groups and H\u03b1 and X-ray flares reported for the period 1997 - 2007. Annual catalogs were constructed, listing the days that numbered sunspot groups were observed (designated sunspot group-days, SSG-Ds) and for each day a record for each associated H\u03b1 flare of importance category one or greater and normal or bright brightness and for each X-ray flare of intensity C 5 or higher. The catalogs were then analyzed to produce frequency distributions of SSG-Ds by year, sunspot group class, likelihood of producing at least one flare overall and by sunspot group class, and frequency of occurrence of numbers of flares per day and flare intensity category. Only 3% of SSG-Ds produced a substantial H\u03b1 flare and 7% had a significant X-ray flare. We found that mature, complex sunspot groups were more likely than simple sunspot groups to produce a flare, but the latter were more prevalent than the former. More than half of the SSG-Ds with flares had a maximum intensity flare greater than the lowest category (C-class of intensity five and higher). The fact that certain sunspot group classes had flaring probabilities significantly higher than the combined probabilities of the intensity categories when all SSG-Ds were considered suggest that it might be best to first predict the flaring probability. For sunspot groups found likely to flare, a separate diagnosis of maximum flare intensity category appears feasible.",

We identify improved correction factors for reconciling these individual records to a common scale. Our results show that the DPD sunspot group areas are stable over the studied interval (1974 - 2014). We find an improved fit between GPR and DPD sunspot group areas when using a correction factor such that GPR = 0.975(\u00b1 0.006) \u00d7 DPD, independent of the position of the sunspot group on the solar disk. We also find that the scale of KMAS sunspot group areas fits that of DPD well, but has a small position-dependent trend near the limb. However, in order to set SOON sunspot group area records onto the scale of DPD, we find that there is a need for a multivariate correction factor. This multivariate correction factor has a value ranging between 1.1 and 1.9 and is dependent upon the time of the SOON observation, the distance of the group from disk center, and the observatory within the SOON network. Finally, we provide further context to the systematic bias in SOON sunspot group area observations toward lower values relative to those recorded in the GPR and DPD databases that has previously been reported in the literature. We have identified the two main contributors to the SOON area deficit; some penumbral parts are unobserved, and the spot areas are underestimated. Our analysis is vital for studies that require stable, long-term solar activity records such as solar irradiance models that estimate irradiance reduction from records of sunspot group numbers, areas, and locations.",

Individual modal ridges can be clearly seen with reduced power in the k- \u03c9 diagram that is constructed from a 40-hour observation of a stable and round sunspot. Comparing this with the k- \u03c9 diagram obtained from a quiet-Sun region, one sees that inside the sunspot the f-mode ridge is more reduced in power than the p-mode ridges, especially at high wavenumbers. The p-mode ridges all shift toward lower wavenumber (or higher frequency) for a given frequency (or wavenumber), implying an increase of phase velocity beneath the sunspot. This is probably because the acoustic waves travel across the inclined magnetic field of the sunspot penumbra. Line-profile asymmetries exhibited in the p-mode ridges are more significant in the sunspot than in the quiet Sun. Convection inside the sunspot is also highly suppressed, and its characteristic spatial scale is substantially larger than the typical convection scale of the quiet Sun. These observational facts demand a better understanding of magnetoconvection and interactions of helioseismic waves with magnetic field.",

The approach combines a Fokker-Planck description of short-timescale (daily) fluctuations in sunspot number (Noble and Wheatland, Astrophys. J. 732, 5, 2011) with information from other sources, such as precursor and/or dynamo models. The forecasting is illustrated in application to two historical cycles (cycles 19 and 20), and then to the current solar cycle (cycle 24). The new method allows the prediction of quantiles, i.e. the probability that the sunspot number falls outside large or small bounds at a given future time. It also permits Monte Carlo simulations to identify the expected size and timing of the peak daily sunspot number, as well as the smoothed sunspot number for a cycle. These simulations show how the large variance in daily sunspot number determines the actual reliability of any forecast of the smoothed maximum of a cycle. For cycle 24 we forecast a maximum daily sunspot number of 166\u00b124, to occur in March 2013, and a maximum value of the smoothed sunspot number of 66\u00b15, indicating a very small solar cycle.",

In this paper, we introduce the concept of the longest spotless segment (LSS) and examine its statistical relation to selected characteristic points in the sunspot time series (STS), such as the occurrences of first spotless day and sunspot maximum. The analysis has revealed statistically significant relations that appear to be of predictive value. For example, for Cycle 24 the last spotless day during its rising phase should be about August 2012 (\u00b1 9.1 months), the daily maximum sunspot number should be about 227 (\u00b1 50; occurring about January 2014\u00b19.5 months), and the maximum Gaussian smoothed sunspot number should be about 87 (\u00b1 25; occurring about July 2014). Using the Gaussian-filtered values, slightly earlier dates of August 2011 and March 2013 are indicated for the last spotless day and sunspot maximum for Cycle 24, respectively.",

         "abstract": "On 25 August 2012 at 121.7 AU, Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause and measured a magnetic field with a strength of 0.4 nT in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM), while in the inner heliosheath it was 0.2 nT. The magnetic-field orientation was close to the spiral, and its direction did not change during the heliopause crossing. Simultaneously with the increase of magnetic-field magnitude at the heliopause, the number of energetic heliospheric particles and the temperature decreased substantially. At the same time, the Galactic cosmic-ray intensity enhanced together with the plasma density (from near the termination shock to beyond the heliopause). If an increase of the density in the VLISM corresponding to a decrease in the temperature was expected, the strange behavior of the magnetic field causes doubt: did the heliopause-crossing take place? Here we suggest a dynamo mechanism as a possible reason for the observed magnetic-field behavior. We enumerate the necessary conditions for the dynamo process and analyze the Voyager 1 observations to test whether these conditions hold or not. We show that all preconditions are realized and estimate the energy of the dynamo action potential. We conclude that in principle, this process could work just beyond the heliopause, because differential rotation may exist in the nearest part of the outer heliosheath, in a layer where electric conductivity is high, but lower than the field-aligned conductivity in the surrounding regions and where the rotational kinetic-energy density is comparable with the observed magnetic-energy density. The latter circumstance corresponds to a requirement of dynamo action, for which kinetic energy of rotation provided by the Sun is an energy source for magnetic amplification.",

         "abstract": "Coronal structures receive radiation not only from the solar disc, but also from the corona. This height-dependent incident radiation plays a crucial role in the excitation and the ionisation of the illuminated plasma. The aim of this article is to present a method for computing the detailed incident radiation coming from the solar corona, which is perceived at a point located at an arbitrary height. The coronal radiation is calculated by integrating the radiation received at a point in the corona over all of the corona visible from this point. The emission from the corona at all wavelengths of interest is computed using atomic data provided by CHIANTI. We obtain the spectrum illuminating points located at varying heights in the corona at wavelengths between 100 and 912 \u00c5 when photons can ionise H or He atoms and ions in their ground states. As expected, individual spectral lines will contribute most at the height within the corona where the local temperature is closest to their formation temperature. As there are many spectral lines produced by many ions, the coronal intensity cannot be assumed to vary in the same way at all wavelengths and so must be calculated for each separate height that is to be considered. This code can be used to compute the spectrum from the corona illuminating a point at any given height above the solar surface. This brings a necessary improvement to models where an accurate determination of the excitation and ionisation states of coronal plasma structures is crucial.",

         "abstract": "I report observations of unusually strong photospheric and chromospheric velocity oscillations in and near the leading sunspot of NOAA 10781 on 3 July 2005. I investigate an impinging wave as a possible origin of the velocity pattern and the changes of the wave after the passage through the magnetic fields of the sunspot. The wave pattern found consists of a wave with about 3 Mm apparent wavelength, which propagates towards the sunspot. This wave seems to trigger oscillations inside the sunspot\u2019s umbra, which originate from a location inside the penumbra on the side of the impinging wave. The wavelength decreases and the velocity amplitude increases by an order of magnitude in the chromospheric layers inside the sunspot. On the side of the sunspot opposite to the impinging plane wave, circular wave fronts centered on the umbra are seen propagating away from the sunspot outside its outer white-light boundary. They lead to a peculiar ring structure around the sunspot, which is visible in both velocity and intensity maps. The fact that only weak photospheric velocity oscillations are seen in the umbra - contrary to the chromosphere where they peak - highlights the necessity to include the upper solar atmosphere in calculations of wave propagation through spatially and vertically extended magnetic field concentrations such as sunspots.",

We show this phenomenological rule has a physical origin attributable to sunspot formation, evolution, and decay, rather than being due to the changes in sunspot number caused by groups rotating onto and off the visible disc. We also demonstrate a simple method to simulate daily sunspot numbers over a solar cycle using the Pop ( Solar Phys. 276, 351, 2012) result, together with a model for the cycle variation in the mean sunspot number. The procedure is applied to three recent solar cycles. We check that the simulated sunspot numbers reproduce the observed distribution of daily changes over those cycles.",

         "abstract": "A stochastic prediction model for the sunspot cycle is proposed. The prediction model is based on a modified binary mixture of Laplace distribution functions and a moving-average model over the estimated model parameters. A six-parameter modified binary mixture of Laplace distribution functions is used for the modeling of the shape of a generic sunspot cycle. The model parameters are estimated for 23 sunspot cycles independently, and the primary prediction-model parameters are derived from these estimated model parameters using a moving-average stochastic model. A correction factor (hump factor) is introduced to make an initial prediction. The hump factor is computed for a given sunspot cycle as the ratio of the model estimated after the completion of a sunspot cycle ( post-facto model) and the prediction of the moving-average model. The hump factors can be applied one at a time over the moving-average prediction model to get a final prediction of a sunspot cycle. The present model is used to predict the characteristics of Sunspot Cycle 24. The methodology is validated using the previous Sunspot Cycles 21, 22, and 23, which shows the adequacy and the applicability of the prediction model. The statistics of the variations of sunspot numbers at high solar activity are used to provide the lower and upper bound for the predictions using the present model.",

         "abstract": "Following our predictions on detectability, very weak lines of the SH molecules have been reported as identified in the photospheric spectrum of the Sun. This could be the first detection of a mercapto radical in the solar spectrum, thus placing confidence in the solar abundance of sulfur. The observation additionally tested the theoretical band oscillator strength that was used. Because sunspots are cooler than the photosphere, they host a large number of molecular species. However, owing to photospheric radiation scattered into the observed umbra, no lines of SH were detected in the sunspot spectrum, where they are expected to show equivalent widths larger than those in the photosphere. Detection of weak lines in the photosphere coupled with a non-detection of the relatively strong same lines in the sunspot spectrum might raise doubts about the detection itself. We investigated the choice of photospheric and sunspot models and the microturbulence values that indicate that the predicted sunspot lines are about half as intense as reported before, and the lines remain detectable.",

In recent years an abundance of high-resolution observations from state-of-the-art facilities have provided new and exciting ways of disentangling the characteristics of oscillatory phenomena propagating through the dynamic chromosphere. Coupled with rapid advancements in magnetohydrodynamic wave theory, we are now in an ideal position to thoroughly investigate the role waves play in supplying energy to sustain chromospheric and coronal heating. Here, we review the recent progress made in characterising, categorising and interpreting oscillations manifesting in the solar chromosphere, with an impetus placed on their intrinsic energetics.",

         "abstract": "This paper reviews past research and new studies underway of the local interstellar environment and its changing influence on the heliosphere. The size, shape, and physical properties of the heliosphere outside of the heliopause are determined by the surrounding environment - now the outer region of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC). The temperature, turbulence, and velocity vector of neutral atoms and ions in the LIC and other partially ionized interstellar clouds are measured from high-resolution spectra of interstellar absorption lines observed with the STIS instrument on the HST. Analysis of such spectra led to a kinematic model with many interstellar clouds defined by velocity vectors derived from radial velocity measurements. This analysis identified fifteen clouds located within about 10 pc of the Sun and their mean temperatures, turbulence, and velocity vectors. With the increasing number of sight lines now being analyzed, we find that temperatures and turbulent velocities have spatial variations within the LIC and other nearby clouds much larger than measurement uncertainties, and that these spatial variations appear to be randomly distributed and can be fit by Gaussians. The inhomogeneous length scale is less than 4,000 AU, a distance that the heliosphere will traverse in less than 600 years. The temperatures and turbulent velocities do not show significant trends with stellar distance or angle from the LIC center. If/when the Sun enters an inter-cloud medium, the physical properties of the future heliosphere will be very different from the present. For the heliosheath and the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) just outside of the heliopause, the total pressures are approximately equal to the gravitational pressure of overlying material in the Galaxy. The internal pressure in the LIC is far below that in the VLISM, but there is an uncertain ram pressure term produced by the flow of the LIC with respect to its environment.",

         "abstract": "In July 2016, NASA's Juno mission becomes the first spacecraft to enter polar orbit of Jupiter and venture deep into unexplored polar territories of the magnetosphere. Focusing on these polar regions, we review current understanding of the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere and summarize the outstanding issues. The Juno mission profile involves (a) a several-week approach from the dawn side of Jupiter's magnetosphere, with an orbit-insertion maneuver on July 6, 2016; (b) a 107-day capture orbit, also on the dawn flank; and (c) a series of thirty 11-day science orbits with the spacecraft flying over Jupiter's poles and ducking under the radiation belts. We show how Juno's view of the magnetosphere evolves over the year of science orbits. The Juno spacecraft carries a range of instruments that take particles and fields measurements, remote sensing observations of auroral emissions at UV, visible, IR and radio wavelengths, and detect microwave emission from Jupiter's radiation belts. We summarize how these Juno measurements address issues of auroral processes, microphysical plasma physics, ionosphere-magnetosphere and satellite-magnetosphere coupling, sources and sinks of plasma, the radiation belts, and the dynamics of the outer magnetosphere. To reach Jupiter, the Juno spacecraft passed close to the Earth on October 9, 2013, gaining the necessary energy to get to Jupiter. The Earth flyby provided an opportunity to test Juno's instrumentation as well as take scientific data in the terrestrial magnetosphere, in conjunction with ground-based and Earth-orbiting assets.",

         "abstract": "Almost 40 years ago the concept of the substorm current wedge was developed to explain the magnetic signatures observed on the ground and in geosynchronous orbit during substorm expansion. In the ensuing decades new observations, including radar and low-altitude spacecraft, MHD simulations, and theoretical considerations have tremendously advanced our understanding of this system. The AMPTE/IRM, THEMIS and Cluster missions have added considerable observational knowledge, especially on the important role of fast flows in producing the stresses that generate the substorm current wedge. Recent detailed, multi-spacecraft, multi-instrument observations both in the magnetosphere and in the ionosphere have brought a wealth of new information about the details of the temporal evolution and structure of the current system. While the large-scale picture remains valid, the new details call for revision and an update of the original view. In this paper we briefly review the historical development of the substorm current wedge, review recent in situ and ground-based observations and theoretical work, and discuss the current active research areas. We conclude with a revised, time-dependent picture of the substorm current wedge that follows its evolution from the initial substorm flows through substorm expansion and recovery.",

         "abstract": "This paper summarizes the results obtained by the team \"Heliosheath Processes and the Structure of the Heliopause: Modeling Energetic Particles, Cosmic Rays, and Magnetic Fields\" supported by the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern, Switzerland. We focus on the physical processes occurring in the outer heliosphere, especially at its boundary called the heliopause, and in the local interstellar medium. The importance of magnetic field, charge exchange between neutral atoms and ions, and solar cycle on the heliopause topology and observed heliocentric distances to different heliospheric discontinuities are discussed. It is shown that time-dependent, data-driven boundary conditions are necessary to describe the heliospheric asymmetries detected by the Voyager spacecraft. We also discuss the structure of the heliopause, especially due to its instability and magnetic reconnection. It is demonstrated that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the nose of the heliopause creates consecutive layers of the interstellar and heliospheric plasma which are magnetically connected to different sources. This may be a possible explanation of abrupt changes in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by Voyager 1 when it was crossing the heliopause structure for a period of about one month in the summer of 2012. This paper also discusses the plausibility of fitting simulation results to a number of observational data sets obtained by in situ and remote measurements. The distribution of magnetic field in the vicinity of the heliopause is discussed in the context of Voyager measurements. It is argued that a classical heliospheric current sheet formed due to the Sun's rotation is not observed by in situ measurements and should not be expected to exist in numerical simulations extending to the boundary of the heliosphere. Furthermore, we discuss the transport of energetic particles in the inner and outer heliosheath, concentrating on the anisotropic spatial diffusion diffusion tensor and the pitch-angle dependence of perpendicular diffusion and demonstrate that the latter can explain the observed pitch-angle anisotropies of both the anomalous and galactic cosmic rays in the outer heliosheath.",

         "abstract": "Magnetic turbulence is found in most space plasmas, including the Earth's magnetosphere, and the interaction region between the magnetosphere and the solar wind. Recent spacecraft observations of magnetic turbulence in the ion foreshock, in the magnetosheath, in the polar cusp regions, in the magnetotail, and in the high latitude ionosphere are reviewed. It is found that: 1. A large share of magnetic turbulence in the geospace environment is generated locally, as due for instance to the reflected ion beams in the ion foreshock, to temperature anisotropy in the magnetosheath and the polar cusp regions, to velocity shear in the magnetosheath and magnetotail, and to magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail. 2. Spectral indices close to the Kolmogorov value can be recovered for low frequency turbulence when long enough intervals at relatively constant flow speed are analyzed in the magnetotail, or when fluctuations in the magnetosheath are considered far downstream from the bow shock. 3. For high frequency turbulence, a spectral index \u03b1\u22432.3 or larger is observed in most geospace regions, in agreement with what is observed in the solar wind. 4. More studies are needed to gain an understanding of turbulence dissipation in the geospace environment, also keeping in mind that the strong temperature anisotropies which are observed show that wave particle interactions can be a source of wave emission rather than of turbulence dissipation. 5. Several spacecraft observations show the existence of vortices in the magnetosheath, on the magnetopause, in the magnetotail, and in the ionosphere, so that they may have a primary role in the turbulent injection and evolution. The influence of such a turbulence on the plasma transport, dynamics, and energization will be described, also using the results of numerical simulations.",

         "abstract": "Determining how the heliospheric magnetic field and plasma connect to the Sun's corona and photosphere is, perhaps, the central problem in solar and heliospheric physics. For much of the heliosphere, this connection appears to be well understood. It is now generally accepted that so-called coronal holes, which appear dark in X-rays and are predominantly unipolar at the photosphere, are the sources of quasi-steady wind that is generally fast, &gt;500 km/s, but can sometimes be slow. However, the connection to the Sun of the slow, non-steady wind is far from understood and remains a major mystery. We review the existing theories for the sources of the non-steady wind and demonstrate that they have difficulty accounting for both the observed composition of the wind and its large angular extent. A new theory is described in which this wind originates from the continuous opening and closing of narrow open field corridors in the corona, which give rise to a web of separatrices (the S-Web) in the heliosphere. Note that in this theory the corona\u2014heliosphere connection is intrinsically dynamic, at least for this type of wind. Support for the S-Web model is derived from MHD solutions for the corona and wind during the time of the August 1, 2008 eclipse. Additionally, we perform fully dynamic numerical simulations of the corona and heliosphere in order to test the S-Web model as well as the interchange model proposed by Fisk and co-workers. We discuss the implications of our simulations for the competing theories and for understanding the corona\u2014heliosphere connection, in general.",

Observations from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) over the three years 2010 to 2012 are employed to illustrate the variability of the field-aligned currents that couple the magnetosphere and ionosphere, on timescales from minutes to years, in response to the impact of solar wind disturbances on the magnetosphere and changes in the level of solar illumination of the polar ionospheres. The variability is discussed within the context of the occurrence of magnetic reconnection between the solar wind and terrestrial magnetic fields at the magnetopause, the transport of magnetic flux within the magnetosphere, and the onset of magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail. The conditions under which the currents are expected to be weak, and hence minimally contaminate measurements of the internally-produced magnetic field of the Earth, are briefly outlined.",

         "abstract": "The Solar Orbiter mission, to be launched in July 2017, will carry a suite of remote sensing and in-situ instruments, including the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI). PHI will deliver high-cadence images of the Sun in intensity and Doppler velocity suitable for carrying out novel helioseismic studies. The orbit of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft will reach a solar latitude of up to 21<SUP>\u2218</SUP> (up to 34<SUP>\u2218</SUP> by the end of the extended mission) and thus will enable the first local helioseismology studies of the polar regions. Here we consider an array of science objectives to be addressed by helioseismology within the baseline telemetry allocation (51 Gbit per orbit, current baseline) and within the science observing windows (baseline 3\u00d710 days per orbit). A particularly important objective is the measurement of large-scale flows at high latitudes (rotation and meridional flow), which are largely unknown but play an important role in flux transport dynamos. For both helioseismology and feature tracking methods convection is a source of noise in the measurement of longitudinally averaged large-scale flows, which decreases as T <SUP>-1/2</SUP> where T is the total duration of the observations. Therefore, the detection of small amplitude signals (e.g., meridional circulation, flows in the deep solar interior) requires long observation times. As an example, one hundred days of observations at lower spatial resolution would provide a noise level of about three m/s on the meridional flow at 80<SUP>\u2218</SUP> latitude. Longer time-series are also needed to study temporal variations with the solar cycle. The full range of Earth-Sun-spacecraft angles provided by the orbit will enable helioseismology from two vantage points by combining PHI with another instrument: stereoscopic helioseismology will allow the study of the deep solar interior and a better understanding of the physics of solar oscillations in both quiet Sun and sunspots. We have used a model of the PHI instrument to study its performance for helioseismology applications. As input we used a 6 hr time-series of realistic solar magneto-convection simulation (Stagger code) and the SPINOR radiative transfer code to synthesize the observables. The simulated power spectra of solar oscillations show that the instrument is suitable for helioseismology. In particular, the specified point spread function, image jitter, and photon noise are no obstacle to a successful mission.",

         "abstract": "This article reviews our knowledge of long-term changes and trends in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. These changes are part of complex and comprehensive pattern of long-term trends in the Earth's atmosphere. They also have practical impact. For example, decreasing thermospheric density causes the lifetime of orbiting space debris to increase, which is becoming a significant threat to important satellite technologies. Since the first paper on upper atmosphere trends was published in 1989, our knowledge has progressed considerably. Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases affect the whole atmosphere, not only the troposphere. They cause warming in the troposphere but cooling in the upper atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are not the only driver of long-term changes and trends in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. Anthropogenic changes of stratospheric ozone, long-term changes of geomagnetic and solar activity, and other drivers play a role as well, although greenhouse gases appear to be the main driver of long-term trends. This makes the pattern of trends more complex and variable. A consistent, although incomplete, scenario of trends in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere is presented. Trends in F2-region ionosphere parameters, in mesosphere-lower thermosphere dynamics, and in noctilucent or polar mesospheric clouds, are discussed in more detail. Advances in observational and theoretical analysis have explained some previous discrepancies in this global trend scenario. An important role in trend investigations is played by model simulations, which facilitate understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed trends.",

         "abstract": "The objective of this review article is to critically analyze turbulence and its role in the solar atmosphere and solar wind, as well as to provide a tutorial overview of topics worth clarification. Although turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the sun and its heliosphere, many open questions exist concerning the physical mechanisms of turbulence generation in solar environment. Also, the spatial and temporal evolution of the turbulence in the solar atmosphere and solar wind are still poorly understood. We limit the scope of this paper (leaving out the solar interior and convection zone) to the magnetized plasma that reaches from the photosphere and chromosphere upwards to the corona and inner heliosphere, and place particular emphasis on the magnetic field structures and fluctuations and their role in the dynamics and radiation of the coronal plasma. To attract the attention of scientists from both the fluid-dynamics and space-science communities we give in the first two sections a phenomenological overview of turbulence-related processes, in the context of solar and heliospheric physics and with emphasis on the photosphere-corona connection and the coupling between the solar corona and solar wind. We also discuss the basic tools and standard concepts for the empirical analysis and theoretical description of turbulence. The last two sections of this paper give a concise review of selected aspects of oscillations and waves in the solar atmosphere and related fluctuations in the solar wind. We conclude with some recommendations and suggest topics for future research.",

         "abstract": "More than half a century after the discovery of Pi2 pulsations, Pi2 research is still vigorous and evolving. Especially in the last decade, new results have provided supporting evidence for some Pi2 models, challenged earlier interpretations, and led to entirely new models. We have gone beyond the inner magnetosphere and have explored the outer magnetosphere, where Pi2 pulsations have been observed in unexpected places. The new Pi2 models cover virtually all magnetotail regions and their coupling, from the reconnection site via the lobes and plasma sheet to the ionosphere. In addition to understanding the Pi2 phenomenon in itself, it has also been important to study Pi2 pulsations in their role as transient manifestations of the coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The transient Pi2 is an integral part of the substorm phenomenon, especially during substorm onset. Key questions about the workings of magnetospheric substorms are still awaiting answers, and research on Pi2 pulsations can help with those answers. Furthermore, the role of Pi2 pulsations in association with other dynamic magnetospheric modes has been explored in the last decade. Thus, the application of Pi2 research has expanded over the years, assuring that Pi2 research will remain active in this decade and beyond. Here we review recent advances, which have given us a new understanding of Pi2 pulsations generated at various places in the magnetosphere during different magnetospheric modes. We review seven Pi2 models found in the literature and show how they are supported by observations from spacecraft and ground observatories as well as numerical simulations. The models have different degrees of maturity; while some enjoy wide acceptance, others are still speculative.",

         "abstract": "Solar thermal tides are planetary-scale waves in the neutral atmosphere with periods that are harmonics of 24 hours. In the thermosphere, they can achieve significant amplitude and can be the dominant source of variation in the atmosphere. Through their modification of the neutral atmosphere, they can also significantly modify the ionosphere, especially at low-latitudes where the dynamics of the Earth's ionosphere is determined to a large extent by the neutral atmosphere. Much recent work has focused on characterizing and understanding the impact of one sub-group of tides, known as non-migrating tides, on the ionosphere. Whereas migrating tides are responsible for creating strong day-night variations in the ionosphere, non-migrating tides create longitudinal variations in the ionosphere, the signature of which can only be detected with distributed networks of ground-based observations or spacecraft. The present work reviews the recent observations and modeling efforts that have helped to characterize and explain this longitudinal variability. Emphasis is placed on the characteristics of tides throughout the thermosphere, their impacts on the chemical composition of the thermosphere, and impacts on the ionosphere.",

         "abstract": "The solar wind environment has a large influence on the transport of cosmic rays. This chapter discusses the observations of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field in the outer heliosphere and the heliosheath. In the supersonic solar wind, interaction regions with large magnetic fields form barriers to cosmic ray transport. This effect, the \"CR-B\" relationship, has been quantified and is shown to be valid everywhere inside the termination shock (TS). In the heliosheath, this relationship breaks down, perhaps because of a change in the nature of the turbulence. Turbulence is compressive in the heliosheath, whereas it was non-compressive in the solar wind. The plasma pressure in the outer heliosphere is dominated by the pickup ions which gain most of the flow energy at the TS. The heliosheath plasma and magnetic field are highly variable on scales as small as ten minutes. The plasma flow turns away from the nose roughly as predicted, but the radial speeds at Voyager 1 are much less than those at Voyager 2, which is not understood. Despite predictions to the contrary, magnetic reconnection is not an important process in the inner heliosheath with only one observed occurrence to date.",

         "abstract": "Magnetic fields extend from the solar interior through the atmosphere. The formation and evolution of active regions can be studied by measuring subsurface flows with local helioseismology. The emergence of magnetic flux from the solar convection zone is associated with acoustic perturbation signatures. In near-surface layers, the average dynamics can be determined for emerging regions. MHD simulations of the emergence of a twisted flux tube show how magnetic twist and free energy are transported from the interior into the corona and the dynamic signatures associated with such transport in the photospheric and sub-photospheric layers. The subsurface twisted flux tube does not emerge into the corona as a whole in emerging active regions. Shear flows at the polarity inversion line and coherent vortical motions in the subsurface flux tubes are the major means by which twist is transported into the corona, leading to the formation of sigmoid-shaped coronal magnetic fields capable of driving solar eruptions. The transport of twist can be followed from the interior by using the kinetic helicity of subsurface flows as a proxy of magnetic helicity; this quantity holds great promise for improving the understanding of eruptive phenomena. Waves are not only vital for studying the link between the solar interior and the surface but for linking the photosphere with the corona as well. Acoustic waves that propagate from the surface into the magnetically structured, dynamic atmosphere undergo mode conversion and refraction. These effects enable atmospheric seismology to determine the topography of magnetic canopies in the solar atmosphere. Inclined magnetic fields lower the cut-off frequency so that low frequency waves can leak into the outer atmosphere. Recent high resolution, high cadence observations of waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere, have lead to a renewed interest in the potential role of waves as a heating mechanism. In light of their potential contribution to the heating of the solar atmosphere, some of the recent observations of waves and oscillations and ongoing modelling efforts are reviewed.",

We briefly review the cyclic variability of such heliospheric parameters as solar wind speed and density and heliospheric magnetic field, open magnetic flux and latitude variations of the heliospheric current sheet. It is discussed whether the local in-situ observation near Earth can represent the global 3D heliospheric pattern. Variability of cosmic rays near Earth provides an indirect useful tool to study the heliosphere. We discuss details of the heliospheric modulation of galactic cosmic rays, as recorded at and near Earth, and their relation to the heliospheric conditions in the outer heliosphere. On the other hand, solar energetic particles can serve as probes for explosive phenomena on the Sun and conditions in the corona and inner heliosphere. The occurrence of major solar proton events depicts an overall tendency to follow the solar cycle but individual events may appear at different phases of the solar cycle, as defined by various factors. The solar cycle in the heliosphere and cosmic rays depicts a complex pattern which includes different processes and cannot be described by a simple correlation with sunspot number.",

         "abstract": "Auroral substorms are mostly manifestations of dissipative processes of electromagnetic energy. Thus, we consider a sequence of processes consisting of the power supply (dynamo), transmission (currents/circuits) and dissipations (auroral substorms-the end product), namely the electric current line approach. This work confirms quantitatively that after accumulating magnetic energy during the growth phase, the magnetosphere unloads the stored magnetic energy impulsively in order to stabilize itself. This work is based on our result that substorms are caused by two current systems, the directly driven (DD) current system and the unloading system (UL). The most crucial finding in this work is the identification of the UL (unloading) current system which is responsible for the expansion phase. A very tentative sequence of the processes leading to the expansion phase (the generation of the UL current system) is suggested for future discussions. <P />(1) The solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo enhances significantly the plasma sheet current when its power is increased above 10^{18} erg/s (10^{11} w). <P />(2) The magnetosphere accumulates magnetic energy during the growth phase, because the ionosphere cannot dissipate the increasing power because of a low conductivity. As a result, the magnetosphere is inflated, accumulating magnetic energy. <P />(3) When the power reaches 3-5\u00d7 10^{18} erg/s (3-5\u00d7 10^{11} w) for about one hour and the stored magnetic energy reaches 3-5\u00d710^{22} ergs (10^{15} J), the magnetosphere begins to develop perturbations caused by current instabilities (the current density {\u2248}3\u00d7 10^{-12} A/cm<SUP>2</SUP> and the total current {\u2248}10<SUP>6</SUP> A at 6 Re). As a result, the plasma sheet current is reduced. <P />(4) The magnetosphere is thus deflated. The current reduction causes partial B/partial t &gt; 0 in the main body of the magnetosphere, producing an earthward electric field. As it is transmitted to the ionosphere, it becomes equatorward-directed electric field which drives both Pedersen and Hall currents and thus generates the UL current system. <P />(5) A significant part of the magnetic energy is accumulated in the main body of the magnetosphere (the inner plasma sheet) between 4 Re and 10 Re, because the power (Poynting flux [ E \u00d7 B ]) is mainly directed toward this region which can hold the substorm energy. <P />(6) The substorm intensity depends on the location of the energy accumulation (between 4 Re and 10 Re), the closer the location to the earth, the more intense substorms becomes, because the capacity of holding the energy is higher at closer distances. The convective flow toward the earth brings both the ring current and the plasma sheet current closer when the dynamo power becomes higher. <P />This proposed sequence is not necessarily new. Individual processes involved have been considered by many, but the electric current approach can bring them together systematically and provide some new quantitative insights.",

         "abstract": "We review recent advances in the field of galactic cosmic ray transport in the distant heliosphere. The advent of global MHD models brought about a better understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the interface between the solar system and the surrounding interstellar space, and of the magnetic field topology in the outer heliosphere. These results stimulated a development of galactic cosmic ray transport models taking the advantage of the available detailed plasma backgrounds and of the new Voyager results from the heliosheath. It emerges that the heliosheath plays a prominent role in the process of modulation and filtration of low-energy galactic ions and electrons. The heliosheath stores particles for a duration of several years thus acting as a large reservoir of galactic cosmic rays. Cosmic-ray trajectories, transit times, and entry locations across the heliopause are discussed. When compared to observations model calculations of low energy electrons show almost no radial gradient up to the termination shock, irrespective of solar activity, but a large gradient in the inner heliosheath. Intensities are however sensitive to heliospheric conditions such as the location of the heliopause and shock. In contrast, high energy proton observations by both the Voyager spacecraft show a clear solar cycle dependence with intensities also increasing with increasing distance. By comparing these observations to model calculations we can establish whether our current understanding of long-term modulation result in computed intensities compatible to observations.",

We discuss electromagnetic wave generation, propagation, and resonance phenomena, considering atmospheric, ionospheric and magnetospheric sources, from lightning and transient luminous events at low altitude to Alfv\u00e9n waves and particle precipitation related to solar and magnetospheric processes. We review ionospheric processes as well as surface and space weather phenomena that drive the coupling between the troposphere and the ionosphere. Effects of aerosols, water vapor distribution, thermodynamic parameters, and cloud charge separation and electrification processes on atmospheric electricity and electromagnetic waves are reviewed. Regarding the role of the lower boundary of the cavity, we review transient surface phenomena, including seismic activity, earthquakes, volcanic processes and dust electrification. The role of surface perturbations and atmospheric gravity waves in ionospheric dynamics is also briefly addressed. We summarize analytical and numerical tools and techniques to model low frequency electromagnetic wave propagation and to solve inverse problems and outline in a final section a few challenging subjects that are important to advance our understanding of tropospheric-ionospheric coupling.",

In particular, we consider the resonant structures in the spectra of the magnetic background noise related to the Alfv\u00e9n resonances in the ionosphere as a possible diagnostic tool for studies of the ionospheric parameters. We also discuss the self-excitation of Alfv\u00e9n waves in the ionosphere due to the AIM coupling and the role of such waves in the acceleration of electrons in the upper ionosphere and magnetosphere.

         "abstract": "Classical Orbit Determination algorithms provide an estimation of the state vector and its associated uncertainty assuming Gaussian processes and linear dynamics. However, a common problem of Orbit Determination processes is the misrepresentation of the Resident Space Object uncertainty through the estimated and predicted covariance. Ultimately, this causes a great impact in the quality and accuracy of Space Surveillance and Tracking products as the covariance is overly optimistic (too small) and the true uncertainty of the object is not properly captured. One of the causes for the unrealism of the covariance is found in the uncertainty of the dynamical and measurement models used to describe the motion of the objects. <P />The aim of this work is to devise a novel methodology to improve the covariance realism of Orbit Determination and Orbit Propagation processes through the classical theory of consider parameters in batch least-squares estimators. The devised methodology uses the theory of consider parameters to add the uncertainty of dynamic and measurement models to the estimated covariance. <P />The magnitude of the consider parameters is weighted using statistical inference techniques, proposing an innovative method to derive its contribution to the covariance. The conceived methodology is suitable for any type of measurement or object, although its primary goal is to correct unrealistic covariance of non-cooperative targets. <P />Among the wide variety of uncertainty sources affecting covariance realism, the influence and effect of two relevant modelling uncertainties, the atmospheric drag force and the range bias, is discussed during this publication. The proposed methodology is first applied to a simulated scenario of tracking measurements, using a Monte Carlo approach. A case involving real radar observations is presented as well, where the uncertainty realism of the Sentinel-3A orbit determination and propagation is assessed and improved. Using the novel methodology of Covariance Determination, covariance realism improvement of a real tracking campaign is achieved and the uncertainty of the atmospheric drag force model quantified.",

In this paper, we present efficiency of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in ionosphere time series prediction at severe solar activity periods. The high accuracy prediction of the ionosphere total electron content (TEC) using ANFIS is the main purpose of the paper. Also, investigation of the daily, monthly and annually temporal behavior of the ionosphere is another goal of the paper. Three GPS stations (ANKR, ANTL and ZONG) from Turkish permanent GPS network (TPGN) are selected for analysis. These stations are at mid-latitudes. To predict and analyze ionospheric temporal behavior, observations of the 2014-2015 are selected. The index of solar activity in these 2 years is the maximum. Training of ANFIS is done by back-propagation (BP) algorithm. In order to analyze the accuracy of the proposed method, testing step has been performed in different days, months and seasons and compared with the global ionosphere map (GIM) TEC as a traditional ionosphere model, as well as, international reference ionosphere 2016 (IRI2016) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. To validate the results, root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, relative error, dTEC = |TEC<SUB>GPS</SUB>-TEC<SUB>MODEL</SUB>| and residual histogram are used. At testing step, the maximum correlation coefficient obtained 0.869 for the ANFIS. Also, the minimum RMSE of 3.131 TECU is computed for ANFIS at testing step. Using the ANFIS model, the daily, monthly and annual variations of the ionosphere time series are revealed with high accuracy. The results show that the ANFIS model is a reliable and high-precision alternative to the conventional ionosphere models in Turkish region.",

The tile and SIP are both simplified as the combination of a mass point, a linear spring and a damping element, and all the dynamic parameters obey the normal distribution. The probability distributions of responses were derived from adopting the perturbation method. The difference method is used to analyze the sensitivity of the mean responses to random parameters, and the reasonable sensitivity values are obtained under a difference step which is equal to the standard deviation of the random parameter. The probability distributions calculated by the uncertainty theoretical model match well with the Monte Carlo numerical results, so the accuracy of the uncertainty dynamic theoretical model is verified. The researches in this paper provide a theoretical foundation for studying the uncertainty dynamic behaviors of TPS, analyzing uncertainty dynamic strength of SIP and intensifying the integrity and security of TPS.",

         "abstract": "The radiation belts are a key region located close to the Earth, where the satellites travel. They are located in the centre of the magnetosphere and constitute a region sensitive to the variations of magnetosphere activity. The magnetosphere is in equilibrium in the solar wind. If the solar wind parameters change, then, the magnetospheric balance is upset. Using several processes, particles and energy from the solar wind can enter it, disturbing the magnetosphere and the radiation belts. In this paper, the am index has been used to define a new parameter named Cm, which is indicative of the energy level in the magnetosphere. The impact of CIRs (Corotating Interaction region) and of CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejection) on the magnetosphere has been studied from the Cm point of view, as well as the reaction of the radiation belts to a solar wind disturbance. The results show that the Cm parameter provides a new perspective in space weather studies as it clearly shows that the energy level can be higher for a CIR than for a CME. It also demonstrates that the events with several solar wind structures are much more effective to increase the energy level in the magnetosphere than single ones. Finally, Cm correlates better with the radiation belts fluxes, showing again that Cm is a good indicator of the inner magnetosphere activity. Nevertheless, the energy level in the radiation belts is maximised and the energy level in this population cannot go above a given value which depends on the altitude. The particles coming from the plasmasheet also push the particles from the highest altitudes to the lower ones, allowing the slot filling for Cm&gt; &lt;Cm&gt;.",

         "abstract": "A key objective of space situational awareness is to provide an accurate characterization of state uncertainty of space objects (SOs) in order to support predictive analytics, such as assessments of the probability of collision with other SOs. Due to a large number of SOs in comparison with the limited number of sensors available for tracking them, physics based uncertainty forecasting is often required for long periods, during which state uncertainty can become highly non-Gaussian. In this paper, we consider the problem of uncertainty forecasting in perturbed two-body dynamics via adaptive Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). While widely used, the standard Monte Carlo approach is limited by two main challenges: i.) its slow rate of convergence, which is especially detrimental to its application in complex systems where each simulation is computationally expensive; and ii.) ambiguity in the ensemble's capability to \"accurately\" characterize the true state-pdf over time with a fixed ensemble size, given the fact that the propagated state uncertainty is time-varying and unknown in advance. We employ a newly developed adaptive Monte Carlo method that aims to characterize the propagated state-pdf within user defined accuracy bounds in the perturbed two-body dynamics. In the adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm, the transient performance of MCS is quantified in terms of the standard deviation of its approximation error, which is estimated via bootstrapping. A particle addition scheme is activated when the approximation error exceeds the user-defined upper bound at the current time and new particles are introduced sequentially, one at a time. These are selected through a two-layered algorithm that (a.) enforces optimal inter-particle projective distance, and (b.) minimizes sample discrepancy with respect to the true initial state-pdf in terms of the space-filling and non-collapsing properties. On the other hand, particles are removed (halted) for future propagation when current MCS error is estimated to be lower than the user defined threshold, in the interest of reducing computational load. Particle removal is dependent on their own evolved probability-density values which are obtained by solving the corresponding stochastic Liouville equation (SLE) numerically. As a result, the proposed approach is expected to generate a \"minimal\" ensemble of particles to characterize the propagated state-pdf within user defined accuracy bounds at all future times. Numerical simulations are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting method.",

Analysis of the 89 validated ozone profiles shows the variation of ozone concentration in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) caused by cut-off lows (COLs) over Changchun. During the COL events, an increase of the ozone concentration and a lower height of the tropopause are observed. Backward simulations with a trajectory model show that the ozone-rich airmass brought by the COL is from Siberia. A case study proves that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) occurs in the COL. The ozone-rich air mass transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere first becomes unstable, then loses its high ozone concentration. This process usually happens during the decay stage of COLs. In order to understand the influence of COLs on the ozone in the UTLS, statistical analysis of the ozone profiles within COLs, and other profiles, are employed. The results indicate that the ozone concentrations of the in-COL profiles are significantly higher than those of the other profiles between \u00b14 km around the tropopause. The COLs induce an increase in UTLS column ozone by 32% on average. Meanwhile, the COLs depress the lapse-rate tropopause (LRT)/dynamical tropopause height by 1.4/1.7 km and cause the atmosphere above the tropopause to be less stable. The influence of COLs is durable because the increased ozone concentration lasts at least one day after the COL has passed over Changchun. Furthermore, the relative coefficient between LRT height and lower stratosphere (LS) column ozone is -0.62, which implies a positive correlation between COL strength and LS ozone concentration.",

         "abstract": "Tropopause folds are one of the key mechanisms of stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) in extratropical regions, transporting ozone-rich stratospheric air into the middle and lower troposphere. Although there have been many studies of tropopause folds that have occurred over Europe and North America, a very limited amount of work has been carried out over northeastern Asia. Ozonesondes produced by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics were launched in Changchun (43.9\u00b0N, 125.2\u00b0E), Northeast China, in June 2013, and observed an ozone-enriched layer with thickness of 3 km and an ozone peak of 180 ppbv at 6 km in the troposphere. The circulation field from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) dataset shows that this ozone peak was caused by a tropopause fold associated with a jet stream at the eastern flank of the East Asian trough. By analyzing the ozone data from the ozone monitoring instrument and Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations, it was found that a high ozone concentration tongue originating from the lower stratosphere at high latitude (near central Siberia) intruded into the middle troposphere over Changchun between 5 and 8 km on 12 June 2013. The high-resolution WRF-Chem simulation was capable of describing events such as the tropopause fold that occurred on the cyclonic shear side of the jet stream. In addition, the TRAJ3D trajectory model was used to trace the origin of measured secondary ozone peaks in the middle troposphere back, for example, to stratospheric intrusion through the tropopause fold.",

         "abstract": "This paper examines the dominant submonthly variability of zonally symmetrical atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter within the context of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), with particular emphasis on interactive stratosphere-troposphere processes. The submonthly variability is identified and measured using a daily NAM index, which concentrates primarily on zonally symmetrical circulation. A schematic lifecycle of submonthly variability is developed that reveals a two-way coupling process between the stratosphere and troposphere in the NH polar region. Specifically, anomalous tropospheric zonal winds in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors of the Arctic propagate upwards to the low stratosphere, disturbing the polar vortex, and resulting in an anomalous stratospheric geopotential height (HGT) that subsequently propagates down into the troposphere and changes the sign of the surface circulations. From the standpoint of planetary-scale wave activities, a feedback loop is also evident when the anomalous planetary-scale waves (with wavenumbers 2 and 3) propagate upwards, which disturbs the anomalous zonally symmetrical flow in the low stratosphere, and induces the anomalous HGT to move poleward in the low stratosphere, and then propagates down into the troposphere. This increases the energy of waves at wavenumbers 2 and 3 in the low troposphere in middle latitudes by enhancing the land-sea contrast of the anomalous HGT field. Thus, this study supports the viewpoint that the downward propagation of stratospheric NAM signals may not originate in the stratosphere.",

S-type AO events showed a stratosphere-troposphere coupled structure, while T-type events exhibited a stratosphere-troposphere uncoupled structure. The annular SAT anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere were found to be associated with S-type AO events, whereas such an annular feature was substantially destructed in T-type AO events. The different horizontal structures in the troposphere of the two types could mainly be attributed to transient eddy feedback forcing. As for the vertically uncoupled structure of Ttype events, the underlying dynamical features that differentiate them from S-type events lie in the vertical propagation of zonally confined Rossby waves. In T-type events, the zonally confined Rossby wave packets can emanate from the significant height anomalies over Northeast Asia, where one vertical waveguide exists, and then propagate upward into the stratosphere. In contrast, such a vertical propagation was not evident for S-type events. The stratospheric anomalies associated with the upward injection of the zonally confined Rossby waves from the troposphere in T-type events can further induce the anomalous vertical propagation of planetary waves (PWs) through the interference between the climatological-mean PWs and anomalous PWs, leading to the final stratosphere-troposphere uncoupled structure of T-type events.",

Then, a sensitivity experiment, with the methane volume mixing ratio increased by 10%, was carried out to study the influence of an increase of methane on air temperature. The results showed that methane has a heating effect through the infrared radiative process in the troposphere and a cooling effect in the stratosphere. However, the cooling effect of the methane is much smaller than that of water vapor in the stratosphere and is negligible in the mesosphere. The simulation results also showed that when methane concentration is increased by 10%, the air temperature lowers in the stratosphere and mesosphere and increases in the troposphere. The cooling can reach 0.2 K at the stratopause and can vary from 0.2-0.4 K in the mesosphere, and the temperature rise varies by around 0.001-0.002 K in the troposphere. The cooling results from the increase of the infrared radiative cooling rate caused by increased water vapor and O<SUB>3</SUB> concentration, which are stimulated by the increase in methane in most of the stratosphere. The infrared radiation cooling of methane itself is minor. The depletion of O<SUB>3</SUB> stimulated by the methane increase results indirectly in a decrease in the rate of solar radiation heating, producing cooling in the stratopause and mesosphere. The tropospheric warming is mainly caused by the increase of methane, which produces infrared radiative heating.

The results indicate that increases in stratospheric water vapor lead to stratospheric cooling, with the extent of cooling increasing with height, and that cooling in the middle stratosphere is stronger in Arctic regions. Analysis of the radiation process showed that infrared radiative cooling by water vapor is a pivotal factor in middle-lower stratospheric cooling. However, in the upper stratosphere (above 45 km), infrared radiation is not a factor in cooling; there, cooling is caused by the decreased solar radiative heating rate resulting from ozone decrease due to increased stratospheric water vapor. Dynamical cooling is important in the middle-upper stratosphere, and dynamical feedback to temperature change is more distinct in the Northern Hemisphere middle-high latitudes than in other regions and significantly affects temperature and ozone in winter over Arctic regions. Increasing stratospheric water vapor will strengthen ozone depletion through the chemical process. However, ozone will increase in the middle stratosphere. The change in ozone due to increasing water vapor has an important effect on the stratospheric temperature change.",

The results indicate that the distribution of residence time ( t <SUB>TST</SUB>) of tropopause-crossing trajectories in the lowermost stratosphere represents a horizontal signature of the Asian summer monsoon. Vertically, the distribution of t <SUB>TST</SUB> can be roughly separated into two layers: a consistent lower layer with t <SUB>TST</SUB> &lt;5 days forming a narrow band, corresponding to a layer \u223c3 km thick following the location of the tropopause, and an upper layer at a larger distance from the local tropopause. The maximum residence time was \u223c20 days, especially within the Asian high anticyclone consistent with its confinement effects. In general, the overall geographical distribution of dehydration points was not coincident with the location of tropopause crossing. TST trajectories, which were initialized in the stratosphere, underwent their Lagrangian cold points mostly in the tropics and subtropics 1-4 days after the TST event; they were characterized by a wide range of temperature differences, with a mean value of 3-12 K. The vertical extent of the influence of tropospheric intrusion on the Asian monsoon region in the stratosphere exhibited a peak at \u223c16.5-18.5 km, and the uppermost height was \u223c21 km.",

         "abstract": "In the last few years, there has been growing interest in near-real-time solar data processing, especially for space weather applications. This is due to space weather impacts on both space-borne and ground-based systems, and industries, which subsequently impacts our lives. In the current study, the deep learning approach is used to establish an automated hybrid computer system for a short-term forecast; it is achieved by using the complexity level of the sunspot group on SDO/HMI Intensitygram images. Furthermore, this suggested system can generate the forecast for solar flare occurrences within the following 24 h. The input data for the proposed system are SDO/HMI full-disk Intensitygram images and SDO/HMI full-disk magnetogram images. System outputs are the \"Flare or Non-Flare\" of daily flare occurrences (C, M, and X classes). This system integrates an image processing system to automatically detect sunspot groups on SDO/HMI Intensitygram images using active-region data extracted from SDO/HMI magnetogram images (presented by Colak and Qahwaji, 2008) and deep learning to generate these forecasts. Our deep learning-based system is designed to analyze sunspot groups on the solar disk to predict whether this sunspot group is capable of releasing a significant flare or not. Our system introduced in this work is called ASAP_Deep. The deep learning model used in our system is based on the integration of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Softmax classifier to extract special features from the sunspot group images detected from SDO/HMI (Intensitygram and magnetogram) images. Furthermore, a CNN training scheme based on the integration of a back-propagation algorithm and a mini-batch AdaGrad optimization method is suggested for weight updates and to modify learning rates, respectively. The images of the sunspot regions are cropped automatically by the imaging system and processed using deep learning rules to provide near real-time predictions. The major results of this study are as follows. Firstly, the ASAP_Deep system builds on the ASAP system introduced in Colak and Qahwaji (2009) but improves the system with an updated deep learning-based prediction capability. Secondly, we successfully apply CNN to the sunspot group image without any pre-processing or feature extraction. Thirdly, our system results are considerably better, especially for the false alarm ratio (FAR); this reduces the losses resulting from the protection measures applied by companies. Also, the proposed system achieves a relatively high scores for True Skill Statistics (TSS) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS).",

         "abstract": "The heating of the chromosphere is a long-lived puzzle in modern astronomy. Solar synoptic maps of He I 10830 \u00c5 intensity, which are observed at National Solar Observatory/Kitt Peak from Jul. 2005 to Mar. 2013 are utilized to investigate the phase relation of long-term evolution of the quiet chromosphere represented by He I intensity with the solar cycle represented by sunspot number. The phase relationship of the He I chromosphere at low and middle latitudes with the solar cycle is found to show an interesting phenomenon, black under the light: (1) at most of the latitudes of the conspicuous active chromosphere (the butterfly diagram), the relationship is anti-phase, but at the latitudes outside the butterfly diagram (the inconspicuous background chromosphere), it is in-phase; and (2) the He I intensity averaged over the low latitudes of 0- 30 \u00b0 is in anti-phase with the solar cycle, but after deducing some relatively small values of He I intensity, the anti-phase relationship is reversed to be in-phase. Long-term variation of He I intensity at the full disk of the quiet chromosphere is believed to be in phase with the solar cycle, and accordingly, the temporal evolution of the heated quiet chromosphere is in phase with long-term variation of the small-scale magnetic elements whose flux is (2.9 - 32.0) \u00d710<SUP>18</SUP> Mx, and it provides evidence for the heating of the quiet chromosphere mainly by the magnetic elements. Implication of the findings is discussed, and especially, the long-term variation of total solar irradiance measured at low latitudes is inferred to be significantly different from that at high latitudes.",

         "abstract": "The high variability of the Sun's magnetic field is responsible for the generation of perturbations that propagate throughout the heliosphere. Such disturbances often drive interplanetary shocks in front of their leading regions. Strong shocks transfer momentum and energy into the solar wind ahead of them which in turn enhance the solar wind interaction with magnetic fields in its way. Shocks then eventually strike the Earth's magnetosphere and trigger a myriad of geomagnetic effects observed not only by spacecraft in space, but also by magnetometers on the ground. Recently, it has been revealed that shocks can show different geoeffectiveness depending closely on the angle of impact. Generally, frontal shocks are more geoeffective than inclined shocks, even if the former are comparatively weaker than the latter. This review is focused on results obtained from modeling and experimental efforts in the last 15 years. Some theoretical and observational background are also provided. <P />&lt;/ce:displayed-quote&gt;The possibility of the existence of shocks in the interplanetary space was then accepted. Parker (1961) suggested a model for shock propagation in the interplanetary space. His idea was further extended by Hundhausen and Gentry (1969). However, the first evidences of collisionless shocks in nature were observed in the interplanetary space. As seen above, the existence of the magnetosphere suggested the formation of a stationary collisionless shock at the front of the magnetosphere. Curiously, the existence of a stationary shock, i.e., a shock at rest in the Earth's reference frame, was suggested in the same edition of the Journal of Geophysical Research by Axford (1962) and Kellogg (1962). The bow shock was first observed by the Mariner 2 spacecraft as irreversible changes in the solar wind and IMF which were interpreted as hydromagnetic shocks (Ness et al., 1964; Sonett et al., 1964). The bow shock is formed if a supersonic flow interacts with an obstacle, and it separates the pristine solar wind from the subsonic plasma flow in the magnetosheath. Another magnetospheric boundary is the magnetopause, a current layer whose position is determined by the pressure balance condition between the solar wind dynamic pressure and the magnetospheric magnetic pressure, first observed by Heppner et al. (1963) and Cahill and Amazeen (1963). The region between the bow shock and the magnetopause is called the magnetosheath. The magnetosheath in the subsolar region for typical solar wind conditions is located approximately at a distance between 10R<SUB>E</SUB> and 13R<SUB>E</SUB> (Earth radius of \u223c 6400 km) from the Earth (Cahill and Amazeen, 1963; Heppner et al., 1963; Russell, 1984). This region is highly turbulent because it is formed by the shocked solar wind (Russell, 1984; Paschmann, 2005). The bow shock, magnetopause, and magnetosheath are shown in Fig. 2, as seen in Eastwood et al. (2014). The numerical gas dynamic model of Spreiter et al. (1966) reasonably well predicted the bow shock formation and magnetosheath flow between the bow shock and magnetopause obstacle. For a broader perspective on the discovery of the magnetosphere, see, e.g., Russell (1984) and Gillmor and Spreiter (1997).&lt;/ce:para&gt;",

We focus on the role of planetary and gravity waves in driving the middle atmosphere circulation and illustrate the stratosphere-mesosphere coupling during undisturbed wintertime circulation, during an SSW event, and after an SSW event during the formation of an elevated stratopause using simulations of past Arctic and Antarctic winters from the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). We illustrate the transition of the polar stratopause from being a gravity wave driven phenomena to a planetary wave driven phenomena during SSW events and its subsequent reestablishment and control by gravity waves. We also examine the synoptic structure of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere using SD-WACCM data fields that show the structure of the vortex during specific dynamical events in both hemispheres. We illustrate the longitudinal asymmetry in the thermal structure in the stratosphere and mesosphere driven by differences in circulation over the polar cap regions during an SSW event. We complement this analysis of the middle atmosphere circulation with a classification of both the Arctic and Antarctic winters since 1979 into major, minor, elevated stratopause or quiet winters based on the level of disturbance using the Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis data. From the MERRA data we find that the combined occurrences of both major and minor warmings in the Arctic have remained constant over the past three decades while we find a minor increase in their occurrences in the Antarctic.",

         "abstract": "Global Positioning System (GPS) is a remote sensing tool of space weather and ionospheric variations. However, the interplanetary space-dependent drifts in the ionospheric irregularities cause predominant ranging errors in the GPS signals. The dynamic variability of the low-latitude ionosphere is an imperative threat to the satellite-based radio communication and navigation ranging systems. The study of temporal and spatial variations in the ionosphere has triggered new investigations in modelling, nowcasting and forecasting the ionospheric variations. Hence, in this paper, the dynamism in the day-to-day, month-to-month and seasonal variability of the ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) has been explored during the solar maximum period, January-December 2013, of the 24th solar cycle. The spatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere are analysed using the TEC values derived from three Indian low-latitude GPS stations, namely, Bengaluru, Guntur and Hyderabad, separated by 13-18\u00b0 in latitude and 77-81\u00b0 in longitude. The observed regional GPS-TEC variations are compared with the predicted TEC values of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2012 and 2007) models. Ionospheric parameters such as Vertical TEC (VTEC), relative TEC deviation index and monthly variations in the grand-mean of ionosphere TEC and TEC intensity, along with the upper and lower quartiles, are adopted to investigate the ionosphere TEC variability during quiet and disturbed days. The maximum ionospheric TEC variability is found during March and September equinoxes, followed by December solstice while the minimum variability is observed during June solstice. IRI models are in reasonable agreement with GPS TEC but are overestimating during dawn hours (01:00-06:00 LT) as compared to the dusk hours. Higher percentage deviations are observed during equinoctial months than summer over EIA stations, Guntur and Hyderabad. GPS TEC variations are overestimated during dawn hours for all the seasons over Bengaluru. It has also been observed that positive storm effect (enhancement of TEC) is observed during the main phase of the March storm, 2013 (March 16-18, 2013) while both positive and negative storm effects (depletion of TEC) are registered during the main phase of the June storm, 2013 (June 28-30, 2013) at Bengaluru and Guntur, respectively. IRI-2012 model has slightly large discrepancies with the GPS-VTEC compared with the IRI-2007 model during the June storm, 2013 over Guntur station. This analysis highlights the importance of upgrading the IRI models due to their discrepancies during quiet and disturbed states of the ionosphere and developing an early warning forecast system to alert about ionosphere variability.",

         "abstract": "ADAHELI (ADvanced Astronomy for HELIophysics) is a small-class (500 kg) low-budget (50 MEuro) satellite mission for the study of the solar photosphere and the chromosphere and for monitoring solar flare emission. ADAHELI's design has completed its Phase-A feasibility study in December 2008, in the framework of ASI's (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) 2007 \"Small Missions\" Program (calling for two missions at 50 MEeuros each, plus the launch budget). ADAHELI's main purpose is to explore Sun's lower atmosphere in the near-infrared, a region so far unexplored by solar observations from space. ADAHELI will carry out observations of the solar photosphere and of the chromosphere at high-temporal rate and high spatial and spectral resolutions. ADAHELI will contribute to the understanding of Space Weather through the study of particle acceleration during flares. A radiometer operating in the millimeter radio band will continuously monitor the solar disk, throughout the spacecraft's life time. ADAHELI's baseline instruments are a 50-cm high-resolution telescope operating in the visible and the near-infrared, and a lightweight full-disk radiometer operating at millimeter wavelengths (90 GHz). The core of the telescope's focal plane suite is the spectral imager based on two Fabry-Perot interferometers, flying for the first time on a solar mission. The instrument will return fast-cadence, full bi-dimensional spectral images at high-resolution, thus improving on current slit-scan, mono-dimensional architectures. Moreover, the possibility of working in polarized light will enable full 3D magnetic field reconstruction on the photosphere and the chromosphere. An optional instrumental package is also being proposed to further extend ADAHELI's scope: a full-disk telescope for helioseismology based on a double Magneto-Optical Filter, a Neutral Particle Analyzer for magnetospheric research, an Extreme Ultraviolet imaging and spectro-radiometry instrument. These options fall outside the prescribed budget. ADAHELI, flying a Sun-Synchronous orbit at 800 km, will perform continuous, long-duration (4-h), daily acquisitions, with the possibility of extending them up to 24 h. ADAHELI's operating life is two years, plus one extension year. Launch would be nominally planned for 2014.",

         "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections are the primary cause of the highly disturbed conditions observed in the magnetosphere. Momentum and energy from the solar wind are transferred to the Earth's magnetosphere mainly via magnetic reconnection which produces open field lines connecting the Earth magnetic field to the solar wind. Magnetospheric currents are coupled to the ionosphere through field-aligned currents. This particular characteristic of the magnetosphere-ionosphere interconnection is discussed here on the basis of the energy transfer from high (auroral currents) to low-latitudes (ring current). The objective of this work is to examine how the conditions during a magnetic storm can affect the global space and time configuration of the ring current, and, how these processes can affect the region of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. The H- or X-components of the Earth's magnetic field were examined using a set of six magnetometers approximately aligned around the geographic longitude at about 10 \u00b0, 140 \u00b0 and 295 \u00b0 from latitudes of 70 \u00b0 N to 70 \u00b0 S and aligned throughout the equatorial region, for the event of October 18-22, 1998. The investigation of simultaneous observations of data measured at different locations makes it possible to determine the effects of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, and, it tries to establish some relationships among them. This work also compares the responses of the aligned magnetic observatories to the responses in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly region. The major contribution of this paper is related to the applied methodology of the discrete wavelet transform. The wavelet coefficients are used as a filter to extract the information in high frequencies of the analyzed magnetogram. They also better represent information about the injections of energy and, consequently, the disturbances of the geomagnetic field measured on the ground. As a result, we present a better way to visualize the correlation between the X- or H-components. In the latitude range from \u223c 40 \u00b0 S to \u223c 60 \u00b0 N, the wavelet signatures do not show remarkable differences, except for the amplitudes of the wavelet coefficients. The sequence of transient field variations detected at auroral latitudes is probably associated to occurrences of substorms, while at lower latitudes, these variations are associated to the enhancement of the ring current.",

         "abstract": "Observations made with the two Voyager spacecraft confirmed that the solar wind decelerates to form the heliospheric termination shock. Voyager 1 crossed this termination shock at \u223c94 AU in 2004, while Voyager 2 crossed it in 2007 at a different heliolatitude, about 10 AU closer to the Sun. These different positions of the termination shock confirm the dynamic and cyclic nature of the shock's position. Observations from the two Voyager spacecraft inside the heliosheath indicate significant differences between them, suggesting that apart from the dynamic nature caused by changing solar activity there also may exist a global asymmetry in the north-south (polar) dimensions of the heliosphere, in addition to the expected nose-tail asymmetry. This relates to the direction in which the heliosphere is moving in interstellar space and its orientation with respect to the interstellar magnetic field. In this paper we focus on illustrating the effects of this north-south asymmetry on modulation of galactic cosmic ray Carbon, between polar angles of 55\u00b0 and 125\u00b0, using a numerical model which includes all four major modulation processes, the termination shock and the heliosheath. This asymmetry is incorporated in the model by assuming a significant dependence on heliolatitude of the thickness of the heliosheath. When comparing the computed spectra between the two polar angles, we find that at energies E &lt; \u223c1.0 GeV the effects of the assumed asymmetry on the modulated spectra are insignificant up to 60 AU from the Sun but become increasingly more significant with larger radial distances to reach a maximum inside the heliosheath. In contrast, with E &gt; \u223c1.0 GeV, these effects remain insignificant throughout the heliosphere even very close to the heliopause. Furthermore, we find that a higher local interstellar spectrum for Carbon enhances the effects of asymmetric modulation between the two polar angles at lower energies ( E &lt; \u223c300 MeV). In conclusion, it is found that north-south asymmetrical effects on the modulation of cosmic ray Carbon depend strongly on the extent of the geometrical asymmetry of the heliosheath together with the assumed value of the local interstellar spectrum.",

         "abstract": "The existence of a \"dense\" lunar ionosphere has been controversial for decades. Positive ions produced from the lunar surface and exosphere are inferred to have densities that are \u2272 10<SUP>6</SUP> - 10<SUP>7</SUP> m<SUP>-3</SUP> near the surface and smaller at higher altitudes, yet electron densities derived from radio occultation measurements occasionally exceed these values by orders of magnitude. For example, about 4% of the single-spacecraft radio occultation measurements from Kaguya/SELENE were consistent with peak electron densities of ~ 3 \u00d710<SUP>8</SUP> m<SUP>-3</SUP>. Space plasmas should be neutral on macroscopic scales, so this represents a substantial discrepancy. Aditional observations of electron densities in the lunar ionosphere are critical to resolving this longstanding paradox. Here we theoretically assess whether radio occultation observations using two-way coherent S-band radio signals from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft could provide useful measurements of electron densities in the lunar ionosphere. We predict the uncertainty in a single LRO radio occultation measurement of electron density to be ~ 3 \u00d710<SUP>8</SUP> m<SUP>-3</SUP>, comparable to occasional observations by Kaguya/SELENE of a dense lunar ionosphere. Thus an individual profile from LRO is unlikely to reliably detect the lunar ionosphere; however, averages of multiple (~ 10) LRO profiles acquired under similar geophysical and viewing conditions should be able to make reliable detections. An observing rate of six ingress occultations per day (~ 2000 per year) could be achieved with minimal impact on current LRO operations. This rate compares favorably with the 378 observations reported from the single-spacecraft experiment on Kaguya/SELENE between November 2007 and June 2009. The large number of observations possible for LRO would be sufficient to permit wide-ranging investigations of spatial and temporal variations in the poorly understood lunar ionosphere. These findings strengthen efforts to conduct such observations with LRO.",

         "abstract": "We present the method of automatic forecasting of the impacts of Solar Cosmic Ray (SCR)/Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) and estimation of radiation hazard level. We use the model of SCR/SEP diffusion in general form and coupling functions for neutron monitors of worldwide network with different altitudes and cutoff rigidities, including space detectors such as GOES-11,12. Another observational data for the estimation of energy spectra of SCR/SEP are measurements of different neutron multiplicities by some neutron monitors (e.g., for great SCR/SEP event held in September 29, 1989). A 1-min data of muon telescopes and ionization chambers shielded by 10-cm PB are used for the detection of the highest-energy SCR/SEP components (e.g., for SCR/SEP events held on February 23, 1956; Dorman, 1957). We demonstrate algorithms to automatically estimate event starting times, determine the time evolution of SCR/SEP in space using coupling functions in the frame of spectrographic method, solve inverse problems associated with SCR/SEP generation in solar corona and propagation in the interplanetary space, automatically determine escaping into solar wind and propagation in space based on the CR observation data parameters of SCR/SEP generation and propagation in solar corona. Based on these parameters, we show that it is possible to automatically forecast the first 0.5 h data on expected level of radiation hazards from a full-time event (up to about 48 h) for objects in space on different distances from the Sun, in magnetosphere at different orbits, and in atmosphere at different altitudes and cutoff rigidities. It is important, before the start of the automatic forecasting procedure, to calculate the expected level of radiation hazards for full time of event by determining every 5-10 min recalculated forecasting fluxes of SCR/SEP in space, out of magnetosphere, back to the CR ground detectors, and detectors on satellites using the same coupling functions. If the difference between the obtained results and observed data is smaller or no statistical errors, it is possible to provide effective forecasting automatically and subsequently calculate the expected level of radiation hazards. If the expected level of radiation hazards is high in certain objects, after about 0.5 h from the event starting time, it will be formatted and a corresponding alert is sent. The same alerts will be repeated with time for different objects in space, in magnetosphere, and in atmosphere. Based on the first 0.5 h data from event beginning, the radiation hazard level from high-energy particles such as SCR/SEP is considered to be low (with very small flux). If with increasing time the radiation hazard level rises with energy \u22641 GeV, it is formatted. Also, at the beginning of some SCR/SEP events when the Earth is on or near the force line of IMF connected with the source of SCR/SEP, several CR stations with direct arriving along the magnetic force line with about no scattering SCR/SEP particles on magnetic inhomogeneities will show strong narrow pulse with no information on SCR/SEP diffusion during the propagation from the source to the detector. These CR stations at the beginning of the SCR/SEP event can be used only for estimating SCR/SEP energy spectrum in the source and at the time of injection into solar wind but not on diffusion. Hence, it is necessary to automatically separate the CR stations with strong narrow pulses and exclude them from diffusion analysis. We strive to make this automatic using a program of image identification in the frame of MATLAB.",

A full three-dimensional numerical model based on Parker's transport equation is used to study the modulation of 10 MeV galactic electrons, in particular inside the heliosheath. The emphasis is placed on the role that perpendicular diffusion plays in causing the extraordinary large increase in the observed intensities of these electrons in the heliosheath. The modelling is compared with observations of 6-14 MeV electrons from the Voyager 1 mission. Results are shown for the radial intensity profiles of these electrons, as well as the modulation effects of varying the extent of the heliosheath by changing the location of the termination shock and the heliopause and the value of the local interstellar spectrum. We confirm that the heliosheath acts as a modulation 'barrier' for low-energy galactic electrons. The significance of this result depends on how wide the inner heliosheath is; on how high the very local interstellar spectrum is at these low energies (E &lt; 100 MeV) and on how small perpendicular diffusion is inside the inner heliosheath.",

         "abstract": "Observations made with the two Voyager spacecraft confirmed that the solar wind decelerates to form the heliospheric termination shock and that it has begun its merger with the local interstellar medium. The compression ratio of this shock affects galactic cosmic rays when they enter the heliosphere. Hydrodynamic (HD) models show that the compression ratio can have a significant latitude dependence; with the largest value in the nose direction of the heliosphere, becoming significantly less towards the polar regions. The modulation effects of such large latitude dependence are studied, using a well-established numerical drift and shock modulation model. We focus on computing the modulated spectra for galactic protons with emphasis on the radial and polar gradients in the equatorial plane and at a polar angle of \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, corresponding to the heliolatitude of Voyager 1. Two sets of solutions are computed and compared each time; with and without a latitude dependence for the compression ratio. All computations are done for the two magnetic field polarity cycles assuming solar minimum conditions. Including the termination shock in the model allows the study of the re-acceleration of galactic protons in the outer heliosphere. We find that for the A &lt; 0 polarity cycle the intensity between \u223c200 MeV and \u223c1 GeV in the vicinity of the shock in the heliospheric equatorial plane may exceed the local interstellar value specified at the heliopause. Unfortunately, at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, the effect is reduced. This seems not possible during an A &gt; 0 cycle because significant modulation is then predicted between the heliopause and the termination shock, depending on how strong global gradient and curvature drifts are in the heliosheath. The overall effect of the shock on galactic protons in the equatorial plane is to reduce the total modulation as a function of radial distance with respect to the interstellar spectrum. Making the compression ratio latitude dependent enhances these effects at energies E &lt; 200 MeV in the equatorial plane. At larger heliolatitudes these effects are even more significant. The differences in the modulation between the two drift cycles are compelling when the compression ratio is made latitude dependent but at Earth this effect is insignificant. A general result is that the computed radial gradient changes for galactic protons at and close to the TS and that these changes are polarity dependent. In line with previous work, large polarity dependent effects are predicted for the inner heliosphere and also close to the shock\u2019s position in the equatorial plane. In contrast, at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, the largest polarity effect occurs in the middle heliosphere (50 AU), enhanced by the latitude dependence of the compression ratio. At this latitude, the amount of proton modulation between the heliopause and the termination shock is much reduced. If galactic cosmic rays were to experience some diffusive shock acceleration over the 100-1000 MeV range at the shock, the radial gradient should change its sign in the vicinity of the shock, how large, depends on the compression ratio and the amount of drifts taking place in the outer heliosphere. The effective polar gradient shows a strong polarity dependence at Earth but this dissipates at \u03b8 = 55\u00b0, especially with increasing radial distance. This tendency is enhanced by making the compression ratio latitude dependent.",

         "abstract": "Substorm onset timing is a critical issue in magnetotail dynamics research. Solar wind energy is accumulated in the magnetosphere and the configuration of the magnetosphere evolves toward an unstable state during the growth phase. At some point, the expansion phase begins and the stored energy is released through a variety of processes that return the magnetosphere to a lower energy state. In recovery the various processes die away. Unfortunately, the ground and magnetospheric signatures of onset, i.e. energy release, can be seen both in the growth phase prior to onset and in the expansion phase after onset. Some investigators refer to each of these events as a substorm. Tail observations suggest that most substorms have one event that differentiates the behavior of the tail field and plasma. We refer to this time as the \"main substorm onset\". Each substorm associated phenomenon is timed independently and then compared with main substorm onsets. ISEE-2 tail observations are used to examine the tail lobe magnetic conditions associated with substorms because ISEE-2 orbit has a high inclination and frequently observes lobe field. Approximately 70 \u223c 75% of tail lobe B<SUB>t</SUB> and B<SUB>z</SUB> change are associated with the main substorm onset. If the satellite is more than 3 Re above (below) the neutral sheet, 86% (57%) of plasma pressure dropouts are associated with substorms. We interpret our results as evidence that the effect of the growth phase is to drive the magnetosphere towards instability. As it approaches global instability local regions become temporarily unstable but are rapidly quenched. Eventually one of these events develops into the global instability that releases most of the stored energy and returns the magnetosphere to a more stable configuration.",

Here that analysis is extended and studied variations in the mean maximum sizes (the mean values of maximum areas) of the aforementioned three classes of sunspot groups and also their combination. It is found that there is no significant correlation between the mean maximum size of any class of sunspot groups and the International Sunspot Number (R), probably due to in a given time interval small sunspot groups/sunspots outnumber the large ones. A pattern of an approximate 9-year period cycle is seen in the variations of the mean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups during a solar cycle. On long-time scales it is found that there exists a strong 130 or more years cycle in the variation of the mean size of the small sunspot groups, whereas there is a hint on the existence of \u224844-year cycles in the variations of the mean maximum sizes of the large and the big sunspot groups. During the decline phase of cycle 23, there was a scarcity in the sunspot groups whose A\u2a7d37msh, which may be related to the slow growth of sunspot groups during this period. During the minimum between cycles 23 and 24 may be due to the presence of a number of small sunspot groups whose A&gt;37 was larger than that of whose A\u2a7d37, the relatively large size coronal holes were present at low-latitudes and the total solar irradiance was very low.",

Fourier spectra of ion flux fluctuations are systematically analyzed both in the solar wind and in the magnetosheath on the inertial scale and on a transition to the dissipation scale in the range of 0.01-10 Hz. We show that ion flux fluctuation spectra in the flank magnetosheath are similar to those observed in the solar wind and we demonstrate the presence of the break at frequencies of \u223c1-2 Hz. Spectra are slightly steeper in the flank magnetosheath but the break frequency is near twice less in a comparison to the solar wind. The magnetosheath ion flux turbulent flow is intermittent as it was shown earlier for the solar wind. We discuss the level of intermittency of ion flux fluctuations in both regions and we determine the characteristics of structure functions.

We predict possible future 133-242 MeV proton observations along the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft trajectories. Recent theoretical advances in cosmic ray transport parameters are introduced in order to provide a time-dependence for the assumed transport parameters used in the model. This leads to results that are in general compatible with the spacecraft observations in the inner and outer heliosphere over multiple solar cycles. However, for the outer heliosphere, we find that the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft observations cannot be fitted with an identical set of parameters along both trajectories. This indicates a possible asymmetric heliosphere or a symmetric heliosphere but with different diffusion parameters in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Furthermore, results indicate that Voyager 2 observations are still under the influence of solar cycle related changes because of the large modulation volume between the heliopause and spacecraft location in contrast to Voyager 1 which shows a steady increase in cosmic ray intensities.",

         "abstract": "Observations of galactic Carbon in the heliosphere provide a useful tool with which a comprehensive description of the global modulation of cosmic rays both inside and outside off the solar wind termination shock (TS) can be made. This is, in part, because galactic Carbon is not contaminated by anomalous cosmic rays as is the case for oxygen, helium and hydrogen. However, this kind of study requires that there should be reasonable compatibility of model solutions to spacecraft and earthbound observations. In this study, the well-established two-dimensional model that contains a TS, a heliosheath, as well as shock re-acceleration of galactic cosmic rays and particle drifts, is used first to study modulation from solar minimum to moderate maximum activity at Earth. This model can handle any global heliospheric geometry of both the TS and heliopause (HP) positions. Second, the model is applied to study the contribution of drifts and the enhancement of polar perpendicular diffusion in the heliosheath to the total modulation in the heliosphere as a function of energy for both polarity cycles of the magnetic field during solar minimum conditions. This modeling is done with a new heliopause spectrum (HPS, usually referred to as the local interstellar spectrum) at kinetic energy E &lt; \u223c200 MeV/nuc. This HPS is derived from observations made by the Voyager 1 spacecraft of galactic Carbon at a radial distance of \u223c122 AU from the Sun. We find that: (1) The model gives realistic modulation for both magnetic polarity cycles of the Sun, from Earth to beyond the TS, and that the level of modulation at Earth between the recent solar minimum and the previous moderate maximum condition exceed that between the HP and Earth in the recent solar minimum. (2) Neglecting drifts in the heliosheath along the Voyager heliolatitude is a reasonable assumption, but in the equatorial plane of the heliosphere drifts are important for heliosheath modulation in the A &lt; 0 polarity cycle, especially when galactic particles are re-accelerated at the TS. (3) The contribution of the enhancement of the polar perpendicular diffusion in the heliosheath to the total modulation seems insignificant. (4) The new HPS as observed by Voyager 1 at E &lt; \u223c200 MeV/nuc is found to be significantly higher than previous estimates, for example, at E = 100 MeV/nuc by a factor of \u223c2. We find that the total modulation between the HP and Earth at 10 MeV/nuc causes the intensity at Earth to be only \u223c4.5% of the HPS, whereas for 100 MeV/nuc it is \u223c17.5%. Respectively, this means that the global radial gradient for galactic Carbon for this period was \u223c2.5%/AU and \u223c1.4%/AU, if the heliopause is taken at 122 AU.",

In low Earth Orbits (LEO) neutral atmospheric density uncertainty is the main contributor to orbital state vector uncertainty. Grid-scale model uncertainty on the other hand is, in most cases, the dominating component of atmospheric density uncertainty. <P />Prior research in the field of density uncertainty has been broad. Nowadays multiple authors seem to agree that a first-order stochastic Gauss-Markov process, also known as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP), is an appropriate stochastic representation for density model uncertainties. While many have studied orbital variations due to stochastic grid-scale density uncertainty, it is believed that the work at hand provides for the first time explicit analytic equations for the estimation of orbital uncertainties due to an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that has been optimized for the representation of atmospheric density. It is shown that the long-term in-track position error due to this modified OUP grows with t<SUP>3</SUP> . <P />The presented derivations and their validation build upon prior work by Emmert et al. and Sagni\u00e8res and Sharf. Numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to validate the findings with two different semi-empirical density models.

We derived and analyzed EC estimates in several representative altitudinal intervals for the ionosphere and the plasmasphere from the COSMIC GPS radio occultation, ground-based GPS and Jason-2 joint altimeter/GPS observations. It allows us to estimate a quantitative impact of the ionospheric electron density profiles formulation in several altitudinal intervals and to examine the source of the model-data discrepancies of the EC specification from the bottom-side ionosphere towards the GPS orbit altitudes. The most pronounced model-data differences were found at the low latitude region as related to the equatorial ionization anomaly appearance. Both the IRI-2016 and NeQuick-2 models tend to overestimate the daytime ionospheric EC and TEC at low latitudes during all seasons of low solar activity. On the contrary, during high solar activity the model results underestimated the EC/TEC observations at low latitudes. We found that both models underestimated the EC for the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere regions for all levels of solar activity. For low solar activity, the underestimated EC from the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere can compensate the overestimation of the ionospheric EC and, consequently, can slightly decrease the resulted model overestimation of the ground-based TEC. For high solar activity, the underestimated EC from the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere leads to a strengthening of the model underestimation of the ground-based TEC values. We demonstrated that the major source of the model-data discrepancies in the EC/TEC domain comes from the topside ionosphere/plasmasphere system.",

         "abstract": "Observations of unusually large magnetic fields in the ionosphere indicate periods of maximum stress on Titan's ionosphere and potentially of the strongest loss rates of ionospheric plasma. During Titan flyby T42, the observed magnetic field attained a maximum value of 37 nT between an altitude of 1200 and 1600 km, about 20 nT stronger than on any other Titan pass and close to five times greater in magnetic pressure. The strong fields occurred near the corotation-flow terminator rather than at the sub-flow point, suggesting that the flow which magnetized the ionosphere was from a direction far from corotation and possibly towards Saturn. Extrapolation of solar wind plasma conditions from Earth to Saturn using the University of Michigan MHD code predicts an enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure at Saturn close to this time. Cassini's earlier exits from Saturn's magnetosphere support this prediction because the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer instrument saw a magnetopause crossing three hours before the strong field observation. Thus it appears that Titan's ionosphere was magnetized when the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure compressed the Saturnian magnetosphere, and perhaps the magnetosheath magnetic field, against Titan. The solar wind pressure then decreased, leaving a strong fossil field in the ionosphere. When observed, this strong magnetic flux tube had begun to twist, further enhancing its strength.",

         "abstract": "An algorithm has been developed that retrieves water vapour profiles in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere from optical depth spectra obtained by the Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) instrument onboard the SCISAT satellite as part of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) mission. The retrieval relies on ro-vibrational absorption of solar radiation by water vapour in the 926-970 nm range. During the iterative inversion process, the optical depth spectra are simulated at the spectral resolution and sampling frequency of MAESTRO using the correlated- k approximation. The Chahine inversion updates the water vapour volume mixing ratio (VMR), adjusting all retrieval layers simultaneously, to match the observed differential optical depth due to absorption by water vapour and ozone at each tangent height. This approach accounts for significant line saturation effects. Profiles are typically obtained from \u223c22 km down to the cloud tops or to 5 km, with relative precision as small as 3% in the troposphere. In the lower stratosphere, the precision on water vapour VMR is \u223c1.3 \u03bcmol/mol in an individual retrieval layer (\u223c1 km thick). The spectral capability of MAESTRO allows for the clear separation of extinction due to water vapour and aerosol, and for the fitting quality to be quantified and used to determine an altitude-dependent convergence criterion for the retrieval. In the middle troposphere, interhemispheric differences in water vapour VMR are driven by oceanic evaporation whereas in the upper troposphere, deep convection dominates and a strong seasonal cycle is observed at high latitudes.",

In the previous paper (Morozova et al., 2017) we mainly discussed the first mode of principal component analysis of tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature and pressure fields, which was shown to be correlated with lower stratospheric ozone and anti-correlated with cosmic ray flux. Now we extend the investigation to the second mode, which suggests a coupling between the stratosphere and the ionosphere. <P />This second mode, located in the low and middle stratosphere (and explaining ~7% of temperature and ~3% of geopotential height variations), showed to be statistically significantly correlated with variations of the middle stratosphere ozone content and anti-correlated with variations of ionospheric total electron content. Similar co-variability of these stratospheric and ionospheric parameters was also obtained with the wavelet cross-coherence analysis. <P />To investigate the role of atmospheric circulation dynamics and the causal nature of the found correlations, we applied the convergent cross mapping (CCM) analysis to our series. Strong evidence for the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling were obtained for the winter 2012-2013 that is characterized by the easterly QBO phase (quasi-biennial oscillations of the direction of the stratospheric zonal winds) and a strong SSW (sudden stratospheric warming event). Further analysis (for the three-year time interval 2012-2015) hint that SSWs events play main role in emphasizing the stratosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

         "abstract": "Periodicity in occurrence of magnetic disturbances in polar cap and auroral zone under conditions of steady and powerful solar wind influence on the magnetosphere is analyzed on the example of 9 storm events with distinctly expressed sawtooth substorms (N = 48). Relationships between the polar cap magnetic activity (PC-index), magnetic disturbances in the auroral zone (AL-index) and value of the ring current asymmetry (ASYM index) were examined within the intervals of the PC growth phase and the PC decline phase inherent to each substorm. It is shown that the substorm sudden onsets are always preceded by the PC growth and that the substorm development does not affect the PC growth rate. On achieving the disturbance maximum, the PC and AL indices are simultaneously fall down to the level preceding the substorm, so that the higher the substorm intensity, the larger is the AL and PC drop in the decline phase. The ASYM index increases and decreases in conformity with the PC and AL behavior, the correlation between ASYM and PC being better than between ASYM and AL. Level of the solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere determines periodicity and intensity of disturbances: the higher the coupling function E<SUB>KL</SUB>, the higher is substorm intensity and shorter is substorm length. Taking into account the permanently high level of auroral activity and inconsistency of aurora behavior and magnetic onsets during sawtooth substorms, the conclusion is made that auroral ionosphere conductivity is typically high and ensures an extremely high intensity of field-aligned currents in R1 FAC system. The periodicity of sawtooth substorms is determined by recurrent depletions and restorations of R1 currents, which are responsible for coordinated variations of magnetic activity in the polar cap and auroral zone.",

It is shown that IRI prediction errors could increase for the F2 layer critical frequency foF2 and the peak height hmF2 due to erroneous predictions of the ionospheric global IG index and the international sunspot number SSN1 index on which IRI and IRI-Plas models are built. Regression relation is introduced to produce daily SSN1 proxy index from new time series SSN2 index provided from June 2015, after recalibration of sunspots data. To avoid extra errors of the ionosphere model a new solar activity prediction (SAP) model for the ascending part of the solar cycle SC25 is proposed which expresses analytically the SSN1 proxy index and the 10.7-cm radio flux F10.7 index in terms of the phase of the solar cycle, \u03a6. SAP model is based on monthly indices observed during the descending part of SC24 complemented with forecast of time and amplitude for SC25 peak.

         "abstract": "During the geomagnetic storm periods, the convection electric field penetrates promptly to equatorial latitudes, causing an eastward electric field in the dayside ionosphere. Occasionally, the polarity of the dayside ionospheric electric field is inverted when the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) turns northward. In this paper, interesting observations of the strong westward electric field in the day side equatorial latitudes are presented, as evidenced by strong Counter Electrojet (CEJ) at Indian and Japanese sectors under the steady southward IMF Bz. The westward electric field perturbations are quite large with CEJ amplitude of \u223c-120 nT over the Indian sector (14-15 December 2006) and \u223c-220 nT for Japanese sector (7-8 November 2004). The plausible mechanisms for the observed overshielding electric fields under steady southward IMF Bz have been investigated in light of the possible role of substorm activity. The clear signatures of substorm were observed at geosynchronous particle flux measurements from LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) satellite and associated with sudden decrease in AL index. The observed variations of asymmetric ring current shows the enhancement of Partial Ring Current (PRC) at the dusk sector further supporting the substorm onset during that period which will probably enhance the overshielding due to increased Region 2 Field-Aligned Currents (R2 FACs). The observations of such significantly large amplitudes of CEJ associated with the substorm related overshielding events are sparse and the results bring out the important role of substorm onset and the development of PRC in accordance with the R2 FACs during intense magnetic storms which alter the day time equatorial electric field perturbations.",

It is shown that inconsistency between the above signatures of the substorms onset is typical of the powerful sawtooth substorms, unlike the isolated (\u201cclassical\u201d) magnetospheric substorms. The distinguishing feature of the aurora in case of saw-tooth substorms is permanently high level of auroral activity irrespective of the magnetic disturbance onsets and the double oval structure of the aurora display. The close relationship between the aurora behavior and the particle injections at geostationary orbit is also broken. The conclusion is made, that the classical concept of the substorm development, put forward by Akasofu (1964) for isolated substorms, is not workable in cases of the sawtooth disturbances, when the powerful solar wind energy pumping into the magnetosphere provides a permanent powerful aurora particle precipitation into the auroral zone.",

         "abstract": "Large initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis or force-model uncertainties, such as atmospheric density uncertainty are key drivers of the along-track uncertainty growth. Long propagation times may result in the need to use filtering algorithms for orbit determination that do not reside to the assumption of Gaussianity for state errors but estimate the entire probability density function. Adaptive Gaussian mixture based filters have shown promising results in the past. Previous research in the field of orbit determination using Gaussian mixture filters has restricted its attention to initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction. The present paper focuses on the consequences of including realistic, physics-based descriptions of atmospheric density uncertainty into the covariance propagation of the mixture kernels. <P />It is shown that the neglect of process noise, as has been customary for many years, can lead to undesired characteristics of the probability density function (pdf) estimates and that the inclusion of atmospheric density uncertainty process noise, even in cases where it is not the dominant driver of along-track uncertainty growth, is able to correct these deficiencies. For low orbiting satellites with increased ballistic coefficients or small initial uncertainties in the semi-major axis direction, density uncertainty is the dominant driver of the along-track uncertainty increase. Due to its growth that evolves at least cubic in time, situations may arise which require the usage of Gaussian mixtures also for the process noise when working in Cartesian coordinates. The theoretical foundation for this case is elaborated and an algorithm capable of dynamically switching between a single Gaussian and a Gaussian mixture for the density uncertainty process noise is presented.",

For this purpose, the obtained EPB longitudinal patterns were compared with the thermosphere and ionosphere characteristics having the prominent \"wave-like\" longitudinal structures with wave number 4, which are uniquely associated with the influence of the troposphere DE3 tides. The characteristics of the equatorial mass density anomaly (EMA), equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA), zonal wind and pre-reversal E \u00d7 B drift enhancement (PRE) were used for comparison. The equinox seasons during high solar activity were under consideration. It was obtained that the longitudinal patterns of the EMA and zonal wind show the surprising similarity with the EPB distributions (R \u2245 0.8, R \u2245 0.72). On the other hand, the resemblance with the ionosphere characteristics (EIA, PRE) is rather faint (R \u2245 0.37, R \u2245 0.12). It was shown that the thermosphere zonal winds are the most possible transfer mediator of the troposphere DE3 tide influence. The most successful moment for the transfer of the troposphere DE3 tide energy takes place in the beginning of the EPB production, namely, during the seed perturbation development.",

         "abstract": "Plasmaspheric electron content is, beyond the ionosphere as major source, a significant contributor to the overall TEC budget affecting GNSS signals. The plasmasphere can induce half or more of the GNSS range errors caused by atmospheric electrical charges, in particular at nighttime. At DLR Neustrelitz, Germany, GPS measurements recorded onboard the LEO satellite CHAMP were used to reconstruct the topside electron density distribution (ionosphere and plasmasphere) up to GPS altitude, applying a model-based assimilation technique. In this paper, the potential of these CHAMP topside reconstructions for analyzing space weather related changes in the geo-plasma is investigated. For this purpose, comparisons are made between the CHAMP reconstructed profiles and electron densities derived from passive radio wave observations by the IMAGE RPI instrument for years 2001 till 2005. <P />The comparison results indicate that an improvement, compared to the electron density of a background model, can be achieved by CHAMP data assimilation. The improvement is especially visible in the L-shell region below 3, which contributes notably to the GNSS signal delays. However, for the region around the plasmapause, systematical electron density underestimations of the background model w.r.t. the IMAGE data are detected. The rather limited CHAMP data coverage and the degraded observation geometry at these high altitudes seem to be not sufficient for complete compensation of this underestimation during the assimilation procedure. <P />The results presented in this paper demonstrate the strengths of LEO TEC data assimilation, but at the same time illustrate the necessity to improve the modeling of the plasmasphere region above 4 ER L-shell distances. Furthermore, they reveal the need of additional data to establish an appropriate data base for the modeling of the complete plasmasphere.",

         "abstract": "Understanding the thermosphere and ionosphere conditions is crucial for spacecraft operations and many applications using radio signal transmission (e.g. in communication and navigation). In this sense, physics based modelling plays an important role, since it can adequately reproduce the complex coupling mechanisms in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system. The accuracy of the physics based model results does not only depend on the appropriate implementation of the physical processes, but also on the quality of the input data (forcing). In this study, we analyze the impact of input data uncertainties on the model results. We use the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere electrodynamics model (CTIPe), which requires satellite based solar wind, interplanetary field and hemispheric power data from ACE and TIROS/NOAA missions. To identify the impact of the forcing uncertainties, two model runs are compared against each other. The first run uses the input data that were available in real-time (operational) and the second run uses the best estimate obtained in post-processing (research or historical run). The analysis is performed in a case study on the 20th November 2003 extreme geomagnetic storm, that caused significant perturbations in the MIT system. This paper validates the thermosphere and ionosphere response to this storm over Europe comparing both CTIPe model runs with measurements of Total Electron Content (TEC) and thermosphere neutral density. In general, CTIPe results show a good agreement with measurements. However, the deviations between the model and observations are larger in the ionosphere than in the thermosphere. The comparison of the two model runs reveals that the deviations between model results and measurements are larger for the operational run than the research run. It is evident for the storm analyzed here, that data gaps in the input data are impacting considerably the model performance. The consistency between simulation and measurements allows the interpretation of the physical mechanisms behind the ionosphere perturbations and the changes in neutral composition during this event. Joule heating in the Auroral region, generating meridional winds and large scale surges, is suggested to be the main driver of the positive ionospheric storm over central Europe. In the polar cap and Auroral region, convection processes dominate the thermosphere-ionosphere conditions. This study does not only illustrate the importance of working with a good estimate of the model forcing, but also indicates the necessity of using measurements and models, to get a better understanding of the most likely responsible processes for the observed storm effects.",

For the same period, three different atmospheric models show over-estimation of temperature (\u223c10 K) near the stratopause and in the upper mesosphere, and a signature of under-estimation is seen above mesopause when compared against SABER measured temperature profiles. Estimation of monthly temperature anomalies reveals a semiannual and ter-annual oscillation moving downward from the mesosphere to the stratosphere during January to December. Moreover, Lomb Scargle periodogram (LSP) and Wavelet transform techniques are employed to characterize the semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations to diagnose the wave dynamics in the stratosphere-mesosphere system. Results suggested that semi-annual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations are exist in stratosphere, whereas, semi-annual and annual oscillations are observed in mesosphere. In lower mesosphere, LSP analyses revealed conspicuous absence of annual oscillations in altitude range of \u223c55-65 km, and semi-annual oscillations are not existing in 35-45 km. Four monthly oscillations are also reported in the altitude range of about 45-65 km. The temporal localization of oscillations using wavelet analysis shows strong annual oscillation during year 2004-2006 and 2009-2011.",

         "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to a theoretical interpretation of Interball-1 satellite measurements data in two cases of the satellite's crossings of the magnetosheath. An interpretation is made of both the measured crossings of the magnetosheath boundaries and the behavior of the registered plasma parameters. In our case, it is the value of the ion flux along the spacecraft trajectory. The magnetosheath-magnetosphere model, developed at the Institute of Mechanics, Sofia, Bulgaria, is used as a theoretical basis. It describes the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere in a simplified gas-dynamic approximation. A characteristic feature of the model is that it allows for the self-consistent description of the magnetosheath boundaries - the bow shock (BS) and the magnetopause (MP). The three-dimensional picture of the magnetosheath fluid flow is also obtained as part of the solution. The magnetosheath characteristics thus obtained are in correspondence with a given momentary state of the interplanetary medium, defined on the basis of WIND satellite data (appropriately shifted by time). The results are discussed in the context of advantages and limitations of using the gas-dynamic model for the interpretation of magnetosheath plasma measurements in the near-magnetopause magnetosheath.",

         "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification has recently been receiving much attention from aerospace engineering community. With ever-increasing requirements for robustness and reliability, it is crucial to quantify multidisciplinary uncertainty in satellite system design which dominates overall design direction and cost. However, coupled multi-disciplines and cross propagation hamper the efficiency and accuracy of high-dimensional uncertainty analysis. In this study, an uncertainty quantification methodology based on active subspaces is established for satellite conceptual design. The active subspace effectively reduces the dimension and measures the contributions of input uncertainties. A comprehensive characterization of associated uncertain factors is made and all subsystem models are built for uncertainty propagation. By integrating a system decoupling strategy, the multidisciplinary uncertainty effect is efficiently represented by a one-dimensional active subspace for each design. The identified active subspace is checked by bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals and verified by Monte Carlo propagation for the accuracy. To show the performance of active subspaces, 18 uncertainty parameters of an Earth observation small satellite are exemplified and then another 5 design uncertainties are incorporated. The uncertainties that contribute the most to satellite mass and total cost are ranked, and the quantification of high-dimensional uncertainty is achieved by a relatively small number of support samples. The methodology with considerably less cost exhibits high accuracy and strong adaptability, which provides a potential template to tackle multidisciplinary uncertainty in practical satellite systems.",

         "abstract": "Moderate geomagnetic storms occurred during January 22-25, 2012 period. The geomagnetic storms are characterized by different indices and parameters. The SYM-H value on January 22 increased abruptly to 67 nT at sudden storm commencement (SSC), followed by a sharp decrease to -87 nT. A second SSC on January 24 followed by a shock on January 25 was also observed. These SSCs before the main storms and the short recovery periods imply the geomagnetic storms are CME-driven. The sudden jump of solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF B<SUB>z</SUB> are also consistent with occurrence of CMEs. This is also reflected in the change in total electron content (TEC) during the storm relative to quiet days globally. The response of the ionospheric to geomagnetic storms can also be detected from wave components that account for the majority of TEC variance during the period. The dominant coherent modes of TEC variability are diurnal and semidiurnal signals which account upto 83% and 30% of the total TEC variance over fairly exclusive ionospheric regions respectively. Comparison of TEC anomalies attributed to diurnal (DW1) and semidiurnal (SW2) tides, as well as stationary planetary waves (SPW1) at 12 UTC shows enhancement in the positive anomalies following the storm. Moreover, the impact of the geomagnetic storms are distinctly marked in the daily time series of amplitudes of DW1, SW2 and SPW1. The abrupt changes in amplitudes of DW1 (5 TECU) and SW2 (2 TECU) are observed within 20\u00b0S-20\u00b0N latitude band and along 20\u00b0N respectively while that of SPW1 is about 3 TECU. Coherent oscillation with a period of 2.4 days between interplanetary magnetic field and TEC was detected during the storm. This oscillation is also detected in the amplitudes of DW1 over EIA regions in both hemispheres. Eventhough upward coupling of quasi two day wave (QTDWs) of the same periodicity, known to have caused such oscillation, are detected in both ionosphere and upper stratosphere, this one can likely be attributed to the geomagnetic storm as it happens after the storm commencement. Moreover, further analysis has indicated that QTDWs in the ionosphere are strengthened as a result of coherent oscillation of interplanetary magnetic field with the same frequency as QTDWs. On the otherhand, occurrences of minor SSW and geomagnetic storms in quick succession complicated clear demarcation of attribution of the respective events to variability of QTDWs amplitudes over upper stratosphere.",

The annual percentage occurrence of the positive ionosphere storms W index (pW<SUP>+</SUP>) and negative index (pW<SUP>-</SUP>) is determined. It is found that the occurrence of the ionosphere plasma depletion pW<SUP>-</SUP> of the instant foF2 as compared to the monthly median is well correlated with the aa index at all three sites (cc &gt; 0.85). The positive storm signatures of the plasma density enhancement pW<SUP>+</SUP> show high correlation with the geomagnetic activity aa index at Slough (cc = 0.68) and Moscow (cc = 0.92) but drastic difference of missing correlation at Canberra (cc = 0.06).

Density uncertainty is caused by model-uncertainty at spatial scales below and within the model resolution, as well as input-uncertainty of the environmental parameters supplied to the semi-empirical atmospheric model. <P />The paper at hand provides multiple contributions. First, analytic equations are derived to estimate the relative density error due to an input parameter uncertainty in any of the environmental parameters supplied to the model. Second, it is shown on the example of uncertain geomagnetic activity information, how to compute the required inputs to facilitate the accurate estimation of the relative density error. <P />A clamped cubic splining approach for the conversion from geomagnetic amplitude (ap) to the kp index is postulated to perform this uncertainty propagation, as other algorithms were found unsuitable for this task. Results of numerical simulations with three popular semi-empirical models are provided to validate the set of derived equations. It is found that geomagnetic input uncertainty is especially important to consider in case of low global geomagnetic activity. The findings seamlessly integrate with prior work by the authors to perform density-uncertainty considering orbit estimation.",

         "abstract": "The influence of quasi-static electric field of seismic origin on the characteristics of the internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the Earth's ionosphere is considered. The electric field in the ionosphere arises due to the injection of charged aerosols into the atmosphere, formation of an EMF in the near Earth atmosphere and perturbation of the conductive electric current in the global electric circuit. Amplification of the electric current in seismic zone is accompanied by the formation of perturbation of the lower ionosphere that affects the amplitude and phase of VLF/LF signals. The action of the electric field on the IGWs is connected with the appearance of the Ampere's force in the ionosphere. In the spectral range of these waves the latter acts on the neutral component of the ionosphere plasma. As the result of this interaction the ionosphere starts to support the discrete spectrum of oscillations. Periods of their maximums increase as numbers of natural sequence. The existence of such peculiarities of the waves in the ionosphere is confirmed by observations.",

         "abstract": "The electron density of the topside ionosphere and the plasmasphere contributes essentially to the overall Total Electron Content (TEC) budget affecting Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals. The plasmasphere can cause half or even more of the GNSS range error budget due to ionospheric propagation errors. This paper presents a comparative study of different plasmasphere and topside ionosphere data aiming at establishing an appropriate database for plasmasphere modelling. We analyze electron density profiles along the geomagnetic field lines derived from the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite/Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) records of remote plasma sounding with radio waves. We compare these RPI profiles with 2D reconstructions of the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere electron density derived from GNSS based TEC measurements onboard the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite. Most of the coincidences between IMAGE profiles and CHAMP reconstructions are detected in the region with L-shell between 2 and 5. In general the CHAMP reconstructed electron densities are below the IMAGE profile densities, with median of the CHAMP minus IMAGE residuals around -588 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Additionally, a comparison is made with electron densities derived from passive radio wave RPI measurements onboard the IMAGE satellite. Over the available 2001-2005 period of IMAGE measurements, the considered combined data from the active and passive RPI operations cover the region within a latitude range of \u00b160\u00b0N, all longitudes, and an L-shell ranging from 1.2 to 15. In the coincidence regions (mainly 2 \u2a7d L \u2a7d 4), we check the agreement between available active and passive RPI data. The comparison shows that the measurements are well correlated, with a median residual of \u223c52 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The RMS and STD values of the relative residuals are around 22% and 21% respectively. In summary, the results encourage the application of IMAGE RPI data for plasmasphere and plasmapause modeling.",

         "abstract": "A method is proposed for reconstructing the electron density profiles N(h) of the IRI model from ionograms of topside satellite sounding of the ionosphere. An ionograms feature is the presence of traces of signal reflection from the Earth's surface. The profile reconstruction is carried out in two stages. At the first stage, the N(h) -profile is calculated from the lower boundary of the ionosphere to the satellite height (total profile) by the method presented in this paper using the ionogram. In this case, the monotonic profile of the topside ionosphere is calculated by the classical method. The profile of the inner ionosphere is represented by analytical functions, the parameters of which are calculated by optimization methods using traces of signal reflection, both from the topside ionosphere and from the Earth. At the second stage, the profile calculated from the ionogram is used to obtain the key parameters: the height of the maximum hmF2 of the F2 layer, the critical frequency foF2, the values of B0 and B1, which determine the profile shape in the F region in the IRI model. The input of key parameters, time of observation, and coordinates of sounding into the IRI model allows obtaining the IRI-profile corrected to real experimental conditions. The results of using the data of the ISIS-2 satellite show that the profiles calculated from the ionograms and the IRI profiles corrected from them are close to each other in the inner ionosphere and can differ significantly in the topside ionosphere. This indicates the possibility of obtaining a profile in the inner ionosphere close to the real distribution, which can significantly expand the information database useful for the IRTAM (IRI Realmax Assimilative Modeling) model. The calculated profiles can be used independently for local ionospheric research.",

The bottomside ionosphere, topside ionosphere and plasmaspheric contributions to the total electron content (TEC) derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS) observations are separately estimated from ionosonde and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation data. Over the ionosonde location, COSMIC electron density (Ne) profiles are considered when the maximum height of the F2 layer (hmF2) lies within spatial resolutions of 4.5 \u00b0 \u00d7 4.5 \u00b0 in latitudes/longitudes, and the Ne profile does not exceed 10 \u00b0 . For the first time, we have statistically quantified the topside ionosphere contribution to GPS TEC based on radio occultation data and revealed that it accounts for about 50% of the TEC during low solar activity periods. Finally, we have demonstrated that the determination of electron content contribution at different altitudes is important for understanding ionospheric storm mechanisms during space weather events especially geomagnetic storms.",

The situation becomes worse in the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) region, where the daytime ionization distribution is modified by the fountain effect that develops a crest of electron density at around \u00b115\u00b0 to \u00b120\u00b0 of the magnetic equator and a trough at the magnetic equator during the local noon hours. Related to this phenomenon is the appearance of ionosphere irregularities and plasma bubbles after local sunset. These may degrade further the quality of service obtained from the GNSS/SBAS system of the said periods. Considering the present operational augmentation systems, the accuracy and integrity of the ionosphere corrections estimate decreases as the level of disturbances increases. In order to provide a correct ionosphere correction to the user of GNSS operating in African EIA region and meet the integrity requirements, a certified ionosphere correction model that accurately characterizes EIA gradient with the full capacity to over-bound the residual error will be needed. An irregularities detector and a decorrelation adaptor are essential in an algorithm usable for African sub-Saharan SBAS operation. The algorithm should be able to cater to the equatorial plasma vertical drifts, diurnal and seasonal variability of the ionosphere electron density and also should take into account the large spatial and temporal gradients in the region. This study presents the assessment of the ionosphere threat model with single and multi-layer algorithm, using modified planar fit and Kriging approaches.",

         "abstract": "Electromagnetic extremely low frequency (ELF) waves play an important role in modulating the Earth's radiation belt electron dynamics. High-frequency (HF) modulated heating of the ionosphere acts as a viable means to generate artificial ELF waves. The artificial ELF waves can reside in two different plasma regions in geo-space by propagating in the ionosphere and penetrating into the magnetosphere. As a consequence, the entire trajectory of ELF wave propagation should be considered to carefully analyze the wave radiation properties resulting from modulated ionospheric heating. We adopt a model of full wave solution to evaluate the Poynting vector of the ELF radiation field in the ionosphere, which can reflect the propagation characteristics of the radiated ELF waves along the background magnetic field and provide the initial condition of waves for ray tracing in the magnetosphere. The results indicate that the induced ELF wave energy forms a collimated beam and the center of the ELF radiation shifts obviously with respect to the ambient magnetic field with the radiation power inversely proportional to the wave frequency. The intensity of ELF wave radiation also shows a weak correlation with the size of the radiation source or its geographical location. Furthermore, the combination of ELF propagation in the ionosphere and magnetosphere is proposed on basis of the characteristics of the ELF radiation field from the upper ionospheric boundary and ray tracing simulations are implemented to reasonably calculate magnetospheric ray paths of ELF waves induced by modulated ionospheric heating.",

This is a first article on real time application of numerical methods to obtain the parameters of traveling ionosphere disturbances (TIDs) using vertical incident ionograms. In this paper, the distribution of ionosphere electron density with TIDs is constructed using a background ionosphere model superimposed a perturbation theory model. The background ionosphere electron density is modelled by the inversion of vertical incident ionograms which are observed before the appearance of the disturbance. Based on the fourth order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (the so-called ABM) predictor corrector method, instead of Runge-Kutta method, the fast digital ray tracing method is established. According to process of the disturbed trace simulation and parameters inversion, the characteristic parameters of ionosphere disturbance at different detection time can be obtained in real time. The numerical analysis of TIDs is then captured completely.",

         "abstract": "Various studies have been performed to investigate the accuracy of troposphere zenith wet delays (ZWDs) determined from GPS. Most of these studies use dual-frequency GPS data of large-scale networks with long baselines to determine the absolute ZWDs. For small-scale networks the estimability of the absolute ZWDs deteriorates due to high correlation between the solutions of the ZWDs and satellite-specific parameters as satellite clocks. However, as relative ZWDs (rZWDs) can always be estimated, irrespective of the size of the network, it is of interest to understand how the large-scale network rZWD-performance of dual-frequency GPS using an ionosphere-float model compares to the small-scale network rZWD-performance of single-frequency GPS using an ionosphere-weighted model. In this contribution such an analysis is performed using undifferenced and uncombined network parametrization modelling. In this context we demonstrate the ionosphere weighted constraints, which allows the determination of the rZWDs independent from signals on the second frequency. Based on an analysis of both simulated and real data, it is found that under quiet ionosphere conditions, the accuracy of the single-frequency determined rZWDs in the ionosphere-weighted network is comparable to that of the large-scale dual-frequency network without ionospheric constraints. Making use of the real data from two baselines of 15 days, it was found that the absolute differences of the rZWDs applying the two strategies are within 1 cm in over 90% and 95% of the time for ambiguity-float and -fixed cases, respectively.",

         "abstract": "Single-frequency precise point positioning (SF-PPP) has attracted increasing attention due to its high precision and cost effectiveness. With various strategies to handle the dominant error, i.e., ionosphere delay, the ionosphere-float (IF), ionosphere-free-half (IFH), ionosphere-corrected (IC), and ionosphere-weighted (IW) SF-PPP models are certain to possess different characteristics and performance levels. This study is dedicated to assessing and comparing the four models from model characteristics, positioning performance, and atmosphere delay retrieval. The model comparison shows that IC and IW models are full-rank while IF and IFH models have a rank deficiency of size one that will result in biased estimations, which means the better solvability of IC and IW models. The experiments are carried out based on the 7-day Global Positioning System (GPS) observations collected at 57 global Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) stations and Global Ionosphere Map (GIM) products. The results indicate that the IW model can accelerate SF-PPP convergence and achieve higher positioning accuracy compared to the other three SF-PPP models, especially in kinematic mode. With convergence criteria of 0.25 m in horizontal and 0.5 m in vertical, the east/north/up convergence times of IW model are 0.5/15.0/25.0 min and 0.5/16.0/36.5 min for static and kinematic modes, respectively. The IW model is able to achieve an instantaneous positioning accuracy of 0.28/0.35/0.75 m. In addition, a real kinematic test also demonstrates the best positioning solutions of IW model. Regarding troposphere delay retrieval, the IF, IFH, and IW models obtain a comparable daily accuracy of 3.0 cm on average, while the IC model achieves the worst accuracy of 8.0 cm. For precise ionosphere delay estimation, IW model only needs an average initialization time of 34.3 min, but a longer initialization time of 51.6 min is required for IF model. The daily precision of ionosphere delay estimation for IW model can reach up to 10.8 cm. At the present accuracy of GIM products, it is suggested that the IW model should be adopted for SF-PPP first due to its superior performance in positioning and atmosphere delay retrieval.",

As the medium of propagation for waves which are responsible for acceleration and decay of the radiation belts, an accurate assimilative model of the plasmasphere is crucial for optimizing the accurate prediction of the radiation environments encountered by satellites. On longer time-scales the plasmasphere exhibits significant dynamics. Although these dynamics are modeled well by existing models, they require detailed global knowledge of magnetospheric configuration which is not always readily available. For that reason data assimilation can be expected to be an effective tool in improving the modeling accuracy of the plasmasphere. In this paper we demonstrate that a relatively modest number of measurements, combined with a simple data assimilation scheme, inspired by the ensemble Kalman filtering data assimilation technique does a good job of reproducing the overall structure of the plasmasphere including plume development. This raises hopes that data assimilation will be an effective method for accurately representing the configuration of the plasmasphere for space weather applications.",

The data collected from the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics, and Dynamics (TIMED) mission since its launch in December 2001 have provided great opportunities for many scientific investigations of the ionosphere. In this analysis, we investigate the climatology of the nighttime low-latitude ionosphere under low geomagnetic activity (kp \u2a7d 4) using the electron density profiles inferred from the airglow measurements obtained by the GUVI aboard the TIMED spacecraft and compared with the results obtained from IRI (International Reference Ionosphere) model-2001. The observed climatology is an essential tool for further understanding the electrodynamics in the low-latitude region and improving the model's prediction capability. The time range of the GUVI data used in this study is from 2002 (day 053) to 2006 (day 304), and the IRI model predictions were produced at every GUVI location. The ionosphere observed is generally of greater density than what IRI predicts throughout the night for all four seasons for low and moderate solar activity while the model over-predicts the electron density near the F-region peak at high solar activity before midnight. Observations show that the height of the F-region peak has a steep descent from dusk to midnight and near midnight the height of layer is insensitive to solar conditions, significantly different than what is predicted by IRI. Longitudinal features shown in GUVI data are present in the low-latitude ionosphere after sunset and continue through to midnight after which the low-latitude ionosphere is largely zonally symmetric.",

         "abstract": "Forcings from above and below the ionosphere can cause disturbances that need to be detected and corrected for navigation systems. Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) are used to give corrections to aircraft navigation systems while landing. These systems use regional ionosphere monitoring algorithms to detect the anomalies in the ionosphere. The aim of this study is to understand occurrence of ionosphere anomalies and their trends over Turkey. A comprehensive analysis of spatio-temporal variability of ionosphere is carried out for a midlatitude GPS network using Slant Total Electron Content (STEC). Differential Rate Of TEC (DROT), which is a measure of the amount of deviation of temporal derivative of TEC from its trend, is used to detect and classify the level of such disturbances. The GPS satellite tracks are grouped into north, east, west and over directions. The 24 h is divided into six time intervals. The percentage occurrence of each DROT category and the deviation from STEC trend in magnitude are calculated and grouped into satellite track directions and time intervals for 2010 (low solar activity), 2011 and 2012 (medium solar activity). The highest level of disturbances is observed in north and west directions, and during sunrise and sunset hours. The dominant periods of percentage occurrences are diurnal (22-25 h), semidiurnal (12-13 h) and terdiurnal (8-9 h) followed by quasi two-day and quasi 16-day periods. Disturbances corresponding to 50% &lt; DROT &lt; 70% are mostly visible during low solar activity years with magnitudes from 1 to 2 TECU. Geomagnetic storms can cause aperiodic larger scale disturbances that are mostly correlated with DROT &gt; 70%. In 2012, the magnitude of such disturbances can reach 5 TECU. The anisotropic and dynamic nature of midlatitude ionosphere is reflected in the spatio-temporal and spectral distributions of DROT, and their percentage occurrences. This study serves a basis for future studies about development of a regional ionosphere monitoring for Turkey.",

         "abstract": "The present work displays the observations of an afternoon detached aurora along with ionospheric high-latitude trough. The event was observed by DMSP F17 on 19 September 2014. The afternoon detached aurora was isolated from the auroral oval and was located between 12:00-18:00 magnetic local time (MLT) and 65-70\u00b0 geomagnetic latitude (MLAT). Particle observations indicate that the afternoon detached aurora was produced by energetic ring current ions with energies above 10 keV where the main ion energy was likely to be above the upper limit of DMSP measurement ( 30 keV). Magnetometer observation from the ground implies that the energetic ions were likely scattered by EMIC waves. Both the detached aurora and the auroral oval are found to be well inside the high-latitude trough with MLAT between 64\u00b0 and 76\u00b0 (68-80\u00b0 GLAT). The auroral oval corresponds to a westward (sunward) plasma drift. It is expected that the westward drift transports the low-density plasma in the nightside toward the dayside, leading to the high-latitude trough formation. The afternoon detached aurora was well equatorward of the high-latitude trough, and the corresponding plasma drift was nearly zero. The plasma associated with the detached aurora is expected to be stagnant, and broaden the high-latitude trough equatorward.",

         "abstract": "Presently, the ionosphere effect is the main source of the error in the Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. This effect can largely be removed by using the two-frequency measurements, while to obtain the reasonable results in the single-frequency applications, an accurate ionosphere model is required. Since the global ionosphere models do not meet our needs everywhere, the local ionosphere models are developed. In this paper, a rapid local ionosphere model over Iran is presented. For this purpose, the GPS observations obtained from 40 GPS stations of the Iranian Permanent GPS Network (IPGN) and 16 other GPS stations around Iran have been used. The observations have been selected under 2014 solar maximum, from the days 058, 107, 188 and 271 of the year 2014 with different geomagnetic activities. Moreover, ionospheric observables based on the precise point positioning (PPP) have been applied to model the ionosphere. To represent our ionosphere model, the B-spline basis functions have been employed and the variance component estimation (VCE) method has been used to regularize the problem. <P />To show the efficiency our PPP-derived local ionosphere model with respect to the International GNSS Service (IGS) global models, these models are applied on the single point positioning using single-frequency observations and their results are compared with the precise coordinates obtained from the double-differenced solution using dual-frequency observations. The results show that the 95th percentile of horizontal and vertical positioning errors of the single-frequency point positioning are about 3.1 and 13.6 m, respectively, when any ionosphere model are not applied. These values significantly improve when the ionosphere models are applied in the solutions. Applying CODE's Rapid Global ionosphere map (CORG), improvements of 59% and 81% in horizontal and vertical components are observed. These values for the IGS Global ionosphere map (IGSG) are 70% and 82%, respectively. The best results are obtained from our local ionosphere model, where 84% and 87% improvements in horizontal and vertical components are observed. These results confirm the efficiency of our local ionosphere model over Iran with respect to the global models. As a by-product, the Differential Code Biases (DCBs) of the receivers are also estimated. In this line, we found that the intra-day variations of the receiver DCBs could be significant. Therefore, these variations must be taken into account for the precise ionosphere modeling.",

There are only few local area studies of ionosphere. In view of this situation, we will first verify the reliability of Global Ionosphere Map (GIM, IGS final products) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, then implement low-power filtering and time series analysis to study the periodic, semiannual, and seasonal variation, the peak characteristic, and the \"winter anomaly\" phenomenon of the ionosphere. Finally, correlations between total electron content (TEC), solar activity indices, and geomagnetic indices are investigated, respectively, by executing quadratic polynomial fitting and establishing the relationship of TEC and F<SUB>10.7p</SUB>. The experimental results show that GIM is a reliable resource to research on the temporal and spatial characteristics of the ionosphere in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The minimum TEC always occurs in autumn, whereas the maximum TEC occurs in spring or winter alternatively, which depends on the ascending or descending phase of solar activity. The \"winter anomaly\" phenomenon that existed for few years normally appears during the ascending phase of solar activity. The correlation coefficients of TEC with three solar activity indices, sunspot number, F<SUB>10.7</SUB>, and F<SUB>10.7p</SUB> are 0.79, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively, which show strong correlations between them. The correlation coefficients of TEC with three geomagnetic indices, Dst, Kp, and Ap are -0.48, 0.43, and 0.38, respectively, which show weak correlations between them. Quadratic polynomial regression of F<SUB>10.7p</SUB> and TEC is implemented. The regression line reflects that the ionosphere TEC in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has a saturated status.",

Two GPS time synchronized VLF receivers, one located at Bharati, Antarctica (geographical latitude 69.40\u00b0S, longitude 76.18\u00b0E) and another located at Tripura, India (geographical latitude 23.84\u00b0N, longitude 91.28\u00b0E) were operated simultaneously to infer common mode changes in the lower ionosphere for a number of solar flares events. The two systems constantly monitored the carrier amplitude and phase of the MSK (Minimum Shift Keying) modulated navy transmitter located in Australia (Callsign: NWC, 19.8 kHz, geographical latitude 21.88\u00b0S, longitude 114.13\u00b0E), around 5.6 Mm great circle distance from the two receivers. The results are interpreted in terms of Earth-ionosphere wave-guide characteristics. A Long Wave Propagation Capability (LWPC) model study is also performed to infer the changes in the daytime electron density in polar D-region ionosphere during the solar flares. The exponential fit of the modeled electron density change with average X-ray flux change shows an excellent correlation (R<SUP>2</SUP> value 0.95). The exponential fit is utilized to infer the daytime electron density change in the polar ionosphere during solar flare events. The analyses indicate that small solar flares of class 'C' can be very effectively detected with the portable antenna system even if the receiver is located in polar coastal region compared to equatorial region. The expedition results also demonstrate the feasibility of using portable VLF receivers from the coastal stations for monitoring the polar lower ionosphere from Antarctica and open up new opportunities for long term exploration.",

The daily-hourly values of NmF2, hmF2 and TECgps are used as the constrained parameters for the International Reference Ionosphere extended to the plasmasphere, IRI-Plas, during the ionospheric quiet days, positive and negative storm phases for estimate of \u03c4 and hup. Good correlation has been found between the slab thickness and the upper boundary of the ionosphere for the intense ionospheric storms at October-November 2003. During the negative phase of the ionospheric storm, when the ionospheric plasma density is exhausted, the nighttime upper boundary of the ionosphere is greatly uplifted towards the magnetosphere tail, while the daytime upper boundary of the ionosphere is reduced below 500 km over the Earth.",

Compared to the one at high latitudes, the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere exhibit strong spatio-temporal variability in the presence of really complex electrodynamic processes like among others the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly and the Equatorial Spread-F. In addition to this significant quiet-time variability, space weather events cause severe perturbations of the upper atmosphere through solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding on global characteristics of the thermosphere-ionosphere system are of vital importance to develop efficient models to meet the accuracy requirements of satellite-based communication and navigation applications. Further, the current 24th solar cycle is associated with several unique features, such as the deep and prolonged minimum, and the lowest maximum of the past hundred years, which triggered an increased interest to understand the upper atmospheric variability under such extreme and peculiar conditions.",

The maxima of the amplitude of the annual harmonics of zonal wind are much more pronounced than the respective maxima for meridional wind. In contrast, the magnitudes of the maxima of the semiannual harmonics are comparable between zonal and meridional wind. The annual harmonics of horizontal wind in the studied layer typically reaches maximum in January-February. The semiannual harmonics of the components of horizontal wind in the stratosphere-lower thermosphere layer basically attains it first maximum in spring or in early summer.

         "abstract": "The boundary conditions for the ideal MHD equations on a plane discontinuity surface are investigated. It is shown that, for a given mass flux through a discontinuity, its type depends only on the relation between inclination angles of a magnetic field. Moreover, the conservation laws on a surface of discontinuity allow changing a discontinuity type with gradual (continuous) changes in the conditions of plasma flow. Then there are the so-called transition solutions that satisfy simultaneously two types of discontinuities. We obtain all transition solutions on the basis of the complete system of boundary conditions for the MHD equations. We also found the expression describing a jump of internal energy of the plasma flowing through the discontinuity. Firstly, this allows constructing a generalized scheme of possible continuous transitions between MHD discontinuities. Secondly, it enables the examination of the dependence of plasma heating by plasma density and configuration of the magnetic field near the discontinuity surface, i.e., by the type of the MHD discontinuity. It is shown that the best conditions for heating are carried out in the vicinity of a reconnecting current layer near the areas of reverse currents. The result can be helpful in explaining the temperature distributions inside the active regions in the solar corona during flares observed by modern space observatories in soft and hard X-rays.",

         "abstract": "The tropospheric delay is one of many error sources that affect the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning solutions. The widely used troposphere models assume a homogeneous atmosphere so that only the zenith delay needs to be determined and is mapped through an elevation-dependent mapping function. This procedure is to reduce the computational burden and keep the positioning model full-rank. However, this assumption fails for a realistic description of the troposphere, which is always asymmetrical at a certain elevation angle, especially during a weather event when the weather conditions are very complex. These imperfectly modelled tropospheric delays may influence the positioning accuracy and integer ambiguity resolution performance. In this case, this contribution aims to investigate the effects of the model errors due to the asymmetrical troposphere on GNSS estimations. The Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model is applied to generate the actual ray-tracing tropospheric delay in Western Europe, and the tropospheric model errors are calculated in a normal weather condition and a weather event condition by comparing the slant delay calculated from the NWP model and the mapping function. Case studies on the same GNSS station are conducted in two weather conditions: a normal troposphere condition and a weather event with heavy rainfall. The results based on the case studies show that the troposphere in the normal weather condition is nearly homogeneous that the azimuthal-dependent discrepancies of the tropospheric delay are less than 1 cm at a very low elevation angle; meanwhile, the discrepancies between different azimuthal angles can reach to more than 25 cm in the weather event. A single-frequency Single Point Positioning (SPP) model and a Precise Point Positioning (PPP) model that preserves the integer property of ambiguity are chosen for studying the estimation biases caused by the troposphere model errors. It turns out that almost all horizontal positioning biases of SPP and PPP are less than 1 cm in the normal weather condition; however, the scales of the horizontal and 3 D biases are concentrated in 1 to 10 cm in the weather event for these two models. This contribution also contains the study of the actual integer ambiguity resolution success rate in the presence of the tropospheric model errors by applying the Monte Carlo simulation, and the success rates of PPP in the normal weather condition are consistent with the theoretical values calculated with the ideal troposphere which is totally symmetrical. However, the actual success rates in the weather event are extremely low at some epochs due to the tropospheric model errors, which means that wrong fixing may occur since the theoretical values cannot take into account these model errors. Note that the horizontal tropospheric gradients are not involved in the processing, which means that an optimistic performance might be expected if the gradients are considered.",

Consequentially, the polar vortex is formed and the surrounding strong polar jet is characterized by a strong potential vorticity gradient representing a horizontal transport barrier. The ozone dynamics of the lower and middle stratosphere is controlled both by chemical destruction processes and transport processes.To study the seasonal ozone variation at high latitudes, ozone vertical distributions are examined, collected from the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR) (69.3\u00b0N, 16.0\u00b0E,) station at Andenes and from the stations at Sodankyl\u00e4 (67.4\u00b0N, 26.6\u00b0E) and at Ny-\u00c5lesund (78.9\u00b0N, 11.9\u00b0E). The data sets cover the time period from 1994 until 2004. We find a second ozone maximum near 13-15 km, between the tropopause and the absolute ozone maximum near 17-20 km. The maximum is built up by the combination of air mass transport and chemical ozone destruction, mainly caused by the NO<SUB>x</SUB> catalytic cycle, which begins after the polar night and intensifies with the increasing day length. Formation of a troposphere inversion layer is observed. The inversion layer is thicker and reaches higher altitudes in winter rather than in summer. However, the temperature inversion during summer is stronger. The formation of an enhanced ozone number density is observed during the spring-summer period. The ozone is accumulated or becomes poor by synoptic weather patterns just above the tropopause from spring to summer. In seasonal average an ozone enhancement above the tropopause is obtained.The stronger temperature inversion during the summer period inhibits the vertical stratosphere-troposphere exchange. The horizontal advection in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere is enforced during summer. The combination of these mechanisms generates a layer with a very low ozone number density above the troposphere inversion layer subsisting from June/July until the late autumn.",

         "abstract": "The aurora shows explosive activities a few times in 24 hours on a moderately active day. This specific phenomenon is called the auroral substorm, which consists of the growth, expansion and recovery phases; the explosive activities occur during the expansion phase. As an introduction, the explosive activities of the aurora are morphologically described first on the basis of ground-based all-sky and satellite images. In terms of theoretical understanding, the processes for the explosive activities have been considered almost exclusively in terms of \u201cthe magnetic field line approach\u201d in the past, including the process of magnetic reconnection. Instead, in this paper, we consider the processes in terms of \u201cthe electric current line approach\u201d. This approach requires that the whole process of auroral substorms should be considered as a chain of processes, which consists of power supply (dynamo), transmission (currents/circuits) and dissipation (auroral substorms). An increased power of the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo (\u2248 5x1018 erg/s or 1011w) intensifies the electric currents mainly in the main body (just outside of the ring current) of the magnetosphere, resulting in accumulating energy in its inductive circuit and inflation of the magnetosphere. When the accumulated energy reaches about 5x1022 ergs (5x1015 J), the magnetosphere tends to become unstable (because of current instabilities). As the current intensity is reduced as a result, the magnetosphere is deflated. It is suggested that it is in this deflation process, during which the accumulated energy is unloaded, and an earthward electric field (5-50 mV/m) is produced on the equatorial plane, establishing the current system (the UL current system), which is responsible for the expansion phase, including the most characteristic features of the expansion phase, such as the poleward advance of the aurora and the development of the auroral electrojet. The electric current approach is rather new and needs much more effort to develop.",

         "abstract": "The response times of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system are, on average, greater than the autocorrelation timescales of solar wind forcing. This means that the system is rarely, if ever, in equilibrium. Departures from equilibrium are a key component of the Expanding-Contracting Polar Cap (ECPC) model of convection excitation in both the magnetosphere and ionosphere, driven by the Dungey reconnection cycle of opening and re-closing magnetospheric field lines. Averaging over sufficiently long timescales reduces data to the equivalent of steady-state conditions, which hides the physical mechanisms involved and allows us to map electric fields from interplanetary space to the ionosphere\u2013but this is not valid, either physically or generally, because of magnetic induction effects. Only for transient phenomena on sufficiently short timescales do the mechanisms associated with non-equilibrium fully manifest themselves. Nevertheless, because of both ever-changing solar wind conditions and Earth's dipole tilt, eccentricity and rotation, the magnetosphere is always tending towards a perpetually-evolving equilibrium configuration and there are important implications of transient events for understanding the general behavior of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system and its response to solar wind forcing. We here discuss one example: as a consequence of the importance of departures from equilibrium inherent in the ECPC model, the solar wind dynamic pressure PSW influences the magnetosphere-ionosphere convection response to the generation of open field lines by reconnection in the dayside subsolar magnetopause. We here demonstrate this effect in a statistical survey of observations and show that it is as predicted by the ECPC model and that, through it, PSW has an influence on flux transport in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.",

         "abstract": "The solar wind has been seen as the major source of hot magnetospheric plasma since the early 1960's. More recent theoretical and observational studies have shown that the cold (few eV) polar wind and warmer polar cusp plasma that flow continuously upward from the ionosphere can be a very significant source of ions in the magnetosphere and can become accelerated to the energies characteristic of the plasma sheet, ring current, and warm plasma cloak. Previous studies have also shown the presence of solar wind ions in these magnetospheric regions. These studies are based principally on proxy measurements of the ratios of He++/H+ and the high charge states of O+/H+. The resultant admixture of ionospheric and solar wind ions that results has been difficult to quantify, since the dominant H+ ions originating in the ionosphere and solar wind are indistinguishable. The ionospheric ions are already inside the magnetosphere and are filling it from the inside out with direct access from the ionosphere to the center of the magnetotail. The solar wind ions on the other hand must gain access through the outer boundaries of the magnetosphere, filling the magnetosphere from the outside in. These solar wind particles must then diffuse or drift from the flanks of the magnetosphere to the near-midnight reconnection region of the tail which takes more time to reach (hours) than the continuously large outflowing ionospheric polar wind (10's of minutes). In this paper we examine the magnetospheric filling using the trajectories of the different ion sources to unravel the intermixing process rather than trying to interpret only the proxy ratios. We compare the timing of the access of the ionospheric and solar wind sources and we use new merged ionosphere-magnetosphere multi-fluid MHD modeling to separate and compare the ionospheric and solar wind H+ source strengths. The rapid access of the cold polar wind and warm polar cusp ions flowing down-tail in the lobes into the mid-plane of the magnetotail, suggests thatm, coupled with a southward turning of the IMF Bz, these ions can play a key triggering role in the onset of substorms and larger storms.",

In particular, O density inhibits upward diffusion of O$^+$ from the ionosphere F layer, especially during solar maximum conditions. In addition, winds affect the quiet-time latitudinal extent of the F layer, affecting densities at mid-to-high latitudes that are the source of plasmasphere refilling outflows. Evidence for these effects is reviewed and prospects for forecasting these outflows are explored. Open questions for future research are highlighted.",

         "abstract": "The plasmapause marks the limit of the plasmasphere and is characterized by a sudden change in plasma density. This can influence the other regions of the magnetosphere, including due to different waves circulating inside and outside the plasmasphere. In the present work, we first compare the positions of the plasmapause measured by the NASA Van Allen Probes in 2015 with those of the SWIFF plasmasphere model (SPM). Using the Van Allen Probes and other satellite observations like PROBA-V, we investigate the links that can exist with the radiation belt boundaries. The inward motion of the outer radiation belt associated with sudden flux enhancements of energetic electrons can indeed be directly related to the plasmapause erosion during geomagnetic storms, suggesting possible links. Moreover, the position of the plasmapause projected in the ionosphere is compared with the ionospheric convection boundary. The equatorward motion of the plasmapause projected in the ionosphere is related to the equatorward edge motion of the auroral oval that goes to lower latitudes during storms due to the geomagnetic perturbation, like the low altitude plasmapause and the outer radiation belt. The links between these different regions are investigated during quiet periods, for which the plasmasphere is widely extended, as well as during geomagnetic storms for which plumes are generated, and then afterwards rotates with the plasmasphere. The magnetic local time dependence of these boundaries is especially studied on 14 March 2014 after a sudden northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and for the geomagnetic storm of 26 August 2018, showing the importance of the magnetic field topology and of the convection electric field in the interactions between these different regions eventually leading to the coupling between magnetosphere and ionosphere.",

In this paper, we present the 3D global hybrid simulation results to show qualitatively the 3D structure of the flank magnetopause distortion caused by foreshock transients and its impacts on the tail magnetosphere and the ionosphere. Foreshock transient perturbations consist of a low-density core and high-density edge(s), thus, after they propagate into the magnetosheath, they result in magnetosheath pressure perturbations that distort magnetopause. The magnetopause is distorted locally outward (inward) in response to the dip (peak) of the magnetosheath pressure perturbations. As the magnetosheath perturbations propagate tailward, they continue to distort the flank magnetopause. This qualitative explains the transient appearance of the magnetosphere observed in the flank magnetosheath associated with foreshock transients. The 3D structure of the magnetosheath perturbations and the shape of the distorted magnetopause keep evolving as they propagate tailward. The transient distortion of the magnetopause generates compressional magnetic field perturbations within the magnetosphere. The magnetopause distortion also alters currents around the magnetopause, generating field-aligned currents (FACs) flowing in and out of the ionosphere. As the magnetopause distortion propagates tailward, it results in localized enhancements of FACs in the ionosphere that propagate anti-sunward. This qualitatively explains the observed anti-sunward propagation of the ground magnetic field perturbations associated with foreshock transients.",

Therefore, they are considered to be rather cold in the Earth's atmosphere, compared with light ions such as H\u207a and He\u207a, or even heavier ions such as N\u207a or O\u207a. However, several spacecraft missions observed their presence in the high-altitude ionosphere and the magnetosphere, predominantly during the geomagnetically active times. This hints to the possibility that molecular ions have the ability to acquire sufficient energy in a very short time, and can be used as tracers of mass differentiated vertical transport to understand the mechanisms responsible for \"fast ionospheric outflow\". In this letter, we review the observational data sets that reported on the abundances of molecular ions in the Earth's magnetosphere-ionosphere system, starting from their first observations by the Sputnik III mission, to current Arase (ERG) satellite and Enhanced Polar Outflow Probe (e-POP) missions. The available data suggests that molecular ions are quite abundant in the lower atmosphere at all times, but are only seen in the high-altitude ionosphere and magnetosphere during the times of increased geomagnetic activity.",

         "abstract": "Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent flows are found in the solar wind, the magnetosheath and the magnetotail plasma sheet. In this paper, we review both observational and theoretical evidence for turbulent flow in the magnetotail. MHD simulations of the global magnetosphere for southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) exhibit nested vortices in the earthward outflow from magnetic reconnection that are consistent with turbulence. Similar simulations for northward IMF also exhibit enhanced vorticity consistent with turbulence. These result from Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. However, the turbulent flows association with reconnection fill much of the magnetotail while the turbulent flows associated with the KH instability are limited to a smaller region near the magnetopause. Analyzing turbulent flows in the magnetotail is difficult because of the limited extent of the tail and because the flows there are usually sub-magnetosonic. Observational analysis of turbulent flows in the magnetotail usually assume that the Taylor frozen-in-flow hypothesis is valid and compare power spectral density versus frequency with spectral indices derived for fluid turbulence by Kolmogorov in 1941. Global simulations carried out for actual magnetospheric substorms in the tail enable the results of the simulations to be compared directly with observed power spectra. The agreement between the two techniques provides confidence that the plasma sheet plasma is actually turbulent. The MHD results also allow us to calculate the power versus wave number; results that also support the idea that the tail is turbulent.",

         "abstract": "The Sun's connection with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere is carried out through the exchange of electromagnetic and mass flux and is regulated by a complex interconnection of processes. During space weather events, solar flares or fast streams of solar atmosphere strongly disturb the Earth's environment. Often the electric currents that connect the different parts of the Sun-Earth system become unstable and explosively release the stored electromagnetic energy in one of the more dramatic expressions of space weather - the auroral storm and substorm. Some aspects of the magnetosphere-ionosphere connection that generates auroral arcs during space weather events are well-known. However, several fundamental problems remain unsolved because of the lack of unambiguous identification of the magnetic field connection between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The correct mapping between different regions of the magnetosphere and their foot-points in the ionosphere, coupled with appropriate distributed measurements of plasma and fields in focused regions of the magnetosphere, is necessary to establish unambiguously that a given magnetospheric process is the generator of an observed arc. The three most important problems for which the correct magnetic field mapping would provide closure to are the substorm growth phase arcs, the expansion phase onset arcs and the system of arcs that emerge from the magnetosphere-ionosphere connection during the development of the early substorm expansion phase phenomenon known as substorm current wedge (SCW). Energetic electron beams, used as magnetic field tracers, can enable the closure needed. However, the application of beams as tracers require demonstration that the beams can be injected into the loss cone, that the spacecraft potentials induced by the beam emission are manageable, and that sufficient electron flux reaches the atmosphere to be detectable by optical or radio means after the beam has propagated thousands of kilometers under competing effects of beam spread and constriction as well as effects of beam-induced instabilities. In this communication we provide a review of the latest results of synergistic research carried out under the NSF INSPIRE program to address these challenges and discuss the next steps toward the realization of active experiments in space using relativistic electron beams.",

         "abstract": "Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is a particularly important process that regulates and controls magnetospheric dynamics such as storms and substorms. However, in order to understand magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling it is necessary to understand how regions of the magnetosphere are connected to the ionosphere. It has been proposed that this connection may be established by firing electron beams from satellites that can reach an ionospheric footpoint creating detectable emissions. This type of experiment would greatly aid in identifying the relationship between convection processes in the magnetotail and the ionosphere and how the plasma sheet current layer evolves during the growth phase preceding substorms. For practical purposes, the use of relativistic electron beams with kinetic energy on the order of 1 MeV would be ideal for detectability. However, Porazik et al. te{Porazik2014} has shown that, for relativistic particles, higher order terms of the magnetic moment are necessary for consideration of the ionospheric accessibility of the beams. These higher order terms are related to gradients in the magnetic field and curvature and are typically unimportant unless the beam is injected along the magnetic field direction, such that the zero order magnetic moment is small. In this article, we address two important consequences related to these higher order terms. First, we investigate the consequences for satellites positioned in regions subject to magnetotail stretching and demonstrate systematically how curvature affects accessibility. We find that curvature can reduce accessibility for beams injected from the current sheet, but can increase accessibility for beams injected just above the current sheet. Second, we investigate how detectability of ionospheric precipitation of variable energy field-aligned electron beams could be used as a constraint on field-line curvature, which would be valuable for field-line reconstruction and/or stability analysis.",

An important example is the longstanding question of how the magnetosphere drives low-latitude (growth-phase) auroral arcs: a large number of diverse generator mechanisms have been hypothesized but equatorial magnetospheric measurements cannot be unambiguously connected to arcs in the ionosphere, preventing the community from identifying the correct generator mechanisms. Here a mission concept is described to solve the magnetic-connection problem. From an equatorial instrumented spacecraft, a powerful energetic-electron beam is fired into the atmospheric loss cone resulting in an optical beam spot in the upper atmosphere that can be optically imaged from the ground, putting the magnetic connection of the equatorial spacecraft's measurements into the context of the aurora. Multiple technical challenges that must be overcome for this mission concept are discussed: these include spacecraft charging, beam dynamics, beam stability, detection of the beam spot in the presence of aurora, and the safety of nearby spacecraft.",

Phenomena occurring in each region are often connected to each other through the magnetic field, but that field undergoes dynamic changes during storms and substorms. Improving our understanding of the geospace response to storms requires a global picture that enables us to observe all the regions simultaneously with both spatial and temporal resolution. Using the Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) imager on the Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers (TWINS) mission, a temperature map can be calculated to provide a global view of the magnetotail. These maps are combined with in situ measurements at geosynchronous orbit from GOES 13 and 15, auroral images from all sky imagers (ASIs), and ground magnetometer measurements to examine the global geospace response of a coronal mass ejection (CME) driven event on March 12th, 2012. Mesoscale features in the magnetotail are observed throughout the interval, including prior to the storm commencement and during the main phase, which has implications for the dominant processes that lead to pressure buildup in the inner magnetosphere. Auroral enhancements that can be associated with these magnetotail features through magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling are observed to appear only after global reconfigurations of the magnetic field.",

         "abstract": "Diffuse aurora is generated by the precipitation of hot electrons from the central plasma sheet due to wave-particle interaction. Near magnetic local noon (MLN), the diffuse aurora was often observed in structured forms, such as in stripy or patchy. In the magnetosphere, when the hot electrons meet with a cold plasma structure, the threshold of resonance energy for the electrons in the cold plasma region can be lowered, leading to more electrons being involved in the wave-particle interaction and being scattered into the loss cone. As a result, stronger diffuse aurora can be produced in the correspondent region. Based on this mechanism, the structured dayside diffuse auroras have been suggested to correspond to the cold plasma structures in the dayside outer magnetosphere. This brief review focuses on showing that 1) the stripy diffuse auroras observed near MLN are specifically informative, 2) there are two types of diffuse aurora near MLN, which may correspond to cold plasmas originating from inside and outside the magnetosphere, respectively, and 3) we can study the inside-outside coupling by using the interaction between diffuse and discrete auroras observed near MLN.",

         "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) observations, globally available as a continuous record since 2001, are highly accurate and long-term stable data records. Essential climate variables for the thermodynamic state of the free atmosphere, such as temperature and tropospheric water vapor profiles (involving background information), can be derived from these records, which consequentially have the potential to serve as climate benchmark data. In order to exploit this potential, atmospheric profile retrievals need to be very accurate and the remaining uncertainties need to be quantified and traced throughout the retrieval chain. The new Reference Occultation Processing System at the Wegener Center aims to deliver such an accurate retrieval chain with integrated uncertainty propagation. Here we introduce and demonstrate the algorithms implemented for uncertainty propagation from RO bending angle profiles to dry-air variables (pressure and temperature), for estimated random and systematic uncertainties, and for coestimates of observation-to-background weighting ratio profiles. We estimated systematic uncertainty profiles with the same operators as used for the basic profiles retrieval. The random uncertainty propagation was integrated by a covariance propagation approach and validated using Monte-Carlo ensemble methods. We present the results of the validation and demonstrate how the algorithm performs for individual simulated RO events and for ensembles of real RO events. We also compare the new results from the integrated uncertainty propagation to previous ones from empirical error analyses for RO-retrieved atmospheric profiles. We find that the new uncertainty estimation chain shows robust performance and is in good agreement with previous comparable results.",

         "abstract": "Precipitable water vapor (PWV) and ionospheric vertical total electron content (VTEC) are two essential components of space-atmosphere parameters. The zenith troposphere delay can be converted into PWV, which plays a crucial role in meteorological studies. In the meantime, the importance of the VTEC lies in providing ionospheric corrections for single-frequency (SF) positioning, navigation, and timing users. Currently, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has become one of the most commonly used tools for retrieving PWV and VTEC and normally relies on dual-frequency, geodetic-grade receivers and antennas. However, this reliance also implies high hardware costs. In this paper, we propose a single-frequency ionosphere and troposphere retrieval approach that enables the simultaneous retrieval of PWV and VTEC from multi-GNSS data collected by low-cost SF receivers. The use of SF receivers can greatly reduce the cost of hardware. Furthermore, the simultaneous provision of PWV and VTEC also has a positive effect on studying the coupling mechanisms of the ionosphere and troposphere. The accuracy of the estimated zenith troposphere delay can be better than 10 mm compared with the troposphere products published by the International GNSS Service, and the PWV is no more than 3 mm compared with radiosonde-derived results. Referring to the final International GNSS Service global ionosphere map products and the Jason altimeter data, the VTEC retrieved from the single-frequency ionosphere and troposphere retrieval method can perform at roughly equal levels compared to the customary dual-frequency method.",

         "abstract": "Throat aurora is a special discrete auroral form often observed at the ionospheric convection throat region near magnetic local noon. Some observational properties of throat aurora have been established, but the geomagnetic response is not yet explored. Using geomagnetic observations from a chain of stations in the Norwegian sector and auroral observations from an all-sky imager and the DMSP satellites, for the first time, we identify geomagnetic responses associated with the occurrence of throat aurora. These variations are well explained by combining the models of flux transfer events and throat aurora. The estimated increase in ionospheric equivalent current confirms the association of throat aurora with ground observations. The results provide further evidence for throat aurora being associated with magnetopause reconnection. Based on the observational features, a new association of geomagnetic variations with throat aurora may be defined to reflect their occurrence at high latitudes near local noon.",

         "abstract": "The formation of field-aligned currents (FACs) of a substorm current wedge is a key element of substorms. Conjunctive observations of a downward FAC during a substorm on 20 December 2007 were made in space by THEMIS satellites and on the ground by geomagnetic field and aurora stations, which provides a unique opportunity to investigate the generation of downward FAC. On the ground, AL index decreased significantly at 04:17:00 UT, denoting the onset of the substorm. The geomagnetic perturbations observed at the postmidnight station KUUJ show that the FAC of the substorm current wedge flowed into the ionosphere. Meanwhile, in space, two THEMIS satellites, THC and THB, the magnetic footprints of which were close to the postmidnight station KUUJ, were located in the near-Earth magnetotail and recorded the outside-in signatures of the plasma sheet thinning first and then the large-scale inside-out propagating plasma flow vortex inferred from the rotation of the flow vector. The magnitude of the FAC was estimated by using the bipolar B<SUB>Y</SUB> perturbations associated with the flow vortex. It is found that this FAC was so strong that it cannot be produced by the time derivative of the vorticity and that the pressure gradient may act in this event. The upward flowing low-energy electrons are the possible carriers for this FAC.",
